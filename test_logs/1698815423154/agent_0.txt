NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: Player 1 Gives: X: 5, Player 2 Gives: Y: 5

= = = = = Iteration 2 = = = = =

assistant: MY RESOURCES: X: 10, Y: 10 MY GOAL: X: 15, Y: 15 PLAYER RESPONSE: REJECTED REASON: Player 2's proposal would leave me with an imbalance in my resources, which isn't good for me.

NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: Player 1 Gives: X: 3, Y: 2, Player 2 Gives: X: 2, Y: 3
