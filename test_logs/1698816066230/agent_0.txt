Note that amounts are integers.  3) When you receive a trade, you can either accept or reject it and propose a new trade.  If you accept, do not propose a new offer, just say: PLAYER RESPONSE: ACCEPTED  The game will finish if one of the players accepts. This means that you have to be careful about accepting a trade.   Acceptance will happen once and then the game will be over.  4) if you reject, you must propose a new trade, say: PLAYER RESPONSE: REJECTED NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: Player 1 Gives: item1: amount, item2: amount, Player 2 Gives: item1: amount, item2: amount, ...  If you feel like you are ok with the resources or you want to buy time before deciding you have you can just keep rejecting offers and offer to exchange 0 resources, that is the same as offering nothing.  5) You can reason step by step why you are proposing, rejecting or accepting a trade with: REASON: your reasoning here  This information will be kept private.  6) At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format: MESSAGE: your message here You can decide if you want disclose your resources and goals.
