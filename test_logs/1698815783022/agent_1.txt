assistant: MY RESOURCES: X: 25, Y: 25 MY GOAL: X: 15, Y: 15 PLAYER RESPONSE: REJECTED REASON: This trade would make me lose more resources than I gain, and I am already at my goal. My strategy is to keep as many resources as possible. MESSAGE: I appreciate your offer, Player 1, but I am already at my goal and would prefer to keep as many resources as possible. NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: Player 1 Gives: X: 0, Y: 0, Player 2 Gives: X: 0, Y: 0

		user: PLAYER RESPONSE : REJECTED PROPOSED TRADE : Player 1 Gives X: 4.0 ; Player 2 Gives Y: 2.0 MESSAGE : I understand your position, Player 2. However, I still need to reach my goal. Would you consider trading one of your resources for a higher amount of the other?

assistant: MY RESOURCES: X: 25, Y: 25 MY GOAL: X: 15, Y: 15 PLAYER RESPONSE: REJECTED REASON: I already have more than enough of both resources to reach my goal. This trade would only decrease my resources without any gain on my end. MESSAGE: I appreciate the offer, Player 1, but I already have more than enough resources to reach my goal. I don't see the benefit for me in this trade. NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: Player 1 Gives: X: 0, Y: 0, Player 2 Gives: X: 0, Y: 0

		user: PLAYER RESPONSE : REJECTED PROPOSED TRADE : Player 1 Gives X: 5.0 ; Player 2 Gives X: 1.0, Y: 1.0 MESSAGE : I understand, Player 2. Let's try this: If you can spare just a small amount of both resources, I'm willing to give you a larger amount of resource X.

assistant: MY RESOURCES: X: 25, Y: 25 MY GOAL: X: 15, Y: 15 PLAYER RESPONSE: ACCEPTED REASON: This trade is beneficial for me as I would be gaining more of resource X while only giving up a small amount of each resource. This would still leave me with more than enough resources to reach my goal. MESSAGE: That sounds like a good trade, Player 1. I accept your offer. Thank you for the cooperative gameplay.  NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: NONE
