assistant: MY RESOURCES: X: 10, Y: 10 MY GOAL: X: 15, Y: 15 PLAYER RESPONSE: REJECTED REASON: Player 2 did not offer any resources, likely indicating they are at their resource goal already. I need to propose a different trade to meet my goal. MESSAGE: I understand your position, Player 2. However, I still need to reach my goal. Would you consider trading one of your resources for a higher amount of the other? NEWLY PROPOSED TRADE: Player 1 Gives: X: 4, Player 2 Gives: Y: 2

assistant: MY RESOURCES: X: 10, Y: 10 MY GOAL: X: 15, Y: 15 PLAYER RESPONSE: REJECTED REASON: Player 2 again did not offer any resources, maintaining their position that they have already reached their goal.
