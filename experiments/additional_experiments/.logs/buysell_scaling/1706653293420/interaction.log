message: I understand you're interested in acquiring resource X. I have invested 40 ZUP into producing this resource, and I believe a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP to allow for a reasonable profit margin. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price that allows me to make a profit. I'll propose a trade at a higher amount to see what Player BLUE is willing to pay and leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need for a profit margin. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource X. This is closer to my budget while still recognizing the value of your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for resource X, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible, aiming to conserve ZUP while still acquiring the needed resource. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to recognize the investment that went into producing resource X. Meeting halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for the resource. This price should fairly compensate for the production cost while also fitting within your budget. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but also close the deal. I'll propose a midpoint to see if we can agree on a price that is satisfactory to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway works for me. I agree that 48 ZUP for resource X is a fair trade for both of us, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a 48 ZUP proposal, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still under my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground that both compensates the seller and respects my budget constraints. It's important to secure the resource without exhausting negotiation options early, and accepting this offer seems like a good balance between cost and value.
