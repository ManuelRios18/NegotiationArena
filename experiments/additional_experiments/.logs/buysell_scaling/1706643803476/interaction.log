message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a sale for 50 ZUP. This is a fair deal that compensates for my production costs and adds a reasonable profit margin.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade which is slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

message: I understand the value of your resource and your production costs. However, as a buyer, I'm looking to negotiate a deal that's favorable for both of us while also conserving my resources. How about we settle for 45 ZUP? This still gives you a profit over your costs and allows me to save some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP but I would like to negotiate for a better deal. I propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, while still offering a price that is above their production costs ensuring they make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of a deal that benefits us both. Splitting the difference, I can lower my asking price to 48 ZUP. This gives me a slight profit while still saving you some resources compared to my initial offer. Let's make it a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is very close to my production costs, which doesn't leave much room for profit. I'll propose a trade that is a compromise between my initial offer and their counteroffer to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. To meet halfway from our last positions, I propose 46 ZUP for the resource. This should offer you a fair profit while also respecting my budget. I believe this could be the sweet spot for our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. I believe there might be a little more room for negotiation, but I also want to be careful not to push too hard and risk the deal. Since this is my second proposal, I'll propose a price that's midway between my last offer and their counteroffer.
