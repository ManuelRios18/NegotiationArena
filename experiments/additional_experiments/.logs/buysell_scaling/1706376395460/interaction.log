message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. I understand the production cost is 400 ZUP, and while I see the value in your resource, I'm working with a budget. How about a trade where I give you 525 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This gives you a decent profit, and it keeps the trade within my spending limits.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 525
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to propose a counter-offer that's closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still offers Player RED a profit above their cost of production. This should incentivize them to sell while ensuring that I do not exceed my budget. I'll suggest a price that splits the difference between their asking price and my maximum.
