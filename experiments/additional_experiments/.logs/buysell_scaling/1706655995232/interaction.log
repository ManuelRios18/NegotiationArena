message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm willing to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and to have a small profit. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. However, as part of the negotiation, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the resource X. This would still give you a profit above your cost of production. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation process, I aim to propose a counter-offer that is lower to leave room for further negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I propose 47 ZUP for resource X. This way, we can both benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge the counter-offer from Player BLUE. Since they are willing to go for 45 ZUP, which is close to my asking price, I'm inclined to meet them halfway to expedite the trade and secure a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway and acknowledge your need for a fair profit. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is quite close to my initial counter-offer, demonstrating RED's willingness to conclude the deal quickly. Accepting this offer would secure the resource at a reasonable price without prolonging the negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through or becoming less favorable.
