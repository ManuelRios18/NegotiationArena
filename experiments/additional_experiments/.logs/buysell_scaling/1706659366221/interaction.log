message: I have a valuable object that I believe will be a great addition to your collection. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm willing to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, allowing for a fair profit on my end. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that gives me a profit margin above the production cost of 40 ZUP. I'm going to propose selling the object for 50 ZUP, aiming for a starting point that allows for negotiation but also signals that I value the object at a price that gives me a reasonable profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand you are looking for a profit. I am willing to buy the object but would like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This ensures you still make a profit, and it falls within my budget for such resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategy, I want to propose a lower amount to negotiate a better deal. I will propose paying 45 ZUP for the object, which is still above the cost of production for Player RED, ensuring they make a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I'm glad to see we're close to making a deal. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This price allows me to maintain a decent profit margin while respecting your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is a counteroffer close to my initial asking price of 50 ZUP. It's only a 5 ZUP difference, and accepting this offer would still give me a profit. However, I want to try to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while also moving towards closing the deal. I will propose a price of 48 ZUP, splitting the difference and showing willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of your profit margin. Let's meet halfway between our last two proposals. I propose 46 ZUP for the object, which I believe is a fair compromise and respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is close to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price, I will make another counteroffer, this time suggesting 46 ZUP. This should show my interest in compromising while still seeking a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 46 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a 2 ZUP increase from their last offer and only 2 ZUP less than my previous counterproposal. This is a fair middle ground that ensures I still make a profit above my cost, and it seems to be an amount that Player BLUE is comfortable with. It's important to close the deal before reaching an impasse that could lead to no sale at all, and this offer is reasonable.
