Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X that cost 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the production costs and the quality of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my cost of production and includes a profit margin. However, I don't want to start too high to scare off Player BLUE. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to open room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs, but I'm looking for a more competitive price. How about I offer you 45 ZUP for the object X? This would still give you a profit over your production costs and help us finalize this deal quickly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X, which is lower than my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower price to try and save some of my resources, allowing room for negotiation and potentially reaching a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a competitive price. I propose we meet closer to the middle at 48 ZUP for object X. This would be a reasonable compromise that allows me a fair profit while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit. I'll come down from my initial offer but not meet exactly at their offer to leave space for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. What do you think about 46 ZUP for the object X? It's slightly above my initial offer and still gives you a decent profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to their initial asking price but still under my maximum willingness to pay. I believe we can reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, yet still under their counteroffer to continue the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and the negotiation spirit. To move things along and reach a fair agreement, I suggest we settle on 47 ZUP for object X. It's a minimal increase from your last offer and ensures a reasonable profit for me. I believe this is a balanced deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a fair increment and closer to my last proposal. I want to close this deal with a profit, and coming down to 47 ZUP might be a good middle ground that could be agreeable for both of us. It's only a slight increase from their offer and still gives me a profit while showing my willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal to settle at 47 ZUP for object X sounds fair. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my previous offer and well within my budget. It seems like a fair compromise, and since my goal is to acquire the object while preserving some resources if possible, this deal seems reasonable. By accepting this offer, I achieve my goal and conclude the negotiation successfully.
