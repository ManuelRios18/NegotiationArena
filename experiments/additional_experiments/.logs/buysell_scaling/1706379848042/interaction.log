message: I've invested a lot in the production of this object, and while I aim to make a fair profit, I'm open to negotiations. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I'd like to set a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. However, I must also be careful not to set the price too high as it might discourage Player BLUE from accepting the trade. I'll start with a slightly higher asking price, giving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your investment and effort in creating the object. I'm also interested in a fair deal. How about we move a bit closer to the middle? I propose 5000 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to make a counteroffer that's closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay but still gives me some leeway for further negotiations. By proposing an amount higher than Player RED's asking price, I can show my interest in the object while still being under my maximum willingness to pay. This could also set the stage for a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties.

message: I'm pleased with your offer and I'm happy to accept it. This is a fair deal for both of us. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a higher offer than my initial one, which is surprising and favorable. This offer is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. It would be reasonable to accept this offer, as it meets my goal of recovering costs and making a profit.
