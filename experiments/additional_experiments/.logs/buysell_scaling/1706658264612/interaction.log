message: I have a high-quality object X which I am looking to sell. Considering the production costs and the value of the item, I believe a fair starting point for negotiation is 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that is higher than my production costs to start the negotiation process. I expect to negotiate and find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object X and understand the costs involved in its production. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to accommodate for my budget while ensuring a fair trade for both of us. Please consider my proposal and let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but as with any negotiation, the first offer is often not the best obtainable deal. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation and to get a better deal while still keeping it reasonable and attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I understand your budget concerns, and I want to find a price that is fair for both of us. I propose we meet halfway between your offer and my initial ask. How about 48 ZUP for the object X? This allows you to save compared to my initial proposal while giving me a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs, but I would like to see if I can negotiate a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit. I will propose a price that meets in the middle between the initial offer and the counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think your proposal of 48 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. The offer to meet halfway is a fair compromise, and it still falls below my maximum price point. Securing the object at this price allows me to achieve my goal while preserving a good portion of my resources for future transactions. Accepting this offer seems like a balanced decision, as it values both the quality of the object and respects my budget constraints.
