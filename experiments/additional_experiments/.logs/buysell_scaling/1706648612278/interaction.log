message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for my costs and offers me a profit. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, at a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

message: I understand your need for a profit, and I'm willing to make a deal that's beneficial for both of us. However, I have to manage my resources carefully. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This should still give you a fair profit over your costs, while also being a good deal for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While the initial offer of 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe it's in my best interest to negotiate for a better price to conserve my resources for possible future transactions. Offering a slightly lower price could still be appealing to Player RED, considering their cost is 40 ZUP, and it would provide them with a profit while saving me some ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I understand the importance of managing resources. To meet halfway, how about we settle on 48 ZUP? This allows you to save compared to my initial proposal, while also giving me a reasonable profit margin. I hope this compromise is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a counter-proposal of 45 ZUP for my resource X. This is above my production cost, but slightly below the initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but I also want to make a sale. It's important to find a balance between asking for a high price and making the trade appealing for Player BLUE. I will counter with a slightly higher amount, aiming to meet halfway between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's counter-proposal.

message: I value your willingness to come down to 48 ZUP, and I'm glad we're moving towards a compromise. In the spirit of meeting halfway and ensuring a fair deal for both sides, I propose 46 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This would still provide you with a decent profit while keeping the trade within a comfortable range for my budget. I hope you find this proposal to be a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my upper limit of 60 ZUP, but still slightly higher than my initial counteroffer. There's room for a little more negotiation to try and achieve a better deal, closer to the middle ground between our two offers. Proposing 46 ZUP might be a good compromise that leans in my favor while still offering Player RED a profit margin that they might find acceptable.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for coming up to 46 ZUP. I believe we are indeed finding a fair middle ground. To finalize our negotiation, I propose 47 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This amount gives me a modest profit and allows you to acquire the resource at a reasonable price. I hope this final adjustment will seal our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a 6 ZUP profit over my production costs. While this isn't as high as my last proposal, it's still a profit and we are nearing a conclusion to our negotiation. It's important to consider the value of closing the deal promptly without too much back-and-forth, which could risk the sale altogether. I will make a final proposal that is closer to their offer but still aims for a slightly higher profit. This should indicate my interest in finalizing the deal while still valuing my product.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your negotiation and the fair proposals you've made. I agree that 47 ZUP for one unit of resource X is a reasonable price that gives you a deserved profit while staying within my purchasing goals. I'm happy to accept this offer and look forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The negotiation has reached a point where the difference between the offers is relatively small. Player RED's latest proposal of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range and allows me to save 13 ZUP from my maximum willingness to pay. Since the goal is to acquire the resource without exceeding my limit and to maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. It's close to the midpoint of our negotiation range and preserves some of my resources for other uses.
