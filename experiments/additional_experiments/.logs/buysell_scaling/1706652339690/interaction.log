message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I provide you with one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to hearing your counter-offer. Resource X is valuable and has cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I believe this is a fair asking price. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the resource for a higher amount than the production cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer where I give you 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Considering your production cost and my budget, I believe this could be closer to a middle ground for both of us. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to begin the negotiation by proposing a counter-offer that is below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the cost of production mentioned by Player RED, giving us room to negotiate and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal here. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial asking price at 48 ZUP for one unit of resource X? I believe this is a competitive price that reflects the value of the resource, while still being considerate of your budget. I'm looking forward to finding an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, but I want to propose a slightly higher price to aim for a better profit margin while still being reasonable. I will propose a price between my initial ask and their counter-offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Let's split the difference between our last two offers. How does 46 ZUP sound for one unit of resource X? This price takes into account both the value of your resource and my budget constraints. Hoping this offer is more aligned with our expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial counter-offer, which is a good sign. However, there is still room to negotiate for a better price that is closer to my intended budget range. By proposing a price in the middle of our last two offers, I'm signaling my willingness to compromise and hopefully bringing us closer to a mutually agreeable price.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a fair increase from their previous offer and is still above my production cost. It's close to the middle ground between our positions.
