message: I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's a valuable item, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I aim to at least break even or make a profit. I don't have information about Player BLUE's willingness to pay or resources, so I will start with a higher asking price as an opening move in the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This is still above your production costs and ensures you make a profit. Let's find a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's a good practice to negotiate a better deal, so I'll propose a lower amount while still keeping it reasonable. I also want to leave room for further negotiation if needed, so I won't go too low.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I'm glad to see we're close to a deal. To meet halfway between our initial positions, I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This should be a beneficial deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a profit. However, as this is still early in the negotiation and I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer, I want to aim for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I agree that 48 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's go ahead with this deal. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a fair middle ground. It allows for a profit on their part and stays within my budget. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and efficiently, which is beneficial.
