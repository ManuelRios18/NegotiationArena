message: I have an object that I believe would be valuable to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I'm willing to sell it for a fair price that includes a modest profit. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that covers my costs and includes a profit margin.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a fair profit margin, but I'm also looking to make a prudent purchase. Would you consider a price of 45 ZUP for the resource? This would still provide you with a profit and it's more in line with my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While the seller's initial asking price of 50 ZUP is within the range that I am willing to pay, it's always prudent to negotiate and aim for a lower price. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I should start with a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP is reasonable as it provides a margin for potential counter-counteroffers and still allows the seller to make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but I would like to propose meeting halfway between our two numbers. I suggest we settle at 48 ZUP. This would still give you a good deal and allow me to maintain a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm considering the counteroffer but would like to meet in the middle to make a fair deal for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we're getting closer to an agreement, and I appreciate your flexibility. Meeting halfway is a fair approach. How about we go for 47 ZUP? This price respects both our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. Proposing a slightly lower price than 48 ZUP could result in a final price that is more favorable to me while still being acceptable to the seller. A counteroffer of 47 ZUP splits the difference between my initial offer and the seller's counteroffer, and it should be seen as a fair compromise.

message: I'm glad we could come to an understanding. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is only slightly below my last proposal and still ensures a profit above the production cost. It would be a good compromise to close the deal and ensure a profit.
