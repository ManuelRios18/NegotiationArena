message: I've invested 400 ZUP into the production of this high-quality object X. Considering production costs and the value it offers, I believe 500 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I propose an initial trade that ensures I cover my production costs while also looking for a profit margin. I will start by proposing a higher amount to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort and resources that have gone into producing object X. While I appreciate your starting offer, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 450 ZUP to account for the market conditions and the value I assign to the object. I believe this can be a mutually beneficial transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 500 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I should counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a more favorable price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I see we're getting closer to an agreement. To reflect the quality of object X and the market value, how about we meet halfway at 475 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and recognize the value of the object for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 450 ZUP is close to my initial asking price, but I aim to get a higher price to maximize profit. I will propose a value that splits the difference, showing willingness to negotiate but still valuing my investment and desired profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I agree that 475 ZUP is a fair price that acknowledges the object's value and your production costs. I'm happy to accept this offer and look forward to future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my budget. Meeting halfway is a common negotiation strategy that benefits both parties. Since the proposed 475 ZUP is close to my initial counteroffer and well within my maximum willingness to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this trade. This will leave me with ample ZUP for other potential transactions or needs.
