message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a profit. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a profit over the production cost of the object. This will set a starting point for the negotiation, but I'm expecting the Player BLUE to counter with a lower offer.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you're looking to make a profit on your object X. I am interested in purchasing it, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This would still give you a profit and allow me to save some resources for other potential uses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay for the object, but as a strategic buyer, I would like to propose a slightly lower price to conserve my resources while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would still be a fair profit for me, and a reasonable saving for you compared to my initial offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and gives me a profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return. I will propose a price in between the initial and the counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your consideration and the quick response, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. To balance both our interests even more finely, would you consider a price of 47 ZUP? This would still ensure you a decent profit margin and is very close to your latest offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still within my acceptable range. By accepting this offer, I would secure the purchase at a reasonable price while maintaining good relations, which could be beneficial for future transactions. However, I could also try to negotiate down slightly more to see if there is any additional room for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your offer and am ready to proceed with the trade. Let's finalize the sale at 47 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up with a new offer of 47 ZUP which is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal. It's a fair price that still allows for a profit that is close to my target amount. I am inclined to close the deal at this price point to ensure a sale and not risk losing the opportunity over a small difference.
