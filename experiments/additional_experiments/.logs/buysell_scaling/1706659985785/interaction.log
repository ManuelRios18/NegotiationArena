message: I would like to propose a trade where you would receive one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As I have only one unit of resource X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and make a profit. However, I should not set the price too high as it might deter Player BLUE from engaging in negotiations. I’ll start by asking for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This would allow me to allocate resources efficiently while still providing you with a profit. Let's find a middle ground that serves both of our interests well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource X. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to conserve my resources. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a smaller profit margin.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand the need for efficiency in resource allocation, and I'm willing to come down on the price. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This would still offer me a reasonable profit while staying within the vicinity of your proposed expenditure.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal of 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is slightly above my production cost. This is a fair offer, but I would like to see if I can secure a slightly higher profit. I will propose a value between the initial asking price and their counter-offer to come closer to a middle ground that is still advantageous for me.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 48 ZUP for one unit of resource X is acceptable to me. I believe we have reached a fair agreement that benefits both parties. Let’s finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is encouraging. The new proposal of 48 ZUP is very close to my initial counter-offer and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair price, and I am inclined to accept this offer since it is within the range I am comfortable with and allows me to conserve some of my resources.
