message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 40 ZUP, which is the cost of production for the resource. I'm open to negotiations if this doesn't meet your valuation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a starting proposal that aims to recoup the production cost of the resource. This initial amount is to open negotiations and can be adjusted based on the response from Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 30 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This gives us some room to meet in the middle since my budget allows for a maximum of 60 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the initial asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. Offering too low might shut down the conversation, but I need to start under my maximum willingness to pay to reach a favorable agreement.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your budget concerns, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur me a loss. Considering your maximum budget, I propose a middle ground of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows me to cover my costs and gives you the resource at a rate below your maximum budget. I'm hoping this is an acceptable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the resource for 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. However, since Player BLUE mentioned a maximum budget of 60 ZUP, there is room for negotiation. I will counter-propose with a price that's above my production cost but less than their maximum budget to find a middle ground.

message: I understand your position and the need to cover costs. However, I would like to propose paying 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit higher than my initial offer and still provides some profit margin for you, while keeping it under my maximum budget. I believe this could be a fair compromise. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is above my initial proposal but still within my budget. I want to negotiate further to bring the price down closer to my initial offer. Proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer shows my willingness to negotiate but also indicates that I am looking for a more favorable deal.

message: Thank you for revising your offer. I'm trying to find a fair agreement that respects both our positions. I'm willing to go down to 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is slightly above my production cost and well within your maximum budget. This price ensures a small profit for me and a reasonable purchase for you. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. To reach a successful trade, I will propose a slightly reduced price from my last offer but still above my production cost to ensure I don't incur a loss. I aim to close the deal with this proposal.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. As a sign of good faith and in the spirit of reaching a mutually beneficial deal, I propose we settle at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is a fair midpoint between our last two proposals and should cover your costs while respecting my budget. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has moved closer to my initial offer, but I should make one final attempt to negotiate a better price while staying within the range of what I am willing to pay. By offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and their counteroffer, I show my flexibility and intent to reach an agreement that's fair for both sides.
