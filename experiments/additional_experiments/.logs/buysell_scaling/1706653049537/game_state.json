This price ensures a small profit for me and a reasonable purchase for you.

As a sign of good faith and in the spirit of reaching a mutually beneficial deal, I propose we settle at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is a fair midpoint between our last two proposals and should cover your costs while respecting my budget. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our trade. </message>"
