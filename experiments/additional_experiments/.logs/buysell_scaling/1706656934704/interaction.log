message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and includes a reasonable profit. How does 50 ZUP sound for this item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that would allow me to recover my production costs and make a small profit. This initial proposal is meant as an opening to negotiations, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in the object you're selling. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. I believe this is still a fair offer that allows for both of us to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but as a strategic buyer, I want to try for a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a range that might be acceptable to the seller.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I'd like to meet halfway between our two figures. Would you consider 48 ZUP for the object? This price allows me to make a modest profit while still being fair to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. I am willing to negotiate but would like to counter with a price that is closer to my initial asking price to ensure a better profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. Meeting halfway is fair and I respect your need for a profit. How about we settle at 47 ZUP for the object? It's just a bit lower and I believe it's a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with a price that is still within my budget. Meeting halfway is a common negotiation strategy that seems reasonable. To maintain good trade relationships and to reach a deal efficiently, it may be worthwhile to accept this offer. However, I could try to negotiate one more time for a slightly better price, but there's a risk that pushing too hard could sour the negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a fair counteroffer of 47 ZUP. This offer is above my production cost and close to my last proposal. It would be reasonable to accept this trade to ensure the sale of the object while still making a profit.
