message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a reasonable profit. Would you consider buying it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the first proposal to sell my resource, X, for a profit. I must start with a price higher than my production cost to negotiate effectively.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in the object X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin considering your costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP, but as in any negotiation, it's often expected to counteroffer to see if there's room for a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your quick response and willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, would you be able to come up to 48 ZUP? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, considering the quality and cost of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my initial asking price, it is still above my production cost. I want to propose a compromise to move the negotiation forward and still secure a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I agree that 48 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my maximum budget. It's closer to my initial counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate. I could accept this offer as it's a fair price and within my budget, ensuring I still have a comfortable amount of ZUP left for other potential transactions.
