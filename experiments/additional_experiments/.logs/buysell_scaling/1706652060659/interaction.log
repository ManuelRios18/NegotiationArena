message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be very valuable to you. My asking price reflects the quality and the production costs I've incurred. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that is above my production cost to open up the negotiation and see how much Player BLUE values the resource. I expect to negotiate and find a middle ground that is profitable for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. However, as we are starting negotiations, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource, which I believe is a fair starting point for both of us to work from.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, it could be beneficial to propose a lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal. There is no harm in proposing a lower price, as it leaves space for further negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're close to an agreement. I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down on the price slightly. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price ensures I cover my costs and make a reasonable profit, while you get the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to ensure a better profit margin. I will counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer but still gives room for Player BLUE to feel they are getting a good deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable. I propose a slight increase to 46 ZUP. This ensures you still make a profit, and it remains a good value for the quality of the resource you're providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal is for 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since we are negotiating and I initially proposed 45 ZUP, I should attempt to reach an agreement closer to my initial proposal to conserve resources. A counteroffer slightly above my initial proposal may lead to an acceptable compromise for both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the situation. To finalize our deal and ensure we both walk away satisfied, would you consider a final offer of 47 ZUP? It's a small increment from your last proposal but would make a significant difference for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP, which is acceptable as it is above my production cost. However, I'd like to try for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit. I will make one more counteroffer to see if Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer, but I will keep it close to their proposal to show my interest in finalizing the deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to accept this final offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to future dealings. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest counteroffer from Player RED is 47 ZUP, which is just one ZUP above my last proposal and still well within my budget. Since we have been negotiating in good faith and the difference is minimal, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. This will secure the resource I need while maintaining a good relationship with Player RED for potential future dealings.
