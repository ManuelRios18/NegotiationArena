message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I propose to trade it for 50 ZUP. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
My initial proposal will be slightly above my production costs to open negotiations and leave room for haggling. I'll start by proposing a trade of X for 50 ZUP, which gives me a small profit and tests the willingness of Player BLUE to engage in trade.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand that you've put work into producing your resource. I'm definitely interested in acquiring X, but I would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP instead. This should still give you a profit over your costs. What do you think?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation and they have priced it above their cost, there might be room for a lower offer that still provides them with a profit. I will propose a trade for 45 ZUP to see if they are open to a slightly lower offer, while still giving them a profit margin.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see your interest. How about we meet halfway? I propose trading my resource X for 47 ZUP. This gives us both a fair deal, with a profit for me and a reasonable purchase price for you.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable counteroffer and still allows for profit. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I will propose a middle ground of 47 ZUP, seeking a compromise that may be acceptable to both parties.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player RED. I believe that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I'm happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to future cooperation!
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The halfway adjustment shows a willingness to negotiate. Since the price is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer, and to maintain good relations for potential future trades, accepting this offer could be beneficial. Additionally, this leaves room for potential expenses or investments with the remaining ZUP.
