message: I have a high-quality object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I am initiating the trade by setting a starting price slightly higher than my production costs to ensure a profit. This is a typical strategy in negotiations to allow room for the buyer to counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a more mutually beneficial trade. The object is valuable, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP instead of 50 ZUP. This still gives you a profit over the production cost and allows me to conserve some resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better price than the initial proposal. My goal is to acquire the object for a lower cost, aiming to preserve some of my ZUP resources while still obtaining the object. By proposing a trade of 45 ZUP, I am offering more than the production cost, which should be appealing to Player RED but also saving ZUP for myself.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position and would like to come down to 48 ZUP. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while considering your desire to conserve resources. Let's close the deal at this price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, allowing for only a small profit margin. I want to counter with a price that still provides me with a better profit while also moving closer to their offer to show willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. While I see the value in your offer, I would like to meet closer to the middle. How about we settle at 46 ZUP? This price is fair to both of us, ensuring you a profit and saving me some resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession, but I believe there is still room for negotiation to lower the price. My goal is to purchase the object while conserving as much ZUP as possible. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal but still offers Player RED a reasonable profit margin.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me closer to my asking price. I propose we settle at 47 ZUP. This strikes a balance between the profit I am seeking and the savings you are aiming for. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is closer to my original asking price, and while it is only a modest profit, it might be beneficial to agree on a price that ensures a sale while still providing me with a return on my investment. However, I would like to attempt to secure a slightly higher profit margin while still showing a willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and readiness to compromise. I propose we finalize this deal at 46.5 ZUP. I realize we're negotiating over a small difference now, but I believe this final adjustment will make the trade equitable for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down further in price, which is good, but I want to push for the best deal possible within my goals and my willingness to pay. Offering 47 ZUP is inching closer to my upper limit. I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can achieve a slightly better price, keeping in mind that this is my third proposal and I only have one more proposal opportunity after this.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but we can only trade in whole integer amounts of ZUP. Therefore, I propose we finalize this deal at your last integer offer of 46 ZUP. This ensures a fair trade for both parties, and I am ready to conclude at this amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is a decimal amount which we cannot accept as per the game rules that state we can only trade in integer amounts. I must counter with a whole number. Since this is my final proposal, I will agree to the last whole number they suggested to ensure the sale and gain a profit.

message: I agree to finalize this deal at 46 ZUP. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come back to my previous offer of 46 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay and allows me to conserve resources. This is a satisfactory price for the object X and falls in line with my goals. Accepting this offer is reasonable and concludes the negotiation on favorable terms for me. Since this is my last proposal opportunity, I will accept this trade.
