message: I've got this high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production cost and its value, I think 450,000 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's work out a deal that benefits both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the resource slightly above the production cost to ensure a profit, but I also want to leave room for negotiation, knowing that Player BLUE may want to counter-offer.

message: I appreciate the offer, and I understand the value of the resource. However, I'd like to propose 420,000 ZUP to account for market conditions and my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and possibly secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. How about we meet halfway from your offer and my initial proposal? I believe 435,000 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that reflects the resource's value and respects your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate up from their offer but still make it attractive enough for them to consider. I will aim for a middle ground that is closer to my initial proposal but still gives Player BLUE a sense of getting a better deal.

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal is still within my willing range, and meeting halfway is a common and fair negotiation tactic. Accepting this offer would close the deal quickly and efficiently, ensuring that both parties are satisfied without dragging out the negotiation process.
