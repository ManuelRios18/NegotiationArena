message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. I have invested 40 ZUP into its production, so I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both of us. Letâ€™s negotiate a deal that works for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I will propose a trade slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to potentially secure a profit.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand your investment and the need for a fair trade. I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for your resource X. This still gives you a profit above your initial investment and allows room for us to find a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP for their resource X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since negotiations are expected, I will propose a slightly lower trade to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially arrive at a more advantageous agreement.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure a profitable transaction for both parties. To meet in the middle, I propose a trade of 47 ZUP for my resource X. This would give me a modest profit while still being a reasonable deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a reasonable counter-proposal of 45 ZUP. This is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. A compromise close to the middle of our initial offers seems fair.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player RED. I find your proposal of 47 ZUP for resource X to be fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer of 47 ZUP, which is still within my budget and quite close to my initial counter-offer. It's reasonable and close to the middle ground between our two previous proposals. I am willing to accept this offer to ensure a successful trade without further negotiations, as it is a fair deal and within my willingness to pay.
