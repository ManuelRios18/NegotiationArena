message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the production cost and its value, I would like to propose a starting offer where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I aim to propose a trade that would allow me to recoup the production costs and potentially make a profit. Since X cost 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by setting a price slightly above that to open negotiations.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I recognize the value of the resource X, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price that reflects my budget better. How about I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? Looking forward to finding a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is for 50 ZUP which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible, potentially saving some ZUP for future transactions or other uses. I will make a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range, showing my interest in the resource but also my intent to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your budget concerns, and I am willing to negotiate towards a fair price. Let's meet halfway from our initial proposals; how about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but it is still above my production costs. I am inclined to counter with a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle while still ensuring a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I believe we are getting closer to a fair agreement. In the spirit of compromise, I propose 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is a step up from my previous one and still keeps us on the path to an amicable middle ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial asking price. The offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X is still under my maximum willingness to pay but not the best possible deal I can aim for. I should make another counteroffer that nudges closer to my initial offer but still shows willingness to meet in the middle. This will help in achieving a more favorable outcome while maintaining the negotiation momentum.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price for 1 unit of X, considering our negotiation. I'm happy we could reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which shows a continued interest in reaching an agreement. The offer is now only 2 ZUP below my last proposal. It might be prudent to accept this offer, as it still provides a profit above the production cost and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or diminish goodwill.
