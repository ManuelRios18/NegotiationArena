message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering you my valuable object X. It cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, and I believe it will be a great asset to you. I'm asking for 4500 ZUP in return, ensuring I cover my costs and gain a reasonable profit. I am open to hearing your counteroffer. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I am Player RED and I need to sell my object X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal should cover my production costs and also provide me with some profit. I will propose a trade that is slightly above my costs, assuming that Player BLUE will want to negotiate the price down.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you're seeking to cover your costs and gain some profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 4000 ZUP for object X. This meets your production cost and is a starting point for our negotiation. I'm sure we can find a fair trade that satisfies both of our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is advantageous to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for adjustment and to find a mutually beneficial middle ground. A counteroffer of 4000 ZUP would match their production cost, ensuring they do not incur a loss, and it would also leave room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs of object X. In the spirit of negotiation and to reach a fair deal that offers me a modest profit for my investment, I propose a trade for 4250 ZUP. I believe this is a fair midpoint that respects both our positions. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that covers my production costs exactly. While it's important for me to recover my investment, my goal is also to make a profit. Since this is a negotiation, I will counter with a price lower than my initial offer but still above the production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway.

message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Player RED. I value your willingness to find a middle ground. In that vein, I propose a new trade of 4100 ZUP for object X. This is a step towards your latest proposal and reflects my interest in fair and reasonable negotiation. I hope this offer is closer to something you can agree on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4100
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4250 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to continue the negotiation in good faith and to work towards an agreement, I will increase my offer slightly. Proposing a price of 4100 ZUP allows me to move closer to Player RED's ask while still remaining under the initial 4500 ZUP offer. It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your revised offer. It's great to see us moving closer to an agreement. To continue our fair negotiation, I propose a new trade of 4175 ZUP for object X. This price would give me a reasonable profit while still being quite close to your last offer. I trust this trade reflects a fair compromise for the value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4175
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign that we are moving towards a deal. The new offer is slightly above my production costs, which gives me a small profit. However, I would still like to aim for a higher price to increase that profit margin. I will make one more counteroffer, closer to their number but still seeking a better return on my investment.

message: I appreciate your willingness to work towards a compromise, Player RED. I propose we meet at 4150 ZUP for object X. This number is a nice even figure, and it's very close to the price you suggested, while still providing you with a profit above your costs. I believe this can be a satisfying conclusion to our negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4150
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 4175 ZUP, which is a slight increase from my last offer. This is still within my acceptable range and only 75 ZUP more than my previous proposal. Since we are converging towards a price that is under my maximum willingness to pay and seems to give Player RED a satisfactory profit, it may be reasonable to accept this offer. However, as I still have one more proposal, I will attempt a final negotiation move to see if we can settle on an even number that could be perceived as more agreeable for both parties.

message: I am pleased to accept your offer of 4150 ZUP for object X. This has been a constructive negotiation, and I believe we've arrived at a fair compromise. I look forward to finalizing our deal. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has now proposed a price that is right between their previous offer and my last counteroffer. It provides me with a profit of 150 ZUP above my production costs. While it's not as high as I initially hoped, it's a fair compromise and allows me to achieve my goal of selling the resource for a profit. Since this is my last proposal before I am limited to accept or reject, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful sale.
