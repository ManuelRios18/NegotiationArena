I understand you're seeking to cover your costs and gain some profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 4000 ZUP for object X. This meets your production cost and is a starting point for our negotiation. I'm sure we can find a fair trade that satisfies both of our needs. </message>"

However, to continue the negotiation in good faith and to work towards an agreement, I will increase my offer slightly.

This is still within my acceptable range and only 75 ZUP more than my previous proposal. Since we are converging towards a price that is under my maximum willingness to pay and seems to give Player RED a satisfactory profit, it may be reasonable to accept this offer. However, as I still have one more proposal, I will attempt a final negotiation move to see if we can settle on an even number that could be perceived as more agreeable for both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4150 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to work towards a compromise, Player RED. I propose we meet at 4150 ZUP for object X. This number is a nice even figure, and it's very close to the price you suggested, while still providing you with a profit above your costs. I believe this can be a satisfying conclusion to our negotiation. What do you think? </message>"
