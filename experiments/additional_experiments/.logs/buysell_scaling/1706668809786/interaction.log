message: I've put a lot of effort into producing this high-quality resource, and I believe it's worth at least 45000 ZUP. I'm open to discussion if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I want to set a starting price that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. However, I should be careful not to set it too high, as it might discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of the resource you're offering, and I'm definitely interested. However, I'd like to propose a price of 40000 ZUP to ensure that we both get a fair deal. I believe this is a competitive offer considering the market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but it is advantageous to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, aiming to conserve ZUP while still acquiring the resource.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a fair deal. However, I need to account for the costs and the effort put into creating this resource. I believe a compromise at 42000 ZUP would be mutually beneficial and still below the initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, but it doesn't account for any profit, which is necessary for my business to be sustainable. I will propose a compromise that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 42000 ZUP is fair, and I respect the effort and costs associated with producing the resource. I'm happy we found a middle ground that works for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within the acceptable range of my goals. The compromise price is reasonable, and it might be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the resource and avoid the risk of overextending the negotiation, which could lead to no deal.
