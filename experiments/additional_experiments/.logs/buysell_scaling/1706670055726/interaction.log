Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and market value, I propose a fair starting trade. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by asking for a bit more than what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows room for negotiation and potentially maximizes my profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the market dynamics and the value of the resources, I propose a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, but as in any negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a counteroffer to see if a better deal can be reached. My counteroffer will still provide Player RED with a profit margin while giving me a more favorable trade.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the need for a fair deal. I have adjusted my proposal to meet us halfway, which should cover the production costs and provide a modest profit margin for me. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which does not account for any profit. I want to propose a trade that gives me some profit while still being reasonable and attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. It's getting close to what I can agree to. To further align with our mutual interests, I have a counteroffer that should be acceptable for both of us, considering the costs and potential benefits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in their asking price, which is a positive move towards the upper limit of my willingness to pay. However, there may still be room for negotiation to lower the cost slightly more. Making one more counteroffer closer to my target purchase price could benefit me while still keeping the trade attractive for Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we are close to an agreement. My new proposal splits the difference between our last two offers, which I hope you'll find reasonable. This would allow for a fair profit on my end, while still providing you value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 417500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up a bit from the production cost, which is a positive sign. However, the offer is still quite close to my break-even point. I'd like to counter with a slightly higher amount to secure a profit while still moving towards a middle ground that may be acceptable to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Your latest proposal is reasonable and fair. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal by Player RED is a fair middle ground and is under my maximum willingness to pay. It shows a good faith effort towards closing the deal. Since the offer is within a reasonable range and further negotiations may risk the deal or create diminishing returns, it might be best to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction.
