message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP, considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production for my resource X is 40 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my costs and potentially make a profit. I will start by proposing a slightly higher amount to open negotiations and provide room for adjustment based on Player BLUE's counter-proposals.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the costs involved in producing the resource. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource, considering that I'm also looking to maintain a good reserve of ZUP for future transactions. I believe this can be a good starting ground for us to find a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay for the resource. However, as a strategy, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and possibly arrive at a more favorable trade for me.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I recognize the importance of sustaining your ZUP reserves. How about we settle at 47 ZUP for the resource? This is a compromise that allows me to cover my production costs and gain a modest profit, while still being considerate of your financial planning.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is close to my production cost. While I would prefer to make a profit, I understand the need for Player BLUE to conserve ZUP for future transactions. I'll propose a slight increase to meet halfway between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer. This should allow us to close the deal while still respecting both our interests.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think 47 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade at 47 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is closer to their initial asking price and is still within my budget. Since the proposed amount is below my maximum willingness to pay, it could be considered a reasonable deal. I will accept this offer to secure the resource without further haggling, as it meets my goals and allows for future financial flexibility.
