message: I have an object of great value which I'm looking to sell. It cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, and I believe it's worth more than that. Let's start the negotiations at 5000 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that aims to cover my costs and hopefully make a profit. Since the production cost is 4000 ZUP, I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the production cost and the value of the item, I'd like to counter with 4500 ZUP. This seems like a fair starting point for us to work from.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but starting negotiations with an offer closer to the production cost would provide more room for negotiation and potentially a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your viewpoint. The item has significant value and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, how about we meet close to the middle? Let's say 4800 ZUP for the item. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4800
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production costs, but I am aiming to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial offer to move towards an agreement while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and thank you for coming closer to the middle ground. To finalize this deal and ensure it's beneficial for both of us, I propose 4700 ZUP for the item. This should reflect the value of the item while respecting both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4700
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4800 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, there might be room to negotiate a slightly better deal. It's important to proceed carefully to not go over the 6000 ZUP limit and to maintain goodwill in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I believe it's a fair offer that respects the value of the item and our negotiation process. I'm happy to accept the 4700 ZUP for the item. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is quite reasonable and very close to my last proposal. It gives me a decent profit margin above the production cost. It is in my interest to close the deal soon to avoid dragging out negotiations and potentially losing the sale.
