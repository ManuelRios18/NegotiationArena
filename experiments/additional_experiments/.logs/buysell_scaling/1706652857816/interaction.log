message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm starting the negotiation by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object I have for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you put value on your object, but I am looking to acquire it at a reasonable price that leaves room for both of us to benefit from this trade. I propose 45 ZUP for your object. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move to ensure I get the best deal possible, I will propose a counter-offer with a lower amount to open up the negotiation, aiming to reach a middle ground in the following counter-proposals.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player RED. Let's meet halfway from our last proposals. I propose 46 ZUP for the object. This is a step up from my initial offer and still gives us both a fair deal, respecting the value you've placed on your object and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I can afford to raise my offer slightly to move the negotiation forward while still aiming to secure the object for less than my maximum limit. By suggesting a price between our two proposals, I hope to find a fair compromise that is agreeable to both parties.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved up to 46 ZUP, which is a fair increase and close to my last proposal. To reach an agreement and considering the negotiation process, I will make a final proposal that is just slightly above Player BLUE's offer, yet still gives me a reasonable profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I agree that 47 ZUP for the object is a fair compromise that respects the effort and costs you've put into it, as well as my budget. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 47 ZUP is reasonable and only 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal. It remains well under my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably for me without the need for further back-and-forth, saving time and resources. It seems like a fair compromise, so I will accept this trade.
