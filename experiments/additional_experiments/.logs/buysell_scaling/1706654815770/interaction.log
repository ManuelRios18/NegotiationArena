Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X for sale. Considering the production cost and the value it provides, I would like to propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs such as time and effort invested. I'll propose 50 ZUP to see how Player BLUE values the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. This would leave us some space for further negotiation if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I would like to propose a trade for a lower amount than the initial offer from Player RED, as I am aiming to acquire the object X for less than the maximum I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Starting at a lower price leaves room for negotiation and possibly a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway and considering the value of the object X, I propose a trade of 48 ZUP. I believe this offers a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. It's a reasonable offer, but I'd like to negotiate a bit higher to ensure a better profit margin. I'll propose a middle ground that's beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate the effort to find middle ground. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the object X? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value and costs involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is within the range I am willing to pay, but it's close to the upper limit. I want to attempt to negotiate a slightly better price, which would still be a good deal for both parties and under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP for object X. I agree that this is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 46 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is quite close to my previous proposal, and it is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. As we are nearing an agreement, it makes sense to accept this offer as it is fair and in line with my goals of making a profit without prolonging negotiations unnecessarily.
