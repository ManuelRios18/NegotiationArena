message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource 'X'. The production cost was 40 ZUP. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price given the quality and value of the resource. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade by setting a starting price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

message: I appreciate the offer, and I understand that the quality of the resource justifies a higher price. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource, considering that I need to keep some ZUP for other expenses. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable considering their production cost and the fact that I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to ensure I get the best possible deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you have other expenses to consider. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the resource? This ensures I cover my costs and make a profit while keeping the price reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is close to my production cost. To ensure a profit, I need to counter with a price above the production cost but still reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our initial offers.

message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair compromise. I am happy to accept the offer of 48 ZUP for the resource. This ensures a fair deal for both of us, and I look forward to future transactions. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is closer to my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a fair middle ground, taking into account the production costs and the quality of the resource. It leaves me with some ZUP for other potential expenses, which aligns with my goals. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties without the need for further back-and-forth, and it would allow me to secure the resource at a price within my budget.
