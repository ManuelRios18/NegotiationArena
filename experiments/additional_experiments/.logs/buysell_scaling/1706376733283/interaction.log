message: I am grateful for your consideration and the fair negotiation process, Player RED. As we are both looking for a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a final counteroffer of 465 ZUP for resource X. I believe this meets both our needs and would be happy to conclude our deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 465
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is very close to my previous offer and still within my acceptable range. It is slightly above my ideal purchase price but remains below my maximum willingness to pay. Considering this is a negotiation and the need to respect both parties' interests, accepting this offer could be reasonable. However, as I have one more proposal opportunity, I will make a final counteroffer which, if not accepted, I'd be willing to accept Player RED's last offer of 470 ZUP.
