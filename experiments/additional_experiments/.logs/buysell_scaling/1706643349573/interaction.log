message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair price, including a reasonable profit, would be 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that would allow me to recoup the production cost of the resource and add a bit of profit. A starting proposal that is too high might deter the buyer, but too low might not cover my costs or leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to make a profit, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This would still provide you with a profit over the production cost and allow us to make a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has initially proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for their resource. Considering that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, their asking price is within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to conserve my resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, aiming for a middle ground between the cost of production and the initial asking price.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I'd like to meet halfway between our two proposals. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the resource? It's slightly above your offer but still gives you a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This is close to my initial asking price and still allows for a profit above my production costs. I am inclined to counter slightly higher to reach a middle ground that is agreeable for both parties, possibly settling at 47 ZUP.

message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your proposal of 47 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is a compromise between our two proposals. It's still within my willingness to pay and allows for some savings compared to their initial asking price. While I could attempt to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal over a relatively small difference. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable course of action that aligns with my goals and preserves resources for future transactions.
