Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object you're offering, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to take into account the market competition and my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as in any negotiation, it's typical to counter-offer with a slightly lower amount to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties. I will propose a trade that is lower than their asking price but still within a reasonable range.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, and I believe we are close to a fair agreement. To finalize our deal, I propose a price of 47 ZUP. This small adjustment ensures a fair trade for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer that is still within my willingness to pay. Meeting halfway is a common compromise in negotiations and the offer of 48 ZUP is close to my initial counter-offer. It might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is closed, but I could attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can secure a slightly better price without jeopardizing the deal.
