message: I have a high-quality resource X that I'm offering. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's open the negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I will propose a trade that allows me to make a profit on the resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose a higher amount to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the resource X you're offering. However, considering my budget constraints and to ensure that we both feel satisfied with the trade, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair counteroffer that takes into account both the quality of the resource and my capacity to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it is the starting point of the negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is willing to go lower, but I will keep it reasonable to maintain a good chance for a successful negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your budget considerations. To meet halfway and finalize our agreement, I propose a reduced trade of 48 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this trade reflects the quality and the costs involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To facilitate a trade and still make a profit, I will counter with a slightly reduced price but still above my production cost. This should also help us reach an agreement more quickly.

Turn: 1
message: I am glad to see we are moving towards a deal that works for both of us. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP in exchange for the resource X. This should cover your production costs while also respecting my budget. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests and we can close the deal with satisfaction on both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP which is closer to my initial counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate on their part. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, 48 ZUP is still within a range I find acceptable. However, I might try for one more counteroffer to see if we can agree on a slightly lower price, which would benefit my resources while still closing in on a deal that respects the value of the resource.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a fair price above my production cost. I want to close the deal while ensuring a reasonable profit. There's been good faith negotiation from both sides, so I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful and amicable trade.
