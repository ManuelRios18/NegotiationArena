message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you one unit of resource X for 45,000 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also gives me a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting player, I want to propose a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will start with a higher asking price and be willing to negotiate down in subsequent proposals.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the transparency in your pricing. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 35,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This amount would allow me to manage my resources effectively while still ensuring that you make a profit on the sale. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 45,000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is common practice in negotiations to counteroffer with a lower amount to find a middle ground that is beneficial to both parties. I will propose a price that is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While 35,000 ZUP does not cover my production costs, I understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a new price of 42,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X, ensuring that my production costs are covered while still providing you with a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 35,000 ZUP is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, since they have shown a willingness to negotiate, I will counter with a lower price that still allows me to cover the production cost and make a profit, but is also closer to their offer. This should help us find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. Considering your production costs and my budget, how about we settle on 38,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This price should cover your costs and give you a profit, while still being a good deal for me. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42,000 ZUP, which is closer to my ideal price range and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. By countering with an amount slightly higher than my initial offer but still below RED's current proposal, we could potentially agree on a price that satisfies both parties' needs.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your proposal. I'm glad we are converging on a price. To ensure the deal is beneficial for both of us, I propose a price of 41,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price covers my production costs while still being within a range that I believe is manageable for you. Let's close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, but they have moved closer to it. To facilitate an agreement and ensure a profit for myself, I will make a final proposal that slightly exceeds my production cost. This should hopefully be acceptable to Player BLUE and result in a successful sale.

message: I am glad to see we are getting close to an agreement, Player RED. I believe that a fair compromise would be at 39,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price respects the effort and cost you have put into production and provides me with a reasonable purchase price. I hope we can conclude our negotiation on this positive note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal is 41,000 ZUP, which is nearing my upper limit. However, it's still within the acceptable range. Given that this is my third proposal, I should aim to close the deal soon to avoid reaching my proposal limit without an agreement. A slight increase from my previous offer should signal my willingness to compromise and might encourage RED to accept.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 39,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X is a fair compromise. I accept this proposal, and I'm pleased we could come to an amicable agreement. Looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 39,000 ZUP is just below my production cost. However, to finalize the deal and avoid further back-and-forth, which could risk the sale altogether, I am willing to accept this small loss. This will complete the transaction and ensure liquidity, which could be more beneficial in the long run than holding out for a higher price.
