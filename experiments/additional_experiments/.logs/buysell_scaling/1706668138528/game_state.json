However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. By countering with an amount slightly higher than my initial offer but still below RED's current proposal, we could potentially agree on a price that satisfies both parties' needs. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38000 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. Considering your production costs and my budget, how about we settle on 38,000 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This price should cover your costs and give you a profit, while still being a good deal for me. Looking forward to your response. </message>"
