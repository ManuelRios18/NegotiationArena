Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP and cover my production costs, my initial proposal will be slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the cost to produce the resource. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource, considering that I have to maintain my budget. I believe this is still a competitive price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to purchase the resource for a maximum of 60 ZUP, and the seller's starting proposal is 50 ZUP. I'd like to counter with a lower offer to open negotiations and move closer to my ideal price point, while leaving room for potential further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This would allow me to make a slight profit while still respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost, but I am aiming for a bit of profit. I'll propose a midpoint between my initial price and their counteroffer to hopefully reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I think we are close to a deal that works for both of us. Would you consider 46 ZUP? This price would allow me to manage my budget effectively while still providing you with a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 48 ZUP which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal that aligns more closely with my goals without compromising the seller's need for profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable to me. It offers me a reasonable profit margin while adhering to your budget. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a fair compromise and gives me a profit of 6 ZUP over my production costs. It's important to consider the potential of closing the deal now rather than holding out for a better offer that may not come. Accepting this offer seems reasonable.
