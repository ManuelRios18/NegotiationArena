message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I will give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a price slightly higher than my production costs to start the negotiation and see what Player BLUE is willing to offer. The initial proposal is meant to leave room for negotiation and compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is still a fair trade for both of us and allows me to maintain more of my resources for future transactions. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range of payment for the resource X, however, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will counter-propose with a lower amount of ZUP, aiming to conserve some of my resources while still making a fair offer.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer, and in the spirit of negotiation, I propose we meet halfway from your offer. How about 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would ensure a fair profit for me and a valuable resource for you at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but slightly less than my initial asking price. I am willing to negotiate but want to aim for a higher price to ensure I make a profit. I will counter with a price that splits the difference, showing my willingness to compromise but still valuing my resource.

message: Player RED, I find your proposal of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X to be a reasonable compromise. I am willing to accept this offer to ensure a fair trade for both of us. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer of 48 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay for the resource X. By accepting this offer, I secure the needed resource while staying below my maximum threshold. This seems like a fair compromise between conserving resources and ensuring the acquisition of X.
