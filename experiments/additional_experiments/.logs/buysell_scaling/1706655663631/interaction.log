message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for 50 ZUP, which includes a reasonable profit margin. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a price that allows me to recover the production costs and also gain a profit. I'll start by setting a higher asking price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I am interested in your offer for the resource X. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This price still ensures you make a profit while also being more in line with my budget. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is within the price range I am willing to pay, but as in any negotiation, it's common to propose a counteroffer to see if we can agree on a better deal. By offering a slightly lower price, I can potentially save some of my resources while still leaving room for Player RED to make a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of 48 ZUP for resource X. This ensures a fair profit for me while considering your budget. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. I want to make a counter-proposal that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their counteroffer to maintain negotiation momentum and come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.

message: I think meeting in the middle is a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for resource X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still within the range that I am willing to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common compromise in negotiations, and this price is close to my initial counteroffer. It would be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through, as it is only 3 ZUP more than my counteroffer and well within my maximum willingness to pay.
