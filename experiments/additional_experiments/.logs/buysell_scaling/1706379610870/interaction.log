Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my valuable object which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I believe it's worth more than the production cost due to its value, so I'm starting the bidding at 5000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the initial proposal and considering the production cost of the object, I will set the price slightly higher to start negotiations and see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, and while it's reasonable, I'd like to propose a starting offer of 4500 ZUP. This leaves us room to negotiate and find a middle ground that respects both the production cost and the object's value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the object for 5000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation and leave room for potential counteroffers.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I propose we settle at 4750 ZUP. This price recognizes both the production costs and the additional value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4750
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it's still above the production cost. I will counter-propose with a value higher than the offered amount but still less than my initial proposal to move the negotiation forward.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 4750 ZUP is a fair middle ground that recognizes the value of your object. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 4750 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still within a range that is acceptable. I will accept this offer as it is a fair price and concludes the negotiation efficiently without protracted back-and-forth.
