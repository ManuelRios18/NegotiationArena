message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Given the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting point that covers my production costs plus a margin for profit. I am proposing a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for object X at 50 ZUP. Considering market conditions and my budget, I propose a trade where I give 45 ZUP for the object. This leaves us some room for further negotiation if needed. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it would be prudent to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 45 ZUP. I understand the need to find a middle ground, so how about we settle at 48 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and provide a fair profit margin, while also taking into consideration the value of object X to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs. Considering the goal is to make a profit, I am willing to negotiate but would like to propose a compromise closer to my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of covering your costs. While 48 ZUP is a fair counter-offer, I would like to propose 47 ZUP for object X. This price respects your production costs and offers a reasonable profit, while also aligning with my budget constraints. I hope this meets your approval for a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-proposal of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is closer to the initial asking price and suggests a willingness to negotiate. I believe there is still room to propose a value that's beneficial for both of us, slightly increasing my previous offer without reaching the maximum I am willing to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 47 ZUP for object X is accepted. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, respecting both my production costs and your budget constraints. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate and respect my production costs. Their offer of 47 ZUP is close to my last proposed price and offers a reasonable profit. To maintain goodwill and close the deal, I am inclined to accept this offer, as it satisfies my goal of selling above production cost.
