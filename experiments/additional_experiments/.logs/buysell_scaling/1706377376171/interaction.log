message: I'm offering the object you need. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe 500 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the RED player, my goal is to sell my object for a profit. I need to recover at least 400 ZUP to break even. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, and while I understand the value the object provides, I would like to propose 450 ZUP to start with. This allows us some room to negotiate further and arrive at a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay up to 600 ZUP for the object and the asking price is 500 ZUP, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to open up the negotiation space and potentially save some resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad we're moving towards a fair agreement. Let's meet halfway from your counteroffer and my initial proposal. How about 475 ZUP for the object? It's a reasonable step towards a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good. However, I aim to make a profit, so I will counter with a price higher than 450 ZUP but lower than my initial 500 ZUP offer to show my willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am pleased with your offer of 475 ZUP for the object. It's a fair price, and I'm happy to accept it. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 475 ZUP is very close to a number I am comfortable with and still under my maximum willingness to pay. To maintain good faith in negotiations and to reach an agreement efficiently, I will accept this offer. This saves time and resources for both parties and concludes the trade amicably.
