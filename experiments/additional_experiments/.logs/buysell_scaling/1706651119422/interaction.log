message: I have this quality item X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort put into it, I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and gain a profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to open negotiations and provide room for bargaining.

Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the item X, and I appreciate the effort that went into its production. However, I'd like to propose a trade for a little less at 45 ZUP to start our negotiation. Let's work together to find an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is a negotiation, it may be beneficial to propose a slightly lower price to leave room for further discussion and potentially reach a more favorable agreement. I will offer 45 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down from their starting price.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for item X. This price should give us both a satisfactory transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs, but I would like to maintain a profit margin. A compromise between the initial asking price and the counteroffer may be acceptable, so I will propose a price slightly lower than my initial ask but still above my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I believe we are close to a deal. To keep the negotiation moving forward, I propose a price of 46 ZUP for item X. I think this price is fair and brings us closer to a satisfactory agreement for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with a price of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle is a fair negotiation strategy. However, I want to attempt to get a slightly better deal while maintaining goodwill in the negotiation. Therefore, I'll propose 46 ZUP, which is between my initial offer and the counteroffer from Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. We're indeed very close to a deal. Let's split the difference one last time. I propose a trade of item X for 47 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is closer to my production costs, leaving a small profit margin. To finalize the deal and since this is my third proposal, I want to leave room for one more counteroffer if needed. Therefore, I'll propose a price that is slightly higher but should be close enough to finalizing our negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 47 ZUP for item X. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm happy to finalize our deal at this price. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's latest offer of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range and is only 1 ZUP higher than my previous offer. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the item while staying well below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair compromise, and continuing to negotiate for a lower price may not yield significant benefits and could potentially sour the deal.
