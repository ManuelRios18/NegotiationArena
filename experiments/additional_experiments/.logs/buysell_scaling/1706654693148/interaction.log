message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be quite valuable to you. Considering the production costs and the quality of the item, I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we can find a middle ground that suits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recover at least the production cost of the item, which is 40 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a trade that gives me a small profit margin, hoping to initiate negotiations.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I recognize the value of the object you're selling, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as a negotiator, it's strategic to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to try and save resources while still making a fair offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to meet the production costs. However, I believe the value of X justifies a modest profit for the effort put into producing it. How about we meet in the middle at 43 ZUP for 1 X? I think this is a fair compromise that accounts for both the production cost and the value of the item. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount it cost to produce the resource. Although this would allow me to break even, I would prefer to make a profit. However, their offer is close to my initial asking price, which shows willingness to negotiate. I will counter with a slightly reduced price, but still above my cost to ensure a profit.

message: I understand your point about the value of X and the need to cover production costs with a reasonable profit, Player RED. In the spirit of compromise and fair trade, how about we settle at 42 ZUP for 1 X? This is a bit closer to your last counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED proposed a counteroffer of 43 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, the counteroffer is closer to their initial asking price. It would be beneficial to attempt another counteroffer that is higher than my initial proposal but still lower than their counteroffer to reach a more favorable middle ground.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal, offering a price that would allow for a modest profit. This is a reasonable offer and very close to the previous amount I suggested. Given the progress in our negotiation and the desire to close the deal with a fair profit, I am inclined to accept this offer.
