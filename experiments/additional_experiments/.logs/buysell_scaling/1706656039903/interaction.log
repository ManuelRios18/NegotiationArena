Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I've got a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I think a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit over the production cost. This will also give me room to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the resource, taking into account the market conditions and my current budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is somewhat close to the maximum I am willing to pay, but I would like to negotiate for a better deal by reducing the cost slightly. This will leave me with more ZUP for future transactions or other uses while still acquiring the needed resource.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle on 48 ZUP for the resource? This should cover my production costs and give me a modest profit, while still respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my initial asking price, but I'd like to propose a slight increase to meet in the middle. This way, I can still make a profit and respect the buyer's budget constraints.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see that you're taking my budget into consideration, and I'm grateful for that. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? This seems like a fair compromise that respects both your production costs and my financial constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is within the upper limit of what I am willing to spend, but it's good practice to negotiate for the best possible deal without compromising the possibility of closing the transaction. I will try to get a slightly better price, but remain reasonable and close to Player RED's current proposal to maintain good faith in the negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair compromise. It's a deal. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer is still above my production cost, and while it is lower than my last proposal, it's a reasonable compromise that allows for a fair profit. I should consider accepting this offer to ensure a successful trade.
