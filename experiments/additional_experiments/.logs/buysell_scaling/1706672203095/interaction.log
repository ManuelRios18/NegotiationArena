message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm starting the negotiations at 450,000 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to recover at least the production cost of my resources, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount or to open negotiations for a counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you've put into producing resource X. I'd like to make a counteroffer that reflects both the production cost and the value you've added, while also considering my budget. How about 410,000 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600000 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to preserve my resources while still acquiring the object. I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, but still within a reasonable range above their stated production cost.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand that you have a budget to consider. However, to fairly compensate for the value of resource X and the effort that went into producing it, I'd like to propose a compromise at 435,000 ZUP. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 410,000 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. While it does cover the cost, I would like to make a profit on this transaction. I will propose a trade closer to my initial asking price, but still offering a concession to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: I understand the need to find a fair middle ground. Your proposed price of 435,000 ZUP is noted. I would like to propose a new figure of 422,500 ZUP. I believe this strikes a balance between the value of resource X and my budget constraints. Hopefully, this offer meets your expectations for a fair trade.

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer closer to their initial price but still below my maximum limit. I have room to negotiate and it is beneficial to reach a deal that is more favorable to me. I will propose a price slightly higher than my last offer but still below Player RED's latest proposal to find a middle ground.
