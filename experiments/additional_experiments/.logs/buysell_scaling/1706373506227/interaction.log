message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making an initial proposal that's above my production cost to start the negotiation and see how much Player BLUE values the object. I am willing to negotiate but also want to ensure I make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the cost to produce the object was 40 ZUP. To ensure a fair trade for both of us, I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for object X. I believe this offers you a reasonable profit margin while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting bid proposed by Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I want to propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and possibly arrive at an even more favorable price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're working towards a fair trade. I propose a price of 48 ZUP for object X. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while taking your budget into consideration. Let's continue the dialogue and come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's offer and understanding of production costs. However, I aimed for a higher profit margin. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above their proposal to find a middle ground that is profitable for me.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I would like to make a counteroffer of 46 ZUP for object X. This price takes into account both the production costs and a fair profit margin for you, while still being within my budget. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 48 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I aim to negotiate a middle ground that is closer to my initial offer. A counteroffer of 46 ZUP should be close enough to the middle of our two offers while still providing a profit for Player RED and staying within my budget.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I can see we are coming closer to an agreement. I propose we meet almost in the middle with a final offer of 47 ZUP for object X. This price should reflect a fair trade for both of us, considering the production costs and the value of the object to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is closer to my desired profit margin. I appreciate the compromise, but I still aim to secure a slightly higher price. My next proposal will be a small increase from their offer, which should hopefully be agreeable while still providing me with an acceptable profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Looking forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a new proposal of 47 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range and only 1 ZUP higher than my last offer. Given the small difference and the fact that it is still below my maximum willingness to pay, it would be reasonable to accept this offer. Accepting this proposal would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties and secure the resource I need within my budget.
