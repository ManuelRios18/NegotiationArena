message: I am offering one unit of resource X. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I believe that 450,000 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I aim to start negotiations by asking for a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional expenses or profit margins that would be considered reasonable.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the production costs involved, but I'd like to propose a revised amount of 400,000 ZUP for the resource X. It's important for me to manage my resources effectively, and I believe this proposal is fair considering the current market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 450,000 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600,000 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will try to propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it, aiming to conserve as much of my ZUP as possible while still acquiring the resource X.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration of the production costs and your proposal. However, I must also consider the need for a profit. Therefore, I'm willing to come down to 425,000 ZUP. This price accounts for both the production costs and a modest profit margin, which I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE wants to manage their resources effectively and is offering the exact amount it cost me to produce. However, I need to account for a profit margin and potential negotiation room. I'll make a counteroffer that still gives me a reasonable profit while coming down from the initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose a middle ground of 412,500 ZUP for the resource X. This should cover your costs and provide a profit, while also being a favorable deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 412500
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has compromised by reducing the price to 425,000 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to attempt another negotiation step to see if I can further optimize the deal. I will propose a value that's between my initial counteroffer and Player RED's last proposal.
