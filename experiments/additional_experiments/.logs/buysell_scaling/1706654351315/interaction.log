message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. I'm looking for 50 ZUP in exchange to cover my costs and to ensure a fair profit margin. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my investment and possibly make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a fair profit margin, but would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for the resource X? It's closer to my budget, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate for a better deal to save ZUP for potential future transactions. I'll propose a slightly lower price that is still within a reasonable range and see if Player RED is willing to compromise.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering the quality of resource X and the production costs involved, would you agree to meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. It is a reasonable offer, but I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer. This strategy allows me to potentially achieve a better profit while still moving towards an agreeable deal.

message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. I see that we are getting close to an agreement. To continue with the spirit of compromise, how about we settle at 46 ZUP for resource X? This is a step up from my previous offer and still provides you with a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial counteroffer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, I still have some room to negotiate for an even better price without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a slightly lower price, but one that is higher than my last offer to show that I am also willing to compromise.

This will conclude the trade quickly and to mutual satisfaction, without further haggling that could risk the deal.
