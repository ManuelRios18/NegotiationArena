message: I think a fair starting point for the trade would be for 45 ZUP. This covers my production costs and gives me a small profit for my efforts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell the object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit. However, I must be careful not to set the price too high initially, as it might discourage Player BLUE from buying. A reasonable starting proposal could be slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to counter with 40 ZUP. This amount still provides you with a profit and ensures a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as a strategic move and to ensure a better deal, I should counter with a slightly lower offer, showing willingness to negotiate but also seeking a more favorable trade. I will propose 40 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to come down a bit, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I make no profit. To make this deal worthwhile for both of us, I propose a trade for 42 ZUP. This allows me to gain a minimal profit while still keeping the price fair for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is exactly at my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. It is in my interest to negotiate a higher price to ensure I get some return on my investment. Since Player BLUE is willing to meet my costs, they may be willing to pay a small premium for the object. I will propose a price that gives me a modest profit while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. To meet halfway and finalize our negotiation, I propose 41 ZUP. This should cover your costs and still provide a profit, while also maintaining fairness for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is still within my budget and close to the initial counteroffer I made. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, accepting this offer would be reasonable, but I could attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, perhaps at 41 ZUP. This would still respect RED's need for profit while optimizing the cost for me.

message: I accept your offer of 41 ZUP. This ensures a fair trade for both of us. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that splits the difference between our previous positions. It provides me with a slight profit, which meets my goal of not selling at cost. Since we are close to an agreement, it seems practical to accept this offer to ensure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation which could lead to a stalemate or decline in the offered amount.
