message: Hello BLUE, I am willing to sell you my resource X. I've taken into account production costs and market value, so I propose a fair price of 45 ZUP for it. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the RED player, my goal is to sell the resource X for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost to open negotiations and see how the BLUE player responds.

message: Hello RED, thank you for the offer. I'm considering the market conditions and the value of the resource, and I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 40 ZUP for it. I believe this is a competitive counteroffer that takes into account both our interests. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as in any negotiation, it may be beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping the counteroffer reasonable and attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean no profit for me considering the production costs. I believe a fair middle ground would be at 42 ZUP. This allows for a small profit on my end while still being a reasonable price for you. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The BLUE player has offered exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure I gain from this trade. However, I should propose a price that isn't too high to avoid discouraging the BLUE player. Meeting halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer could be a good compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, RED. The offer of 42 ZUP seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession from their initial price, coming down to 42 ZUP. This is still within my budget and willingness to pay. It's a small increment from my previous offer and ensures that RED makes a profit, which could facilitate a successful trade. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource at a price that's still below my maximum limit.
