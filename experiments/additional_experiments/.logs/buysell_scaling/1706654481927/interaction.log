message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe there's some room for negotiation here. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for the object X? It's a competitive price that takes into account market conditions and still offers you a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial offer of 45 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as it is a negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. I will start by proposing a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to seek a better deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, selling at cost doesn't leave any margin for profit. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about 42 ZUP for object X? This price gives me a minimal profit and should still be acceptable for you considering the value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the object X at the cost price of 40 ZUP. While this covers my costs, it does not provide any profit. I want to counter-propose with a price that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. I understand your need for a profit margin. To continue our good-faith negotiation, I propose a price of 41 ZUP for object X. This adjustment reflects both our interests in achieving a fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering the asking price to 42 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, I would like to attempt to further reduce the price while keeping the negotiation amicable and moving towards a mutually acceptable agreement. I will propose an amount slightly higher than my initial offer to show willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that it's important for both sides to feel that the transaction is fair. I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up by 1 ZUP to 41 ZUP, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This offer provides me with a small profit of 1 ZUP, which is lower than my previous counter but still acceptable. Considering the negotiation process and the willingness of Player BLUE to close the deal, it may be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of ending up without any profit at all.
