message: I understand your costs and the need for profit. I'm willing to pay a fair price but would like to propose 42000 ZUP for the resource. This still gives you a profit of 2000 ZUP above your production costs. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45000 ZUP for the resource, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as a negotiating tactic, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping the offer fair and above their cost of production.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your desire to find a middle ground. While 42000 ZUP is a fair offer, I would like to propose 43500 ZUP. This splits the difference between our initial proposals, ensuring a profit for me while still being reasonable for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is below my initial asking price, but it does cover my production costs and gives me a profit. However, I want to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my earnings. I'm proposing a number that splits the difference between our two offers.

message: I see your point and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can come up to 43000 ZUP. This offer is respectful of your production costs and desire for profit, while also being a good deal for both of us. Let's close the deal at this fair price.

my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43500 ZUP, which is still within my budget. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly increased amount from my last offer, aiming to secure a deal that is closer to their initial ask but still advantageous for me.
