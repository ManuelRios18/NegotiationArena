message: Hello BLUE, I'm offering you the object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade, so I propose a price of 50 ZUP for it. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by offering the object for a price that would give me a profit over the production cost. I'll propose a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello RED, I appreciate the offer. I understand your costs and desire for a fair trade. I'm willing to buy the object X, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This should still give you a profit and make the trade worthwhile for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is within my budget, but it's always good to negotiate to try and get a better deal. I will counter with a lower offer to see if RED is willing to come down on the price, but I will keep it reasonable to encourage further negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, BLUE. I understand your position and I'm willing to come down on the price, but I would like to propose a compromise at 48 ZUP. This gives us both a fair deal, with a reasonable profit for me. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price but still provides a profit over the production cost. Since this is a negotiation, I should counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle, but still above the production cost to maintain profitability.

message: Thanks for the compromise RED. I'm glad we're making progress. How about we meet almost in the middle? I propose 47 ZUP for the object X. This still ensures you a decent profit and I get a fair price as well. I hope this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has made a compromise which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but there might still be room for a slightly better price. I will propose a price in the middle of our last offers to try and close the deal with a price that is advantageous for both of us.

message: Thank you for the offer, BLUE. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your proposal. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is only 1 ZUP below my last proposal. It's a fair price and very close to the compromise I suggested. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick sale and a profit of 7 ZUP, which is reasonable. It's important to consider the value of closing the deal efficiently without prolonged negotiation.
