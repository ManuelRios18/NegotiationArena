message: I have a high-quality resource X available, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and my costs, I propose a trade for 450 ZUP. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resource which costed me 400 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will be slightly higher to allow room for negotiation. I will propose a trade of 450 ZUP to start the negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will want to negotiate for a lower price.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your resource X and understand your production costs. However, I'd like to propose a trade for 400 ZUP to align with my budget constraints and current market conditions. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, I would like to start the negotiation by offering a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and possibly secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and the need to find a fair price. To meet halfway, I can lower my asking price to 425 ZUP, which allows me to cover my costs and provides you with the resource you need. Let's come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. Since negotiations typically meet in the middle, I will counter-propose with an amount that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable. I'll reduce my initial ask to 425 ZUP, splitting the difference between my original proposal and Player BLUE's offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose increasing my offer to 410 ZUP, which is closer to your adjusted asking price and still within my budget. I believe this offer is fair for both of us, considering the market value and your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, but it's still higher than my initial offer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my first offer but still below their new asking price to continue negotiations and move closer to an agreement that is economical for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your updated offer. I would be willing to go down to 420 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit while respecting your budget limitations. This should be a good balance between our positions and allow us to finalize the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still only 10 ZUP above my production cost. I want to secure a better profit margin. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim for a compromise that is more favorable to me but also likely to be accepted by Player BLUE. I believe an offer of 420 ZUP would be a fair middle ground, providing me with a profit while remaining considerate of Player BLUE's budget.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. My final proposal is 415 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of your resource and my financial considerations. Let's close the deal at this price and benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing flexibility by continuously lowering their asking price. I will make one last proposal before I reach my limit of four proposals. I'll aim to settle on a price that's between my last offer and Player RED's latest proposal, to strive for a final agreement that is still within my budget.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal of 415 ZUP. It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close this deal. I look forward to future opportunities for us to do business together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's final proposal is a compromise that offers me a 15 ZUP profit. While my target was higher, the negotiation appears to have reached its limit, and securing a small profit is better than a stalemate or potential loss. By accepting this offer, I can ensure a sale and potentially build a relationship for future trades. Since this is my final proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I will choose to accept the offer.
