The proposed price of 435,000 ZUP is closer to the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay but still within a reasonable range. To continue the negotiation in good faith and to reach a compromise, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counteroffer, yet still below Player RED's last price.
