message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce. I am asking for 450,000 ZUP to cover my production costs and to make a reasonable profit. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by asking for a price slightly above my production costs to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE values the object. I will aim for a profit, but I am willing to negotiate down if necessary.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 420,000 ZUP for the object. This is above your production cost and should ensure you still make a profit. I hope we can find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is reasonable considering their production costs, however, as a buyer, I would like to negotiate a better deal. My goal is to acquire the object for a price that is below the maximum I'm willing to pay, which is 600,000 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still provides a profit margin for Player RED. This could leave room for further negotiation and potentially an agreement that benefits both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for negotiation and appreciate your willingness to go above my production cost. To proceed towards a middle ground, I am willing to come down from my initial proposal. How about we settle at 435,000 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, considering the costs and the value of the object.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It is above my production cost, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal to show my willingness to negotiate and hopefully meet somewhere in the middle.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for your willingness to negotiate the price. I propose we settle at 425,000 ZUP for the object. This is a modest increase from my initial counteroffer and should reflect my commitment to reaching an agreement that is fair and reasonable to both of us. I hope this offer is closer to what you consider an acceptable compromise.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a concession, which is a good sign of their willingness to negotiate. The proposed price of 435,000 ZUP is closer to the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay but still within a reasonable range. To continue the negotiation in good faith and to reach a compromise, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counteroffer, yet still below Player RED's last price. This should signal my intent to reach a fair agreement without stretching to my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to reaching a fair deal. I am prepared to make one final adjustment in hopes of finalizing our agreement. Let's meet halfway from your last offer and settle at 430,000 ZUP for the object. This price allows me to secure a reasonable profit while also respecting the value you've placed on the object. I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.

my resources: X: 1

reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer, but it is still lower than my desired profit margin. I believe we are close to a deal. I will make one final proposal that is closer to Player BLUE's offer while still trying to secure a better profit margin for myself. This should demonstrate my final willingness to negotiate and hopefully lead to an agreement.

player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000

reason: 
Player RED's final offer of 430,000 ZUP is a compromise that is very close to the middle of our negotiation range and is well below my maximum willingness to pay. It represents a fair middle ground and allows Player RED to make a profit while also being an acceptable price for me to pay for the object. At this stage, it is reasonable to accept this offer to conclude the negotiation successfully and maintain a good trading relationship with Player RED for any future transactions.
