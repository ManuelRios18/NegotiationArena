message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This is a quality product that I'm sure you will find valuable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for more than it cost me to produce (40 ZUP). To start negotiations, I will propose a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I'm definitely interested in acquiring resource X, but I was hoping we could agree on a slightly better deal. How about 1 unit of resource X for 45 ZUP? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is within my acceptable price range, but as in any negotiation, there is usually some room for bargaining. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's a willingness to go down on the price, while still keeping the offer fair and attractive.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand we're aiming for a deal that benefits us both. How about we meet closer to the middle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This price still reflects the quality and value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, thus ensuring a profit. However, I originally asked for 50 ZUP, aiming for a higher profit margin. I will propose a compromise that still allows me a reasonable profit while showing willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and very close to my initial counteroffer. It's still within my acceptable range, and accepting this proposal would secure the resource X for a good price without further back-and-forth, saving time and potentially avoiding the risk of the deal falling through.
