message: I have an excellent quality object ready for you. Considering the cost and the quality, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting offer. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I need to make an initial proposal to start the negotiation. Since my production cost is 40 ZUP, I would like to make a profit. However, I should also consider that setting a price too high might deter the buyer. A starting proposal slightly above my cost could be a good starting point for negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and I'm interested in the object. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to account for my budget constraints and to ensure a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but as a negotiation tactic, I will propose a slightly lower price to leave room for further negotiation and potentially arrive at a more favorable outcome. This counteroffer also helps to establish my interest in the object without immediately agreeing to the first offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your budget considerations, and I'm willing to come down a bit on the price. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would cover my costs and allow for a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost and would still give me a profit, but it's less than my initial asking price. I may want to counter with a price that meets halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer to continue the negotiation and aim for a price that's favorable to me but also acceptable to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. To reach a fair middle ground, I propose 46 ZUP for the object. This price should cover your costs while respecting my budgetary limits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering the price. The offer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget and is closer to the initial offer, making it a fair compromise. However, I believe there may be room for one more small adjustment in price that could benefit both parties before finalizing the deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I value our negotiation and would like to propose a final price of 47 ZUP. This price gives us both a fair deal, ensuring I cover my costs with a modest profit and you stay within your budget. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is willing to negotiate but has proposed a price that is still below my last offer. I have room for one more proposal before I can only accept or reject. I want to propose a price that is closer to my last offer but still gives the buyer a sense of gaining ground in the negotiation. By proposing 47 ZUP, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price that's satisfactory to me.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the final price of 47 ZUP. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the negotiation, I believe we've reached a fair agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a good faith effort to accommodate my budget, and the proposed price of 47 ZUP is reasonable, only slightly above my last offer. It's close to the max I am willing to pay, and accepting this offer would allow us to close the deal amicably and efficiently, without risking the negotiation falling through over a small difference. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this final offer.
