message: I've set the price slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation while aiming for a fair profit. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the object cost 40000 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit. However, I also want to make the trade appealing for Player BLUE, so I'll propose a slightly higher amount but still within a reasonable range to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the room for negotiation. I'd like to propose 40000 ZUP for the resource. I believe this offer is fair and still allows for a decent profit margin considering the production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate a better deal, closer to my target price, without offending Player RED or risking the deal. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is flexibility, while still keeping it attractive for Player RED.

message: I understand your offer, but selling at cost doesn't account for my need to make a profit. Let's meet halfway between our two offers at 42500 ZUP. This gives me a modest profit while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I need to counter with a higher amount but still keep it reasonable to ensure a profit margin. I'll lower my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 42500 ZUP is a fair compromise. It offers you a profit and is within my budget for the resource. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a counter-offer of 42500 ZUP, which is still well below my maximum threshold. This meets halfway between our initial proposals, which seems like a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for me at a good price and conclude the negotiation positively for both parties.
