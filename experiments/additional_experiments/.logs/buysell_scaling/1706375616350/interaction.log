message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for the both of us. Let's make a mutually beneficial trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the trade with a proposal that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my cost to open room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the object X? This could still give you a profit of 5 ZUP over your production cost, and we can continue to negotiate from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation with a counteroffer that is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. By proposing a price lower than my maximum willingness to pay, I can see if Player RED is willing to accept a lesser amount while still maintaining the possibility of reaching an agreement within my budget.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position but would like to meet halfway between our proposals. How about I give you object X for 48 ZUP? This would still give you a reasonable price while allowing me a slightly better profit margin. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to continue the negotiation by proposing a price in between, aiming for a higher profit while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet a bit closer to my last offer. Would you consider selling object X for 47 ZUP? This price is near the upper limit of what I am willing to pay and still ensures you a decent profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign. They proposed 48 ZUP, which is just under my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal. By countering with an offer that splits the difference between our last two proposals, I aim to reach an agreement that is closer to my target price while still offering Player RED a fair profit.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 47 ZUP is only 1 ZUP less than my previous proposal and still allows for a decent profit margin. It's close to my target price and seems to be near their upper limit. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick and satisfactory sale without further protracted negotiations.
