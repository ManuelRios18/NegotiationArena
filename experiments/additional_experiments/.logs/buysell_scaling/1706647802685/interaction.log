Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of finding a fair trade for both of us. I've invested 40 ZUP in producing the object. Considering the effort and resources invested, I propose a trade where you give 45 ZUP for my object. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that would allow me to make a small profit over the production costs, to open negotiations and gauge the buyer's willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer and the effort you've put into producing the object. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price that fits within my budget while still acknowledging the value of your work. How does 40 ZUP sound for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my maximum willing price of 60 ZUP. However, it is common to negotiate the price down in a trading game, so I will attempt to propose a lower amount that is still fair and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet my production costs. However, I'm looking to make at least a small profit for my investment. Would you consider a compromise at 42 ZUP for the object? It's a slight increase from your offer but still reasonable and allows me a modest return on my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but doesn't provide any profit. I would like to make at least a small profit, so I'll propose a price in between the initial and counteroffer, allowing room for negotiation while aiming for a fair trade.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 42 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. It allows you a profit and respects my budget constraints. Let's proceed with the trade at 42 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 42 ZUP, which is only a 2 ZUP increase from my previous offer and well within my budget. This proposal still allows me to save ZUP for other potential needs and is below the maximum I am willing to pay. It seems like a fair compromise that allows Player RED to make a profit while staying within my spending goals.
