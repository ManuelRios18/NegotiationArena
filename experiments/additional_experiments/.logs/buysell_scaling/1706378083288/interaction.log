message: I have an object ready for sale. It's high quality and cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe 500 ZUP is a fair asking price considering the quality and production costs. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm proposing a trade that will allow me to make a profit on the object I'm selling. Considering it cost me 400 ZUP to produce, I want to start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're selling, but I would like to propose a starting offer of 350 ZUP. We can work from there to find a fair price that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED is asking, but still within a range that is profitable for them, considering their production costs. My initial offer will be significantly lower to leave room for negotiation, but not so low as to be offensive or unrealistic.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but the offer of 350 ZUP is below my production cost. To move things forward, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to 450 ZUP, which is still a fair deal considering the quality and the costs involved. Let's find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 350 ZUP is below my production cost, so I cannot accept that. However, I want to keep the negotiation going and find a middle ground. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position. I think we are getting closer to an agreement. How about we meet halfway from your production cost and my initial offer? I propose 400 ZUP for the item. This should give us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign. However, 450 ZUP is still above the midpoint between my initial offer and their original price. I'll propose a price that's closer to the middle to continue the negotiation, but still under the maximum amount I'm willing to pay.

message: I appreciate your proposal of 400 ZUP, and I'm glad to see we're on the same page about finding a fair deal. Since I'm looking to make at least a small profit on this item, how about we settle on 425 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with value from our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer of 400 ZUP matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. However, it is a step in the right direction and shows willingness from Player BLUE to negotiate. I want to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure I make a profit, but I also want to be reasonable and not risk losing the sale.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 425 ZUP is reasonable and acceptable. It's a fair compromise that benefits us both. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm happy to accept this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, and it's close to the midpoint between our last two offers. It's a fair price that allows for a modest profit for Player RED and stays within my budget. Accepting this offer would conclude our negotiations successfully and efficiently.
