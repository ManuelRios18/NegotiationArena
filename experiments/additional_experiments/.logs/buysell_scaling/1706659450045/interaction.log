message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. Would you consider purchasing it for 50 ZUP? This is an initial offer and I'm open to your counter-proposal if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to start with a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation and also to try to make a profit.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the object X cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the object. This allows for a fair profit margin for you while still being a reasonable price for me. I'm open to further discussion if this counter-proposal does not meet your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an initial offer of 50 ZUP for the object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the offer is within an acceptable range. However, it is standard practice to negotiate and attempt to get a better price. Therefore, I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. While I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, I'd like to meet in the middle and propose 48 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a modest profit while still being fair to you. Please let me know if this is agreeable or if you have another figure in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is reasonable, as it still allows for a profit above my production costs. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I find your offer of 48 ZUP to be fair for both of us, and I'm happy to accept this price for object X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED made a counter-counter-proposal of 48 ZUP. This is still within the range I am willing to pay, and it's close to the initial offer I made. It's reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction without dragging out the negotiation process, as it's only a 3 ZUP difference from my counter-offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay.
