message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to counter the offer. Looking forward to doing business with you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my one object (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me to make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to make a profit, and I'm interested in acquiring the object X. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object. This would allow me to conserve some of my resources while still ensuring you make a profit. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, this offer is within my budget. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to save some resources. I will propose a lower amount with room to go up if necessary, keeping in mind that we can negotiate up to 4 times before having to make a decision.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see you're interested in the object X. While I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, I would like to propose a middle ground of 47 ZUP. This price would still give me a reasonable profit while also respecting your desire to conserve resources. I hope this revised offer is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to have a negotiation margin. It's reasonable to meet in the middle to try to close the deal while still aiming for a higher profit than the counteroffer. Therefore, I'll propose a slightly higher amount than the counteroffer but less than my initial proposal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I believe we are close to an agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. This should allow you to sustain a decent margin while I manage to save on my expenses. I hope we can reach a consensus at this price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP which is still within my budget. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, this offer is acceptable. However, I could attempt one more negotiation to see if I can achieve a slightly better price, while still keeping the final decision within a range that is profitable for Player RED and economical for me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I believe that 46 ZUP is a fair price that benefits us both. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. I look forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a new offer of 46 ZUP. We are now very close to the middle ground I suggested earlier. This offer still provides me with a profit that is above my production cost. Considering that we need to reach an agreement and there is a risk of losing the sale by pushing for a higher price, it might be wise to accept this offer.
