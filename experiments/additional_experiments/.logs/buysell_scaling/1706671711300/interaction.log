message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be valuable to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I would like to propose a starting trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 450,000 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a profit but also leaves room for negotiation, taking into account the cost of production.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object and your production costs. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 400,000 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the resource while allowing us to reach a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save resources while still working towards a price that Player RED might find acceptable. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than the middle point between the starting proposal and my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to engage in a fair negotiation. To meet halfway and considering my need to cover production costs and make a reasonable profit, I propose a new trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 425,000 ZUP. I believe this revised offer is a compromise that reflects the value of the resource and allows for a fair profit. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, which means I would not make a profit. I want to counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my production costs to ensure a profit.

message: Thank you for understanding and for the revised offer, Player RED. I am glad we are moving towards an agreement. To continue in the spirit of fair negotiation, I would like to propose a new trade where I give you 410,000 ZUP for one unit of X. This amount reflects a fair increase from my previous offer and takes us closer to your asking price. I hope this offer is acceptable to you as it is closer to the midpoint of our negotiation range.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425,000 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a good sign and shows willingness to reach a deal. Since there's still some room to negotiate and to ensure I am getting the best possible deal, I will make a slight increase in my offer, bringing it closer to the amount Player RED has proposed but still below it, to maintain the negotiation momentum.

message: Player BLUE, I am pleased to see that we are converging towards an agreement. In the spirit of compromise and to finalize our negotiation, I propose a new trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 417,500 ZUP. This price reflects a fair balance between our positions and allows both of us to benefit from the deal. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal on these terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 417500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step. However, the offer is still very close to my cost of production. To reach a fair deal, I want to propose a price that is slightly lower than my previous offer but still allows me a reasonable profit margin. I will aim for a value that is close to the midpoint between our last two offers.

message: Player RED, I agree that your offer of 417,500 ZUP strikes a fair balance and I am pleased with the terms of this deal. I accept your proposal and look forward to finalizing our agreement. Thank you for the productive and fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 417,500 ZUP is well within my budget and close to the midpoint between our previous offers. While I could attempt to negotiate further, the difference in ZUP is now relatively small compared to my remaining budget and the maximum I am willing to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation for me and would secure the resource I need without further back-and-forth, which also conserves negotiation capital for potential future interactions.
