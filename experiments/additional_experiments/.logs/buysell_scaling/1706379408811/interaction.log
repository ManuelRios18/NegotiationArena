player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you've placed on your resource. I'd like to make a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP, considering the production costs and the potential for a beneficial trade for both of us. I hope this is an acceptable middle ground for us to start on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate to try to obtain a better deal, especially since there is a considerable margin between the asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the cost of production to see if the seller is willing to negotiate down.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're aligning on the value of the resource. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial asking price at 4350 ZUP? I believe this price fairly reflects the resource's worth and provides a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. They have recognized the production costs and are willing to pay above that, which is a good sign. However, I want to aim for a higher price to maximize my profit while still making it a reasonable trade for Player BLUE. I'll propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer to move closer to an agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's settle at 4300 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the resource's value and respecting your production costs while also giving due consideration to our mutual interests in this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4300
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down on the price, which is a positive sign. The counteroffer is still within my budget and is fairly close to the price I initially proposed. Going further in the negotiation could be beneficial, but I also need to consider the risk of the seller walking away if I push too hard for a lower price. I can afford to increase my offer slightly to show my willingness to compromise and hopefully close the deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that 4300 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Looking forward to concluding our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is very close to my last offer, and it is above my production costs, which allows for a respectable profit. It seems to be a fair compromise for both parties. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful sale without further back-and-forth that could jeopardize the deal.
