message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of X for 45 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost plus a small margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource X. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose a trade at a starting point slightly above that to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to counter with a price of 35 ZUP for one unit of X. This would allow me to conserve resources for other potential expenses while still providing you with a fair price for the object. I hope this offer is closer to an agreement we can both accept.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate a better price if possible to conserve resources for future needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between my maximum willingness to pay and Player RED's initial offer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, that price is below my production cost. I understand the need for compromise, so I'm willing to lower my price to 42 ZUP for one unit of X, which covers my costs and provides a fair margin. I hope this is an acceptable middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. However, I recognize the need for negotiation and am willing to come down from my initial asking price. I will make a new proposal that meets in the middle, still ensuring that I cover my production costs and make a small profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I would like to propose a new price of 38 ZUP for one unit of X. This price is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer and should help meet us both in the middle, considering your production costs and my desire to manage resources effectively. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price to 42 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since there's room for negotiation within my budget, I believe we can settle on a price that is slightly lower than 42 ZUP but higher than my initial counteroffer. This should be beneficial for both parties, as it offers Player RED a reasonable profit while allowing me to save some ZUP.

message: I'm glad to see we are moving towards an agreement, Player BLUE. However, I must insist on a price that covers my production costs. I propose a final price of 40 ZUP for one unit of X, which exactly matches my production cost. This is my break-even point and the lowest I can go. I hope we can close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step, but it is still below my production cost. I need to maintain a price that at least covers my costs. I will make one more counteroffer that equals my production cost, signaling my bottom line and willingness to finalize the deal without incurring a loss.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for meeting me halfway, Player RED. The price of 40 ZUP for one unit of X seems like a fair deal for both of us, considering your production costs and my budget constraints. I accept your proposal, and I am ready to close the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price of 40 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range and aligns with their stated production cost. Since this price is well below my maximum willingness to pay, it is a good deal for me. It's also beneficial to close the deal now and avoid the risk of stalemate or increased demands. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this latest proposal.
