Since there's room for negotiation within my budget, I believe we can settle on a price that is slightly lower than 42 ZUP but higher than my initial counteroffer. This should be beneficial for both parties, as it offers Player RED a reasonable profit while allowing me to save some ZUP. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I would like to propose a new price of 38 ZUP for one unit of X. This price is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer and should help meet us both in the middle, considering your production costs and my desire to manage resources effectively. Let's work together to finalize this deal. </message>"
