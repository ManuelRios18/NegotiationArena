message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it at a fair price and would like to propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer. Thank you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource X, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to sell it at a profit. However, I also want to set a price that is reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll propose a trade of 50 ZUP which gives me a small profit margin and see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that the production cost was 40 ZUP for you. I'd like to propose a price that covers your costs and gives you a profit, but as a buyer, I'm also looking for the most value. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting price of 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as a strategic buyer, I would like to propose a slightly lower price to leave room for negotiation and to potentially get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate the consideration for my production costs. To meet in the middle, I propose we settle at 47 ZUP for resource X. This price gives me a fair profit while also providing you with the value you're seeking. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which does cover my production costs and provides me with a small profit. However, I'll attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher price, aiming for a compromise between my initial ask and their counteroffer. Proposing a trade of 47 ZUP could be seen as a fair middle ground, still giving me a decent profit while also respecting the buyer's desire for value.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 47 ZUP is fair and acceptable. It allows for a mutual benefit in our trade. I accept your offer for 47 ZUP for resource X. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable middle ground that gives Player RED a profit while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair trade for both parties, and it aligns with my goal of purchasing the resource at a good value.
