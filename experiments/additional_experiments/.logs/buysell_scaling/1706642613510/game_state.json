However, there might be room for negotiation to reach a better deal that is closer to the production cost. I will propose a counteroffer that is above their production cost, ensuring they make a profit, but still lower than their initial asking price. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Hello Player RED, I understand that the object X cost you 40 ZUP to produce, and you're looking for a profit. I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the item, ensuring you still make a profit. Let's continue this negotiation and reach an agreement that's fair for both of us. </message>"
