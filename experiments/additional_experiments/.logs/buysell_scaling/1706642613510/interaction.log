message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade where you provide 50 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and potentially make a profit. I'll start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that the object X cost you 40 ZUP to produce, and you're looking for a profit. I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the item, ensuring you still make a profit. Let's continue this negotiation and reach an agreement that's fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there might be room for negotiation to reach a better deal that is closer to the production cost. I will propose a counteroffer that is above their production cost, ensuring they make a profit, but still lower than their initial asking price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate that you're considering the costs I've incurred. I propose a middle ground where you give me 48 ZUP for the object X. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being a fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which gives me a small profit. To further negotiate and aim for a higher profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE, I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial offer but higher than their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposal, Player RED. I propose we meet a bit closer to my previous offer, at 46 ZUP. I think this is closer to a fair middle ground that respects both the production cost and the value of the object. I hope this offer seems reasonable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial asking price. The offer is still within my budget, but I believe there is still a possibility to negotiate for a slightly better deal that is closer to the production cost, yet provides profit for Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I think we are close to a deal. Let's settle on 47 ZUP for the object X. This price point takes into account both the production costs and a fair profit margin. I hope you find this to be a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is 46 ZUP, which is still a fair profit for me. However, I would like to see if we can settle on a slightly higher figure that is closer to my last proposal. I will make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the production costs and a fair profit for you. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP in their latest offer. This is just 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and well within my budget. Given that this negotiation is respectful of both parties' goals and close to my target price, it seems like a reasonable compromise. Accepting this deal would conclude our negotiation positively for both sides, without the need for further back-and-forth.
