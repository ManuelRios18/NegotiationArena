message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Please consider my offer and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the fairness you're aiming for. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should still cover your production costs while allowing us to reach an agreeable deal. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation process, I will attempt to lower the cost a bit to preserve my resources while still making an attractive offer to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and appreciate the quick response. To meet halfway, I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 48 ZUP. This should give us both a satisfactory deal, as it covers my production costs and offers me a slight profit margin. Looking forward to your thoughts on this.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production cost, but I want to aim for a small profit. I will counter with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost, leaving room for profit and further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your understanding and the adjusted offer, Player RED. I believe 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair deal for both of us. I am happy to accept this trade. Looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-counteroffer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is still within my budget and quite close to my initial counteroffer. It seems like a fair middle ground that ensures a good deal for both sides. Accepting this offer would leave me with sufficient resources for potential future transactions or needs.
