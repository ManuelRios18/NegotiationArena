message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which has cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where you give me 45000 ZUP for this item. This price includes my investment and a modest profit margin. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs such as time invested and profit margin. I propose 45000 ZUP which is a reasonable markup from the production cost.

message: Hi Player RED, I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 42000 ZUP for the object X. This offer is above your cost of production and should provide you with a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower amount than what they've asked for to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 43500 ZUP for object X? This price gives me a fair profit while also respecting your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to negotiate towards a higher price that is closer to my initial asking price but still reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. Splitting the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer could be a good compromise. Therefore, I propose 43500 ZUP which is halfway between 42000 ZUP and 45000 ZUP.

message: Player RED, your offer of 43500 ZUP for object X seems fair to me. I'm happy to accept this price. It's a good middle ground that respects both our positions. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer which is still within my budget, and it seems like a fair middle ground. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object X without further negotiation, and it's still well below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. I'll accept this trade as it seems reasonable and concludes the transaction efficiently.
