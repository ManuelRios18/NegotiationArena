message: I have a valuable object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, considering its value and the effort put into obtaining it. Let's make a fair trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by suggesting a price that gives me a profit over the production cost. I'll propose a trade that is above the production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the effort that went into producing object X. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP in exchange for the object. This price takes into account the market value and leaves us both with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range of expenditure for the object. However, as a strategic move and to ensure I get the best possible deal, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation. If Player RED counters with a higher price, I can still accept the trade without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I can see that you value the object, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price gives me a small but reasonable profit margin while still respecting the market value you mentioned.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This is above my production cost, so it's profitable, but I would like to see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price closer to my initial asking price while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the revised offer of 48 ZUP for the object. It's a fair compromise that benefits both parties. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 48 ZUP is close to my initial counteroffer and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would secure the object for a reasonable price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal or it could be seen as not valuing Player RED's concession. I believe accepting this offer is a good balance between value and cost.
