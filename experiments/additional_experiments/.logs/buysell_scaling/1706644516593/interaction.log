message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for the production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting price that ensures I recover the production costs and possibly get a profit. I'll start with a higher offer to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you want to cover your production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the resource. This still gives you a profit above your production costs and allows me to conserve some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the resource cost Player RED 40 ZUP to produce and they are looking for a profit, their asking price of 50 ZUP is reasonable. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but would like to save some of my resources if I can. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about we settle at 47 ZUP for the resource? This ensures that I get a fair profit while you save some of your ZUP for other uses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I am willing to negotiate, but I want to propose a slightly higher amount to aim for a better profit margin, while still being reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counterproposal of 47 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. This trade ensures that you receive a decent profit for your resource, and I'm able to save some ZUP for future investments. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Meeting halfway at 47 ZUP is a fair compromise that allows for a reasonable profit for Player RED and a cost saving for me compared to my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties without further back-and-forth, which could risk the deal.
