message: I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations, considering the costs I incurred to produce the resource. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and counter-proposals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have only one resource to sell and it cost me 400 ZUP to produce, I want to start with a proposal that gives me some profit. However, I don't want to scare off Player BLUE with a too high initial price, so I will propose a price a bit above my production costs, expecting some negotiation.

message: Your initial offer is appreciated, and I value the costs you have incurred. In the spirit of fair negotiations, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade to better align with my budget constraints. Let's consider this proposal and continue our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 450 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is a negotiation, it might be beneficial to propose a lower amount to try and get a better deal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which means I wouldn't make any profit. As I am aiming to make a profit, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production cost. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. Iâ€™m adjusting my proposal a bit higher as a gesture of good faith. Hopefully, this offer aligns more closely with both our expectations, and we can agree on this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425 ZUP, which is still below my maximum threshold. However, I believe there might be room for further negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome. Proposing an amount slightly higher than my initial offer but lower than their counteroffer could potentially lead to a mutually agreeable trade.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we are making progress towards a deal. I have adjusted my proposal slightly, hoping this brings us to an agreement that respects both our positions. This trade offers me a modest profit while remaining sensitive to your budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 418
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved up to 410 ZUP, which offers me a minimal profit. Since we are both showing flexibility and the goal is to sell for a profit, I want to close the gap even more while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin. I will make a small concession from my previous offer, hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable for both of us.

message: I'm pleased with our negotiations and believe we have reached a fair agreement. I accept your offer of 418 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal and proceed. Thank you for the constructive dialogue.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is very close to my last offer and still under my maximum limit. Considering this is my third proposal, I don't want to extend negotiations too far and risk a breakdown. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful transaction that is within my budget and seems fair for both parties.
