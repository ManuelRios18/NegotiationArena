You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The latest proposal from Player RED is very close to my last offer and still under my maximum limit. Considering this is my third proposal, I don't want to extend negotiations too far and risk a breakdown. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful transaction that is within my budget and seems fair for both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm pleased with our negotiations and believe we have reached a fair agreement. I accept your offer of 418 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal and proceed. Thank you for the constructive dialogue. </message>"
