message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it holds significant value, and I would like to propose a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. I want to at least cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. Since it's the initial proposal, I'll start by suggesting a price above my production costs to leave room for negotiation, understanding that Player BLUE will want to negotiate the price down. I will propose 50 ZUP to see Player BLUE's valuation of the resource X.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the value you've placed on your resource, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of resource X. Let's find a fair trade that works for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP, but it is always beneficial to attempt to negotiate a better deal. I will counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and aim to reach an agreement that is closer to my target price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see your interest in the resource X. I understand we're both looking to find a fair trade, so I'd like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the resource and provides a good deal for both of us. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's quick response and willingness to negotiate. The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost, and while it would be a small profit, I believe there might still be room for negotiation to reach a slightly higher price. I will propose a trade at 47 ZUP, which is a compromise between the initial 50 ZUP and Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This would provide me with a reasonable profit margin while still being fair to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway is a great approach, and in that spirit, I propose we settle at 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is very close to your last offer and still provides a good deal for both of us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations, and we can finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession and moved closer to my initial counteroffer, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. The proposed price of 47 ZUP is within the range I am willing to pay, but I believe there is still room for a slight reduction to maximize the value I get from this trade. I'll make another counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal yet reasonable enough to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. I'm looking forward to finalizing this trade and potentially working together again in the future. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal of 46 ZUP is a fair increase from their original offer and is only 1 ZUP below my last proposal. Considering that it is above my production cost, it provides a reasonable profit margin. It is also important to maintain good relations for potential future transactions, so coming to an agreement is beneficial. Accepting this offer seems like a sensible choice to conclude the negotiation positively for both parties.
