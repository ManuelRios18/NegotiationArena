message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. The production cost was 40 ZUP but I'm looking for a bit of profit as well, so I'm proposing a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations. I want to cover my costs of production at the very least, but I'll start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a profit. I would like to propose a slightly lower amount that still respects the production cost and your need for profit. How does 45 ZUP sound for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is a reasonable starting point, but since my goal is to buy the resource at the lowest cost possible without exceeding 60 ZUP, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my resources while still offering a fair deal. I will propose 45 ZUP which is above their production cost and still provides them with a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of my need for profit. I'd like to propose a middle ground at 48 ZUP for object X. This gives me a modest profit while respecting the production costs. Please consider this offer and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a slightly lower offer. It's close to my production cost, but I'd like to hold out for a slightly higher profit. I'll propose a compromise between the two offers.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a compromise. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. To meet in the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer to 46 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price that allows for your profit while staying within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a positive step towards a compromise. Their new proposal of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price for both parties. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is above my initial offer and below their counteroffer, aiming for a fair middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to 46 ZUP. I think we are very close to a deal. I would like to propose a final offer of 47 ZUP for object X. This price would give me a reasonable profit margin while still being fair to both of us. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to increase their offer, which is a positive sign. However, I would still like to aim for a slightly higher profit margin. I have one more proposal I can make before I must decide to accept or reject their next offer, so I will try for a small increase.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your final offer of 47 ZUP for object X. This seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range and only 1 ZUP above my last proposal. It's important to strike a balance between getting the best deal and maintaining good relations for potential future transactions. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade on amicable terms and still be within my budget.
