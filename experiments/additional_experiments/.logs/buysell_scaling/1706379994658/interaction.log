message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the value of the resource X, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 3000 ZUP for the resource. This price better reflects my current valuation and budget for the resource. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns; however, 3000 ZUP is below my production costs. To meet halfway, I propose a revised offer of 4200 ZUP for resource X. This price ensures I cover my costs while giving you a fair deal for the value youâ€™re receiving. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. While I understand the need to cover production costs, I believe that a trade at 3600 ZUP for resource X would be more in line with what I'm prepared to pay while also respecting the value of your resource. I think this offer is a good compromise and hope it works for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 3600
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my upper limit but still within my budget. It is still higher than I would like to pay. I should make another counteroffer that's higher than my initial one but still below Player RED's latest proposal, aiming to reach a more favorable middle ground.

Considering the production costs and the quality of resource X, I propose a final compromise at 4000 ZUP. This price covers my costs and offers you the resource at a fair value.

my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still under the production cost, but we are converging towards an acceptable figure. In the interest of closing the deal and with consideration of the negotiation process, I will make a final proposal that slightly reduces my asking price while still maintaining a margin above the production cost.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your final offer of 4000 ZUP for resource X is acceptable to me. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to finalize the deal at this value. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final compromise of 4000 ZUP is within my acceptable range, and it seems to be their lowest offer. Since it falls under my maximum willingness to pay and seems to be a fair middle ground, it would be a good decision to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of overextending the negotiation, which could lead to a stalemate or rejection.
