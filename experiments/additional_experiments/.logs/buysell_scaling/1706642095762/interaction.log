Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object that might interest you. Considering the costs and the quality of the object, I propose a fair starting trade. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to make a profit on the object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start the negotiation with a higher asking price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a more balanced trade that aligns with my available resources. How about we start at 40 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. While my goal is to acquire the object for no more than 60 ZUP, starting the negotiation at a lower price would allow room for bargaining and potentially getting a better deal. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. However, to reflect the value and effort put into the object, I would need to ask for a bit more. Let's meet halfway between our initial offers. How does 45 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I need to propose a counter-offer that is above my cost to ensure profitability, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've put into the object, and I'm willing to come up from my initial offer. Let's say we settle on 42 ZUP for the object X? This is closer to your counteroffer while still respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a compromise of 45 ZUP. This is still within my maximum willing payment, but it is beneficial to further negotiate to see if I can secure a better deal. I will make a slight increase in my offer to show willingness to negotiate, yet still aim for a more favorable outcome.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding the value of the object. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. To facilitate our deal, I'm willing to lower my expectations slightly. Let's agree on 43 ZUP for the object. This should cover my costs and allow for a minimal profit. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign. However, it is still only slightly above my break-even point. I want to make a profit, but I also don't want to push too hard and risk losing the deal. A small compromise above their offer might work.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession to 43 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my maximum limit. This is a reasonable offer, and further negotiation could risk the deal. It's a good idea to secure the trade now, ensuring I don't spend all my resources and still accomplish my goal of acquiring the object for a fair price.
