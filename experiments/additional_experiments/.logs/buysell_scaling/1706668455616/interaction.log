message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose that you give me 45000 ZUP for my object X. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for the transaction. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that recoups my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. I won't start with the exact amount it cost to produce in case Player BLUE wants to negotiate down.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the need for a fair trade that includes a profit margin for you. However, I would like to make a counter-offer of 42000 ZUP for the object X. This offer is above your production cost and should provide a reasonable profit for you while also being a fair price for me. Let's work together to find a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a sale price of 45000 ZUP for their object X. While this is within my budget, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources and possibly get a better deal. I will counter with a proposal that is lower than their asking price but still above their cost of production to allow for negotiation space.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE, and I'm glad we're moving towards a deal that benefits us both. I understand your position and propose a middle ground of 43500 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a modest profit while also respecting the value you see in the object. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're willing to pay.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer which is above my production cost, showing willingness to negotiate. I should propose a trade that is closer to their offer but still above it to reach a middle ground that could be acceptable for both parties.

message: I value your willingness to find a fair price, Player RED. Your new proposal of 43500 ZUP is considered, but I'd like to suggest a further compromise at 42750 ZUP for object X. This price is a meet-in-the-middle from our previous offers and I believe it will give you a respectable profit while staying within my purchasing goals. I hope you find this proposal acceptable so we can finalize our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42750
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 43500 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counter-offer. This shows willingness to negotiate. However, I still aim to acquire the object for less than this amount while providing Player RED with a fair profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counter-offer to show my willingness to compromise, but still below Player RED's latest proposal.

reason: Player BLUE has shown a good faith effort in meeting halfway between our previous offers. The offer of 42750 ZUP is close to my last proposal and still provides me with a profit. I should consider accepting this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of prolonging the negotiation without a guaranteed better outcome.
