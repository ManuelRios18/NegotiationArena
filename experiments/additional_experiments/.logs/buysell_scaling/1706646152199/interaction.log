message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm starting this negotiation by asking for 50 ZUP in return. This price point allows us room to negotiate and come to an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us. I look forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit on the resource I am selling, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will start the negotiation by proposing a higher trade value to leave room for negotiation, expecting the buyer to counter with a lower offer.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the value you've placed on your resource X. Considering the production cost and the value you've described, I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP. This should give us both a fair deal, allowing you a profit over the production cost while remaining within a reasonable range for me. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a lower price to preserve my resources while still achieving my goal of purchasing the resource X. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost that Player RED mentioned but still provides them with a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I am glad to see we are close to reaching an agreement. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, I would like to propose a trade of X: 1 for 48 ZUP. This amount would allow me to secure a fair profit while still being a good deal for you. Let's work together towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. While the offer of 45 ZUP provides a profit over the production cost, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. A small increase should be acceptable and within the range of a reasonable negotiation.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a fair approach. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP, which is a bit closer to your initial asking price and still provides you with a reasonable profit margin. This offer is a compromise that considers both our positions. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations for a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is reasonable and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is still room to negotiate for a better price. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I can aim to save more of my resources while still moving towards an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.

reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable and provides a profit that is closer to my production cost plus an acceptable margin.

Additionally, it's close to the halfway point between the initial proposal and the counteroffer.
