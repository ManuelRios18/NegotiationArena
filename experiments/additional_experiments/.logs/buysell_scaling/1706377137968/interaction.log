Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource ready for you. Considering the production costs and value, I believe 500 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to set a price that covers my production costs and also allows for a profit margin. However, I want to leave room for negotiation, so I won't start with too high a price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. However, I would like to propose a more balanced trade considering the market conditions. How about 450 ZUP for the resource? This could be a good middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 500 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's a good strategy to negotiate for a better deal to conserve resources while still achieving my goal, so I will counter-offer with a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about the market conditions and I'm willing to come down on the price. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How does 475 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 450 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and covers the production costs with a decent profit. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly higher price without risking the deal. I will propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our two initial proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 475 ZUP seems like a fair compromise. I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by reducing their asking price to 475 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a reasonable counter-offer and only 25 ZUP more than my last proposal, accepting this trade would secure the resource without significantly impacting my resources. It is also beneficial to close the deal efficiently and avoid the risk of over-negotiating.
