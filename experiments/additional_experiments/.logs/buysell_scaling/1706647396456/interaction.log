message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP, considering the production cost was 40 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the transparency regarding the production cost. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this still gives you a reasonable profit margin while allowing me to preserve some resources for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay, but as a negotiation tactic, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there is room to save some of my resources while still reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I understand your intention to save resources, but I would like to propose we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. This allows me to maintain a decent profit while also respecting your need for resource conservation for future investments. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer close to my production cost. I want to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit while still reaching an agreement.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP seems like a fair compromise for both of us. I accept this offer and look forward to concluding this deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a successful transaction for me, securing the object X while remaining under budget. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer to avoid further back-and-forth and to finalize the deal efficiently.
