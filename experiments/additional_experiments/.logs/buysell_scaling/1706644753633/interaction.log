message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the production cost, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that allows me to recover the production costs of the resource and potentially make a profit. However, I should not start with too high of a price that might deter Player BLUE from negotiating.

message: I understand the quality and value of the resource you are offering, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP, considering that I'm looking to maintain a balance between fair pricing and my available resources. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within the range that I'm willing to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I should propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and possibly get a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for balance. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 47 ZUP for the resource, which is just a bit above your offer. This small increase should reflect the quality of the resource while still being a reasonable price for us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my asking price and covers my production costs with a small profit. To keep the negotiations moving forward and to show willingness to compromise, I will propose a price slightly above their offer, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price that reflects the quality of the resource while also being reasonable for my budget. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-counteroffer by only increasing the price by 2 ZUP from my last proposal. Since this price is still well within my maximum willingness to pay and seems fair for the quality of the resource, it would be prudent to accept this offer and close the deal.
