message: I am offering my valuable object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it is fair to ask for a price that reflects its value and covers my costs, so I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiations by setting a price that gives me a profit but also leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your object and your production costs, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for your object X. This offer is close to your asking price while also being a good deal for both of us, considering the market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to propose a slightly lower trade to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I get the best value for my ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a good deal. However, considering the quality and value of object X, I propose a fair compromise at 48 ZUP. This price gives us both a reasonable agreement, allowing me to cover my costs and make a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to reach a middle ground that would be profitable for me while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility and the quality of object X. How about we meet halfway from our last two offers? I propose 46 ZUP as a fair trade that benefits us both, allowing you to cover your costs with a profit, while I get the object X at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still within the range of what I am willing to pay, but I believe there is still room for a slight negotiation downward. By proposing a price between my initial offer and the current counteroffer, I aim to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair middle ground for both of us. It allows me to make a profit and ensures you get object X at a reasonable price. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers. This offer allows me to make a profit while also being a fair price for Player BLUE. I want to close the deal now to ensure a sale and avoid dragging out the negotiation which could risk no sale at all.
