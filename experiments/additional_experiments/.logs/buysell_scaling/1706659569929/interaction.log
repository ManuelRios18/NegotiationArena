message: I'm offering you this valuable resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to start at a price that gives me a profit margin above my production costs. I'll start by proposing a price that is higher than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate from there.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the resource you're offering, but considering the market and my budget, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This is a good deal for both of us, as it gives you a profit over your production cost and allows me to acquire the resource within my budget. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the seller's cost was 40 ZUP and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, there is a negotiation window. I want to propose a price that is closer to the middle of our two price points to try and get a better deal while still keeping the trade appealing to the seller.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP and your understanding of the value of the resource. To meet in the middle, I propose a trade for 48 ZUP. This price ensures a reasonable profit for me while respecting your budget constraints. I believe this is a balanced offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides me with a marginal profit. However, I believe there's still room for a slightly better offer. I want to counter with a price closer to my initial ask but still below it, showing willingness to negotiate while aiming for a fair profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving toward a fair agreement. I propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is a bit closer to my initial counteroffer but still gives you a profit beyond your production costs. I think this offer is a good compromise and respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down slightly from their initial asking price, which is a good sign of their willingness to negotiate. The new offer of 48 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay but I believe there is still room for a slightly better price that can benefit both of us without cutting too much into the seller's profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal. As a final proposal from my side, I suggest we settle at 47 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit while staying within a reasonable range for you. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has improved their offer to 46 ZUP, which is still a decent profit margin. Since this is the third proposal and the negotiations have been in good faith, it might be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of the deal falling through. However, I will attempt one final counteroffer to see if I can secure a slightly higher price, while still remaining open to concluding the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your final proposal of 47 ZUP. It's a fair price and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has made a final proposal that is only 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my budget. Since this is the seller's final offer and it is close to my previous counteroffer, it makes sense to accept this proposal to ensure the deal goes through and I acquire the resource within my maximum willingness to pay.
