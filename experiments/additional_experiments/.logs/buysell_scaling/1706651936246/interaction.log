message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which I am willing to sell. It has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a starting trade where you give me 60 ZUP for my object X. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by asking for a higher amount than the production cost to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal. I will propose 60 ZUP which gives me a profit margin and can be negotiated down if necessary.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter with a proposal where I give you 50 ZUP for your object X. Please consider this offer and let me know if it works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is at the maximum price I am willing to pay according to my goals. However, as a buyer, I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay, thus preserving some of my resources.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. I would like to meet in the middle and propose 55 ZUP for my object X. This price gives us both a fair deal considering the production cost and potential value. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which ensures a profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I will propose a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Hello Player RED, I find your proposal of 55 ZUP for object X to be a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 55 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at a price of 55 ZUP, which is slightly below my maximum willingness to pay. This offer is closer to my target price and saves me 5 ZUP from the original asking price. It's a fair middle ground and it's within my acceptable spending range, so it's reasonable to accept this proposal.
