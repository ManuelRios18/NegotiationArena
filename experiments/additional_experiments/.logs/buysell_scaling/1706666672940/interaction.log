message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose to sell you my resource X for 45000 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also offers me a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Given that the production cost is 40000 ZUP, I'd like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs and make a profit. I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I would like to make a counteroffer of 40000 ZUP for the resource X. This price is within my budget and allows for a fair transaction for both parties considering the market value. I hope this offer is acceptable to you, and I look forward to reaching an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45000 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in negotiations, it is common practice to counteroffer with a lower amount to leave room for bargaining and reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to pay the production cost. However, to account for the effort and investment put into producing resource X, I propose a revised price of 42500 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit while still being reasonable for you. I hope we can agree on this as a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost. While it would allow me to break even, it does not account for any profit. Since I want to make a profit, I will counter with a price that is lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. This should be a fair middle ground to provide me with a margin while also considering Player BLUE's budget constraints.

message: I appreciate your understanding and the adjustment in your price. I believe we are getting closer to a fair deal. I propose a new price of 41000 ZUP for resource X. This offer takes into account both the production costs and your profit while remaining within my budget constraints. I trust that this offer moves us towards a final agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42500 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since we are negotiating and the proposed price is reasonable, I can propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, which could potentially lead to an agreement.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. It's good to see that we're aligning on the value of resource X. I propose a slightly higher price of 42000 ZUP. This meets us halfway from the last two proposals and allows for a fair profit on my end while respecting your budget. I hope you find this proposal agreeable and we can conclude our negotiation successfully.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 41000 ZUP, which provides a small profit margin over the production cost. This is closer to my desired outcome. However, I believe there is still room for a slight increase to ensure a better profit margin. I will make one more counteroffer, still keeping in mind Player BLUE's budget and our mutual interest in finalizing the deal.
