Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I understand the value of resource X, and I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates the production costs and effort involved. Considering the market and the quality of X, my asking price is 450000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my initial proposal aims to recover the production costs of the resource, which amounts to 400000 ZUP. I will start by proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource X and understand the costs associated with its production. However, I'd like to propose a starting trade at 400000 ZUP to leave some room for further negotiation. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price is lower than the maximum I'm willing to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible. I'll propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process, knowing there's room to meet in the middle if needed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet the production costs. However, to account for the effort and to reach a fair deal, I propose a middle ground of 425000 ZUP. This should cover the production costs as well as provide a reasonable profit for the quality of resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost of the resource, which doesn't leave any profit margin for me. While I want to make a sale, I also want to ensure I receive some return on my investment. I will counter-propose with a price that's between my initial ask and their offer to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 425000 ZUP is a fair middle ground that respects the value of resource X and your production efforts. I accept this trade, and I look forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425000 ZUP, which is a reasonable price and still well under my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair compromise that acknowledges both the production costs and the effort involved. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for me and end the negotiation positively for both parties.
