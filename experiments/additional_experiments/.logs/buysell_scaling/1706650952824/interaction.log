message: I'm offering you a well-valued object, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a price that gives me a profit while leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the object's production cost and market value, I propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this is closer to a fair trade for both of us, taking into account the production costs and a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better price than the starting point offered by Player RED. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and they are asking for 50 ZUP, I will propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation. I'll start by offering 45 ZUP, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle, closer to my target.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle for 48 ZUP? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while also giving you the object at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 45 ZUP which is above my production cost but slightly lower than my initial asking price. I want to aim for a higher profit margin while still making the deal appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a middle ground that is profitable for me and hopefully acceptable to them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I believe we are close to a deal. I propose 46 ZUP for the object. It is a price that respects both your production costs and my budget constraints, while also allowing for a fair profit on your end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'd like to push for a slightly better deal while still maintaining a collaborative negotiation stance. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is a modest increase from my initial offer and still under the maximum I'm willing to pay, with the hope that it's acceptable to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is fair and acceptable. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between their previous offer and my last proposal. It's only 2 ZUP below my last offer and still ensures a profit of 6 ZUP over my production costs. It's a reasonable offer that I'm willing to accept to secure a deal that is beneficial for both parties.
