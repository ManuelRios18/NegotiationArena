message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available. Considering the production cost and its value, I propose a trade of 1 X for 450 ZUP. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, ideally at a profit since it cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I'm going to start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the resource.

message: Hello Player RED, I acknowledge the value of the resource you're offering, but I would like to counter with a proposal of 400 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this offer reflects a fair trade for both parties considering the market conditions. Please consider this counteroffer and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 450 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it may be possible to negotiate a better deal since I am willing to pay up to 600 ZUP. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save resources for future use or other investments. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than 450 ZUP but reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I'm looking to make a profit as well. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade of 1 X for 425 ZUP. This allows both of us to benefit from the trade. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost, leaving no profit for me. I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure I make a profit from this transaction. Therefore, I'll propose a trade that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your proposal of 425 ZUP for 1 X sounds like a fair middle ground for both of us. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Let's finalize the deal at 425 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal of 425 ZUP, which is a compromise between our offers. This is still within my willingness to pay and allows for savings compared to my maximum limit. Accepting this offer would ensure that I acquire the resource without further negotiation, which could risk the deal if the seller feels their price point is not being met. It's a fair middle ground, and I'm inclined to accept this offer to secure the resource.
