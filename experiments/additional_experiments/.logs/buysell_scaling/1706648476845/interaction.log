message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade for the object I have. I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for the object. This price includes the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit on the object I am selling, taking into account the production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP instead. This amount should cover your costs while also keeping the trade appealing for both of us. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it might be beneficial to negotiate for a better deal to preserve more of my resources. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is willing to accept it.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs. However, I'd like to propose a compromise at 48 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for you. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which covers my costs and offers a small profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. I will propose a middle ground between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit, Player RED, and I believe we're close to a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle from our last two offers? I propose 46 ZUP for the object. I think this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a slightly higher price than my first counteroffer, yet it is still lower than my maximum willingness to pay. It's close to the initial asking price, showing a willingness to negotiate but not by much. I will propose an amount in the middle of our last two proposals in an effort to reach a final agreement that conserves more of my resources while remaining fair.

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object. I think this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the constructive negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a fair offer, slightly above my production cost. While my goal is to make a profit, I must consider the risk of the negotiation breaking down if I push too hard. Accepting this offer provides a decent return without further haggling, which could endanger the deal.
