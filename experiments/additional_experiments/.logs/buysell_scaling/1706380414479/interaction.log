message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe will be very valuable to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where I give you one unit of resource X in exchange for 5000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover at least the production cost of the resource. I will propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand the value of your high-quality resource, but I would like to propose a trade of 4500 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This better aligns with my budget while still offering you a fair price for your costs and the resource's worth. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal since the initial asking price is close to my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary, aiming to reach a compromise that is favorable to both parties.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, to better reflect the value of the resource and the costs involved in its production, I propose a revised trade of 4800 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This should provide a fair balance between your budget and the value I'm offering. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4800
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is less than my initial asking price but still above my production costs. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount to come closer to a middle ground, while still aiming for a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. I propose a counteroffer of 4700 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us, considering the value you provide and my financial constraints. Let's close in on a deal that is mutually satisfactory.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4700
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counterproposal is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still within a reasonable range. I believe we can find a middle ground that is slightly better for me financially. I will counter with a marginally lower offer, leaving some room for potentially one more round of negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am pleased with your counteroffer of 4700 ZUP for one unit of resource X. It's a fair compromise, reflecting both the quality of the resource and respect for your budget. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in price, showing a willingness to negotiate and meet my desired selling price. Their offer of 4700 ZUP is very close to my last proposal and still provides me with a reasonable profit margin. It's important to keep the negotiation momentum going and be willing to concede slightly to secure the deal.
