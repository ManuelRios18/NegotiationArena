message: I'm offering you a high-quality resource that will surely meet your needs. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe that 450000 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the selling party, my initial proposal should cover the production costs of the resource, but I should also be open to negotiation, understanding that the buyer would want to negotiate for a lower price. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the quality of the resource. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount to ensure that this transaction is within my budget. How about we settle for 400000 ZUP? I believe this is still a competitive price for the value you are providing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 450000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is important to negotiate to attempt to reduce the cost further, as paying less would be more beneficial for me. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but I also need to make a profit on this transaction. Let's meet halfway. I propose 425000 ZUP, which gives you a fair price for the resource and allows me a modest profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. However, I want to make the sale and understand that a negotiation typically meets in the middle. Thus, I'll counter with a price that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'd like to propose 415000 ZUP. This price would be more comfortable for my budget while still providing you with a profit. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer to meet halfway at 425000 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there might be room to negotiate slightly lower. By proposing a price between the initial offer and the current counteroffer, I can potentially save more while still presenting a reasonable price to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for the constructive negotiation. I accept your offer of 415000 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with the transaction at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is above my production costs, which means I would make a profit of 15000 ZUP. While it's not the initial profit I aimed for, it's a reasonable offer considering the negotiation process. It's close to the previous price I suggested, and further negotiation may result in diminishing returns or a stalemate. Accepting this offer seems like a prudent choice to ensure the sale and secure a profit.
