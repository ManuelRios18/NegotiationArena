message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the costs and effort put into producing it. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the object and make a profit. However, I should also consider that Player BLUE will want to negotiate, so I should not set the initial price too high, but still leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the costs involved in producing the object, but I would like to propose a new trade at 45 ZUP considering the market value and my budget constraints. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's strategic to propose a counteroffer to see if I can get the object for a lower price, possibly leaving room for unexpected costs or to save some ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. Considering both the production costs and the need for a fair deal on both sides, could we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit while still keeping the price within a reasonable range for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price, and while it does cover my production costs, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit margin. I need to be mindful not to push too high, as it might discourage the buyer and lead to a stalemate.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I am willing to accept the offer of 48 ZUP for the object, as it seems like a fair compromise. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget and willingness to pay, and they have come down from their original asking price. It's reasonable to expect that this is close to their bottom line. Accepting this offer could ensure the deal goes through without risking losing the object over a small difference in price, and I would still retain some ZUP for future use.
