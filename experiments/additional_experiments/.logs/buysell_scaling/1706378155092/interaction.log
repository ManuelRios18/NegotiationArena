message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a bit more than the production costs, so how about 450 ZUP for it? Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP. Since it cost 400 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even, but ideally, I'd like to make a profit to justify the sale. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs and gain profit. However, I have to consider my budget as well. Would you be willing to part with your resource X for 420 ZUP? It's a bit closer to the amount I was prepared to spend today.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 450 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as a negotiating tactic, I aim to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure the resource at a better price.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand the importance of staying within budget. Let's meet in the middle. How about 435 ZUP for the resource X? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit. However, it is lower than my initial asking price. As this is a negotiation, I will propose a number that splits the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer, aiming for a compromise that is favorable to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair to me. I accept your offer of 435 ZUP for resource X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 435 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay, but it's always good to attempt to achieve a better deal. However, since the counter is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer, it might be wise to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through, especially considering the resource's value to me.
