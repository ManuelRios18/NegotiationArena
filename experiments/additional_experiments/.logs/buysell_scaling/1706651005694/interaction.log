message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I offer you my object X for 50 ZUP. This price includes a modest markup considering the production costs and the value of the item. I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, for a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that offers a reasonable markup above my costs, aiming to initiate negotiations and gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

message: Hi Player RED, thank you for your initial offer. I value the object X and understand that there are costs associated with it. However, I'm looking to reach an agreement that suits us both and would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has suggested a starting proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X, my goal is to negotiate a price that is closer to my willingness to pay which is at most 60 ZUP for the resource. I would like to propose a lower amount to begin the negotiation process, leaving room for adjustments while approaching my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the production costs. Since I am looking to make a profit from this transaction, I propose meeting halfway between our two offers. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the object X? This would give me a small margin while still being a fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost, which does not allow for any profit. To encourage a deal that benefits both parties, I'll propose a slightly reduced amount from my initial offer but still above my cost to ensure a profit. I want to come across as willing to negotiate but also firm that I need to cover more than just my costs.

message: Player RED, I agree that 45 ZUP is a fair compromise. It's important for both of us to feel satisfied with the deal. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to concluding this transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the resource. This is a fair middle-ground offer and is only 5 ZUP above the price I initially proposed. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the object while staying under my maximum willingness to pay, and it would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties.
