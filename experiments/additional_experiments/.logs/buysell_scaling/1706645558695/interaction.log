message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an item that I believe could be of value to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, and given its quality and potential, I'd like to propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Of course, I'm open to your thoughts and counter-proposals. Looking forward to a fruitful negotiation!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a price that allows me to make a profit but is also potentially attractive to Player BLUE. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by asking for a higher price to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay more and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the value you've placed on the item. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is a common negotiation strategy to propose a counter-offer that is lower than what you are willing to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal. Thus, I will counter with a lower offer.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-offer. I can appreciate the thought you've put into it. In the spirit of negotiation and finding common ground, how about we settle at 48 ZUP for the item? It's a bit closer to my initial asking price and still gives you a valuable item below the 50 ZUP mark. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but since this is a negotiation, I'll propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle. This will still give me a profit and might be seen as a reasonable compromise by Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I'd like to propose a new amount of 46 ZUP for the item. This is a little above my initial counter-offer and still provides you with a fair price for your investment. I hope this is a step towards finalizing our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's closer to my initial counter-offer, which is a positive step. However, as negotiations typically involve back-and-forth to reach a middle ground, I will make another proposal with a slightly increased amount from my last offer, but still below their current asking price to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. We're indeed getting closer to an agreement. To move us towards finalizing our deal, I propose we meet at 47 ZUP for the item. This is a slight increase from your offer and ensures a fair transaction for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a fair increment from their previous offer. Since this is my third proposal, I want to get closer to a final agreement. I will propose 47 ZUP, which is a minimal increase and could be acceptable to Player BLUE, while still giving me a reasonable profit margin.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair transaction for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP higher than my last offer and still comfortably below my maximum willingness to pay. Given that this negotiation is about finding a middle ground and we are both showing flexibility, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. It allows me to acquire the item for less than my maximum budget and concludes the negotiation amicably and efficiently.
