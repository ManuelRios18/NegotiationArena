message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose trading my 1 X for 50 ZUP to start our negotiations. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I'd like to start with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and hopefully arrive at a fair price that gives me a profit.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for 1 X. This could be a good starting point for us to find an agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation and to get a better deal if possible. It's important to start the negotiation without reaching my maximum limit too soon.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I'd like to make a small profit on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for 1 X? This should give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production costs, but I aim to make a profit. I would like to suggest a value in between my initial proposal and their counteroffer to move towards a compromise.

message: I agree that meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP for 1 X is fair for both of us. I accept your proposal. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair middle ground and only slightly above my initial counteroffer. Accepting this deal will allow me to acquire the resource within my budget and end the negotiations on good terms.
