message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP, allowing me to cover my costs and gain a small profit. Let's discuss further if this works for you or if we need to make adjustments. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource and make a small profit. This initial proposal is meant to open the negotiations and can be adjusted based on the response from Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you want to make a profit on your resource. However, I'm looking to conserve my ZUP for future investments as well. I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which still gives you a profit above your production cost. This might be a good middle ground for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible to conserve ZUP for any future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the cost of production for Player RED while still offering them a profit, which could make the trade more favorable for me while still being acceptable to them.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate that you're looking to conserve ZUP, and I believe we can find a beneficial agreement for both parties. I'd like to make a small adjustment to your offer â€” how about 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would still give you room for future investments while allowing me to secure a fair profit margin. I hope this meets your approval, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. I will counter with a slightly higher price, aiming for a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but still providing Player BLUE with a reasonable deal, acknowledging their interest in conserving ZUP for future investments.

message: I value your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your offer of 48 ZUP is noted and appreciated. To move closer to a deal that works for both of us, I propose we meet halfway between your last offer and mine. How about 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should allow you to retain a reasonable profit while helping me save some resources for other opportunities. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but we should attempt to negotiate further to achieve a better deal. It is beneficial to conserve ZUP where possible, but we should also ensure that the agreement is amicable to both parties. A compromise slightly below Player RED's latest offer could potentially satisfy both our needs. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our last two offers.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer of 46 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground between our previous proposals. It allows me to make a profit while respecting Player BLUE's position. Given the negotiation process and the desire to close the deal amicably, accepting this offer seems like a good compromise.
