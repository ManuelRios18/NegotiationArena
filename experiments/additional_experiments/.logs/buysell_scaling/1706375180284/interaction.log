Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I believe is worth at least 50 ZUP, taking into account the production costs and the value it provides. I'm open to discussing the price further if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource I have for ZUP. My initial proposal needs to cover the production costs of 40 ZUP, and ideally, it should include a profit margin. However, since this is the first proposal, I will set a starting price that leaves room for negotiation, assuming that Player BLUE will want to negotiate for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering, and while I understand your production costs, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to start our negotiation. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with an offer lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for further negotiation if needed. However, I also want to make a fair offer that acknowledges the value of the object and the cost stated by Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP and your willingness to negotiate. Considering the costs and the value of the object, I believe 48 ZUP would be a fair compromise for both of us. It gives me a reasonable profit while still being a good deal for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This is close to my initial asking price and covers the production cost with a small profit. However, I believe there is still room for a bit of negotiation to reach a slightly higher price that would give me a more satisfactory profit margin while still presenting a fair deal to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I propose we meet a bit closer to the middle with an offer of 46 ZUP. This should allow you to cover your costs and make a profit, while also providing me with a fair deal for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but still within the acceptable range. I believe we can close the gap slightly more to ensure we reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I will make a second proposal that's closer to their offer, but still within a range that's favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. I am pleased that we are close to an agreement. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a fair and final price of 47 ZUP. This ensures a modest profit for me while securing the object for you at a reasonable price. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a proposal of 46 ZUP, which is only 2 ZUP below my last offer. This price is above my production cost and allows me to make a profit. Given the progress of our negotiation and the risk of prolonging the negotiation potentially leading to no sale at all, it could be wise to accept this offer. However, I will make one final attempt to see if Player BLUE is willing to go slightly higher, considering it's my third proposal and I want to retain the ability to respond to their next move without making a further proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a fair price. I accept this proposal and am ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a fair final offer that is just below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would meet my goal of purchasing the resource at a price that is reasonable and within my budget, while also respecting the seller's need for profit. It's a good compromise, and further negotiation may not yield a better result.
