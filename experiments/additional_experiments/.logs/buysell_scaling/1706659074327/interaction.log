message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource X as my initial offer, keeping in mind the current market conditions and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a more favorable price.

message: I appreciate your budget concerns and the need to find a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet halfway and settle on 42 ZUP for resource X. This allows me to make a modest profit while still respecting your position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly at my production cost, which doesn't leave room for profit. However, I want to make a sale and maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions. Meeting in the middle could be a good compromise. I'll propose a price of 42 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit while considering Player BLUE's budget constraints.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal to meet halfway at 42 ZUP for resource X sounds reasonable to me. It's a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is within my acceptable range and only slightly above my initial counteroffer. It is a fair midpoint between our two proposals, and accepting this offer would secure the resources I need without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.
