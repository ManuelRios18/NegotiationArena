message: I have this valuable object that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, but considering its value, I'm starting the bid at 5000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and I know it cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a starting trade that allows me to make a profit. However, I am also aware that the starting proposal should be somewhat reasonable to not immediately deter Player BLUE. I'll start by asking for a higher amount than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the starting point for the negotiation. I understand the value of the object, and I'm definitely interested. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 4800 ZUP, which I believe is still a fair price considering the production cost and the value of the object. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4800
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is reasonable given that my maximum willingness to pay is 6000 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate to try to obtain a better deal, especially since the starting bid is usually higher than what the seller expects to receive. I'll propose a slightly lower amount, which is still above their production cost, to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 4800 ZUP. I am glad to see we're not too far apart in our valuation. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. Would you consider 4900 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4900
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 4800 ZUP, which is still above my production cost, but less than my initial asking price. I would still make a profit at 4800 ZUP, but I believe there is a possibility to negotiate a slightly higher price that would be beneficial for both parties. Therefore, I'll counter with a price that's between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I think meeting halfway is a great idea, and 4900 ZUP for the object seems like a fair compromise. I accept your offer. Looking forward to more deals in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer by suggesting we meet halfway. This new proposal of 4900 ZUP is just slightly above my initial counteroffer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It's important to maintain good relations and goodwill in negotiations, and this could be a fair settlement. Accepting this offer would still leave me with significant resources for other potential needs or investments.
