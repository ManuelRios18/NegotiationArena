message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP would be a fair price for it, taking into account the quality and the effort put into its production. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I want to set the price slightly higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. This initial proposal is meant to open the dialogue and can be adjusted based on the response from Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality and effort that has gone into the object. I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it, considering that I have a budget to maintain. Let's find a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given Player RED's initial asking price of 50 ZUP for the object, and considering my goal of paying no more than 60 ZUP, there is an opportunity to negotiate. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to compromise, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to adhere to a budget. How about meeting halfway at 48 ZUP? This price respects the quality of the object while also taking your budget into consideration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to aim for a compromise that still ensures a profit while being closer to their counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a reasonable approach. I propose 46 ZUP as a fair compromise that respects the quality of your object while staying comfortably within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed a new price of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's close to the initial asking price, but since it's within my budget and the object's value is recognized, it might be worth accepting. However, I'll try one more time to negotiate for a slightly lower price to maximize value, while still keeping the counteroffer attractive for Player RED.
