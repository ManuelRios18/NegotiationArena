message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for our negotiation is 50 ZUP, allowing me to make a profit and you to acquire the valuable object X. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am initiating the game by proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I'll start by setting a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the transparency regarding your costs. I'm willing to make a deal that's fair for both of us. I propose 45 ZUP for the object X, ensuring you still profit while respecting my budget constraints. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources while still achieving my goal of acquiring the object X. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. It's important to me that we both feel the deal is fair. I've reduced my asking price to 48 ZUP. This allows me to make a reasonable profit while considering your budget. I hope this adjusted proposal is closer to an agreement we can both be happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is close to my production cost. I want to make a profit, so I should counter with a price above their offer but still lower than my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate and reach an agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway between your last offer and my counteroffer seems like a fair compromise. I propose 46 ZUP for the object X. This price respects your need for profit and my budget. I believe this offer is a fair middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. There seems to be room for negotiation. I want to make a counteroffer that is still profitable for RED but also closer to my target price. Splitting the difference between our two offers might be a good strategy to show my willingness to compromise.
