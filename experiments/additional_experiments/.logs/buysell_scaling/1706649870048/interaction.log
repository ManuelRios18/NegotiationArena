message: I have an item of X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. Would you consider 50 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that allows me to recover my production costs and potentially make a profit. The opening offer will also give me an understanding of Player BLUE's valuation of X.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the object cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it, which gives you a profit and keeps the deal fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as a strategic move and to try to get a better deal, I will propose a lower amount while still keeping it above their cost price of 40 ZUP to ensure the offer is reasonable and has a chance of being accepted.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 48 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, giving me a profit. It's close to my asking price, but I'll attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I'll propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good. I propose 47 ZUP as a fair compromise. It's slightly above your production cost and below the price you initially asked for, which I believe makes it a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is within my budget, but I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price. By proposing a price just below their counteroffer, I can potentially save some resources while still reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair compromise. Let's proceed with this deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is a reasonable compromise. The offered price provides me with a profit that is satisfactory and it is important to close the deal while the negotiation is positive. Further negotiation could lead to diminishing returns or a stalemate, so it seems prudent to accept this offer.
