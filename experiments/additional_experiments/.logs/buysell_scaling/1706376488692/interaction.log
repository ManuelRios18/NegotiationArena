message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of resource X for 500 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit over my production costs and provides you with the resource you need. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have one unit of resource X which costed me 400 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that allows me to at least recover my production costs, but also make a profit. Considering this is the first proposal, I will start with a price that is higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the resource X, but I'd like to propose a trade for 450 ZUP instead. This price would be more in line with my budget and still offer you a fair profit. Please let me know if this counterproposal is acceptable or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for potential future needs or other opportunities. I will counter with a lower offer that still provides room for further negotiation, aiming for a middle ground that is satisfactory to both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to come down on the price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade where I give you one unit of resource X for 475 ZUP. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while respecting your budget constraints. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to continue the negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 450 ZUP, which is still above my production costs. This is a fair counteroffer, but I'd like to propose a slightly higher amount to aim for a better profit margin while still keeping the negotiation active and moving towards a mutual agreement.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. I propose a slight adjustment to 460 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this revised offer takes into account both our interests fairly. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price point. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The new offer is closer to my initial counteroffer and seems like a fair middle ground. However, I could attempt one more round of negotiation to see if I can further optimize the trade in my favor. Considering I still have negotiation attempts left, I will make another counteroffer that is slightly lower than Player RED's last proposal but not as low as my first counteroffer, to signal my willingness to close the deal soon.

message: Your proposal of 460 ZUP sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept this offer. I believe we have reached a deal that benefits both of us. Let's finalize the trade at 460 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Thank you for the smooth negotiation, Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new price of 460 ZUP. This offer is still above my cost price, and although it is less than the previously proposed 475 ZUP, it is a good compromise. It would be beneficial to close the deal at this point to ensure a sale and a guaranteed profit rather than risk prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing the sale.
