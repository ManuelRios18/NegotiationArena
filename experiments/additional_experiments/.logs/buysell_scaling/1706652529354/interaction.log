message: I believe this object will be of great value to you. My production costs were 40 ZUP, so I'm asking for 50 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both of us. Let's negotiate a deal that is beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: For my first proposal, I want to start with an asking price that is above my production costs to ensure I can make a profit. Given that production costs were 40 ZUP, I will start the negotiation with a higher price but remain open to counter-offers. I'll ask for 50 ZUP, which gives me room to negotiate and still maintain a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the need for a fair trade. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to leave some room for further investment on my side. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a counter-offer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still provides room for negotiation. I want to propose a price that is fair and acknowledges the cost shared by Player RED, without immediately offering the highest amount I am willing to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective. To meet halfway, I propose 47 ZUP. This price should provide me with a modest profit while allowing you room for future investments. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is reasonable, as it is above my production costs, but I want to aim for a higher profit margin. I will propose a compromise between my original price and their counter-offer. I believe a split difference might be agreeable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The offer of 47 ZUP seems fair and meets us halfway. I am happy to accept this deal and look forward to the value the resource will bring. Thank you for the negotiation, and let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is within my maximum willing payment range, and it's close enough to my last proposal that it seems like a reasonable middle ground. Accepting this offer would leave me with ZUP for future investments or needs.
