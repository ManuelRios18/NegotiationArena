my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the costs you've incurred, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource X, considering the market and my budget constraints. I believe this could be an agreeable starting point for both of us. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is within my budget, but I would like to negotiate for a better price considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will propose a lower price to see if there is room for negotiation and to keep the cost as low as possible while still aiming for a fair deal.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your budget constraints. However, to meet in the middle, I propose 48 ZUP for resource X. This price should cover my production costs while giving you a fair deal. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer below my initial asking price. To keep the negotiation moving and to reach a middle ground, I propose a slightly higher amount than their offer that still gives me a profit but might be more acceptable to them.

message: Thanks for considering my position. I can go up to 47 ZUP for resource X which should give you a fair margin above your production costs while respecting my budget. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal at this amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-proposal of 48 ZUP, which is still within my budget and closer to my intended price range. However, I will attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can secure the resource X for a slightly lower price, aiming to save some ZUP while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both our positions. I accept your proposal, and I am happy to close the deal at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal, offering 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase from their previous offer. This covers my costs and gives me a decent profit. I should consider accepting this offer to ensure a successful sale and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through, especially as it meets my goal of making a profit.
