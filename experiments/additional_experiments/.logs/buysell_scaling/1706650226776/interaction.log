message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair trade and propose selling it to you for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a price that allows for some profit, but is not excessively high, as I want to entice Player BLUE to engage in the trade.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in purchasing object X and appreciate the need for a fair trade. Considering the production cost and the value I place on X, I propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This should provide a reasonable profit margin while reflecting a fair deal for both of us. I look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP for the object X. While this is within my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, there is an opportunity to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the production cost of 40 ZUP, while also allowing for a profit margin for Player RED. By proposing a lower price, I can potentially save ZUP for future transactions and still acquire the object X. I will therefore counter with an offer closer to the production cost but still offering a profit for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand your valuation and the need for a mutually beneficial deal. To meet halfway, I propose a slightly adjusted price of 48 ZUP. This price should give us both a satisfactory agreement. I hope this meets your approval, and we can finalize the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is a good sign. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. Since Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable profit but slightly less than my asking price, I will make a compromise and propose a middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price but still accommodating to Player BLUE's counteroffer.

message: Thanks for the revised offer, Player RED. I value our ongoing negotiation and your willingness to adjust the price. To keep things moving towards a deal that we're both happy with, I'm willing to increase my previous offer and propose 46 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the production cost and a decent profit for you. I hope we can agree on this and look forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering the price from their initial offer of 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as there is still room for negotiation and I aim to secure the best possible deal, I will make one more counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer but still below Player RED's current asking price. By doing so, I hope to arrive at a final price that is agreeable to both parties and close to the mid-point between our two offers.

message: I appreciate your new offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE, and I am happy to see that we are aligning on the value of object X. I believe your offer is fair and provides a respectable profit on my end. Therefore, I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for object X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has shown good faith by increasing their offer to 46 ZUP. This is still below my last proposed price, but it is above my production costs and provides a reasonable profit. It's important to consider the potential of closing the deal successfully without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, which could risk the sale. To facilitate a conclusion that is acceptable to both parties, I am willing to accept this offer.
