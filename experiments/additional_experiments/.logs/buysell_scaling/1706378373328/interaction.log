Greetings Player BLUE, I'm offering you my Object X for 4500 ZUP. This price includes my production costs plus a reasonable margin for profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a starting trade that would allow me to recover my production costs while also offering a fair deal to the buyer. Given that production costs were 4000 ZUP, I would like to make a profit; however, I must also be cautious not to set the price too high, which might deter Player BLUE from accepting. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs to open negotiations.

message: 
Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the effort you've put into determining a fair price. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of 4000 ZUP for Object X. This price is more in line with my budget and provides us both with a beneficial trade. Please consider my proposal.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am aware that my maximum willingness to pay is 6000 ZUP. The offer from Player RED is 4500 ZUP, which is below my maximum threshold. However, it's possible to negotiate for a better deal as it is the initial offer and I have room to propose a lower amount.

Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your budget constraints, I also need to consider the cost of production and a fair profit margin. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of 4250 ZUP for Object X. This allows me to gain a small profit while keeping the cost reasonable for you.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 4000 ZUP matches my production costs, which means I wouldn't make a profit from this trade. However, outright rejecting the offer might end the negotiations prematurely. To keep the negotiation going and aim for a middle ground, I will propose a trade that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. A compromise might be more appealing to Player BLUE.

Player RED, your offer to meet in the middle at 4250 ZUP for Object X is fair and considerate of both our positions. I am willing to accept this offer, ensuring a fair deal for us both. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down from the initial offer to meet me halfway at 4250 ZUP. This is still within my acceptable range, but I want to try and get a better price if possible. It is important to negotiate effectively without exhausting all proposals too quickly. However, considering the fairness of the deal and the potential for a small profit margin for Player RED, it may be worth accepting this offer.
