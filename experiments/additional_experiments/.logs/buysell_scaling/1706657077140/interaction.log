message: I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for a fair trade. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least my production cost of 40 ZUP for the object X. As a starting proposal, I will aim slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object X, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This would still give you a profit over your production costs and allow us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering the starting proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, I want to propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach an agreement that is more favorable for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. It's close to my initial asking price, and I understand the need for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and would result in a profit. However, I want to counter-propose with a slightly higher amount to reach a middle ground between my initial asking price and their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point in splitting the difference, and 48 ZUP is reasonable. However, I would like to propose 46 ZUP as a final offer that still ensures you make a profit and is just below our halfway mark. I believe this is a fair and equitable resolution for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is within my acceptable range, but I aim to negotiate the best possible price without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay. A small reduction would be ideal to maximize my benefit from this trade.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price for both parties. Let's finalize the deal at that amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and within the acceptable profit margin. It may be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through.
