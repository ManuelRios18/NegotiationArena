message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 45 ZUP for it. Would you be interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to recoup at least my production costs for the resource. Therefore, I will start by setting a price slightly above the production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount, and to have some room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you're asking for 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe that we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering market conditions and the value of the object, I would like to propose a price of 40 ZUP. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price is within my budget, but as a strategic move, I'll try to negotiate a lower price to preserve my resources. It's also common practice to counter the first offer to see if there is flexibility in the price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a slight profit for my efforts and investment in producing the object X. I think a fair compromise would be 42 ZUP. This would cover my production costs and provide a small profit for me. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay the exact production cost of the resource. While this would mean I would not incur a loss, I also would not make any profit. I believe it is reasonable to seek a small profit to justify the sale. Therefore, I will counter with a price that gives me a modest profit while still being fair to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand your need to make a profit. How about we settle at 41 ZUP? This would still give you a profit over your production costs and would make the trade more appealing to me. Shall we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, which is a good sign. The current offer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget, and it allows Player RED to make a profit. It's a fair middle ground between our initial proposals, so accepting this offer could be beneficial. However, I might try to get a slightly better deal to maximize the value I'm getting.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree to your offer of 41 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a proposal that is very close to my previous counteroffer. Considering we are just 1 ZUP apart and in the interest of completing the sale, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. It provides me with a profit, albeit small, and it also seems to be an amount that Player BLUE is comfortable with.
