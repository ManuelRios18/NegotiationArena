message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the value you've placed on the resource. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer. Considering production costs and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, how about 1 X for 42000 ZUP?

my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60000 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate for a better deal closer to the production cost to preserve my resources as much as possible. I'll propose a counteroffer that is above their production cost but still below their asking price.
