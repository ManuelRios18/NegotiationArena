Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade where I give you 1 X for 45 ZUP, leaving a margin for discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation with a price slightly above production costs to leave room for bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: 
I understand your production costs and the need for profit. However, I'd like to propose a trade of 42 ZUP for the resource. This leaves us both some room to further negotiate if needed.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the other player's starting proposal is within my budget and is a fair markup from their production cost, I see room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower trade offer to see if there is flexibility and to ensure I get the best deal possible within my willingness to pay.
