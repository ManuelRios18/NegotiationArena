message: I have an object which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 450000 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 400000 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade that would allow me to at least break even. I am proposing a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter with 425000 ZUP for the object. This is a fair price considering the market value and the costs you've incurred. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but it's my goal to acquire the object for less if possible. I want to make a counteroffer that's lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. To meet halfway, how about we settle on 437500 ZUP? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 437500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good, but as a negotiation strategy, I want to aim a bit higher to maximize my profits. I'll propose a price between my initial offer and their counteroffer to come closer to an agreement.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 437500 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. I accept this offer. Looking forward to concluding this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my budget and quite close to the amount I initially proposed. It seems like a fair middle point between our two offers. Accepting this proposal would secure the object for a price that's below my maximum willingness to pay and also save room for future negotiations or purchases.
