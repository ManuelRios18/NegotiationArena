It might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, but I also don't want to risk losing the object by pushing too hard. A small concession on my part might lead to a successful agreement that benefits both parties. I will make a small increase in my offer to show willingness to compromise and to edge closer to closing the deal. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for understanding my position, Player RED. Meeting halfway at 45 ZUP is a fair proposal. However, I would like to make a small adjustment and offer 43 ZUP for object X. This is closer to your asking price and still within my budget.
