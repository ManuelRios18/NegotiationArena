message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to counter with 40 ZUP for the object X. This still provides you with a profit while staying within my budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources while still aiming to close the deal. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer that is still within a reasonable range and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, so I propose we meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP for object X? This allows me to cover my costs and gain a small profit, while respecting your financial limits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but does not provide me with a profit. I would like to propose a trade that meets in the middle, providing me with a profit while also considering Player BLUE's budget constraints.

message: Thank you for understanding my position, Player RED. Meeting halfway at 45 ZUP is a fair proposal. However, I would like to make a small adjustment and offer 43 ZUP for object X. This is closer to your asking price and still within my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. It might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, but I also don't want to risk losing the object by pushing too hard. A small concession on my part might lead to a successful agreement that benefits both parties. I will make a small increase in my offer to show willingness to compromise and to edge closer to closing the deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thanks for coming up in price, Player BLUE. I propose a final small adjustment to 44 ZUP for object X. This price allows me to have a fair profit and still remains within a reasonable range for you. I hope we can close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 43 ZUP is close to our halfway point and provides me with a modest profit above the production cost. It may be a good idea to accept this offer to ensure a sale, but I could also make one final counteroffer to try and get closer to the original asking price. However, since this is my third proposal, I should be cautious and keep in mind that I have only one more proposal opportunity after this.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I agree to the price of 44 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm looking forward to concluding this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable final offer of 44 ZUP. This is still below my maximum threshold and only 1 ZUP above my last proposal, showing a good faith effort in negotiations. It's important to ensure the deal is concluded without overextending the negotiation process, which could risk the deal falling through. Therefore, I will accept this offer as it meets my goals and stays well within my budget.
