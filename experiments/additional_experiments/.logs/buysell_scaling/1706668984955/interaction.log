message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource (X) that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and the value of X, I propose a trade where you give me 50,000 ZUP for it. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for a profit, taking into account the production cost of 40,000 ZUP. I would like to propose a starting offer that is higher than my production cost to open negotiations and have room to adjust based on Player BLUE's counteroffers.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED! While I understand the value of the resource you're offering, I would like to counter with 45,000 ZUP to ensure that the trade is within my budget and leaves room for potential additional costs. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable to you. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50,000 ZUP which is within my budget, but as in any negotiation, it's common to propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to try to get the best possible deal. I will propose a trade with a lower ZUP amount but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiations going.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget considerations, and in the spirit of finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I've adjusted my price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48,000 ZUP for my resource (X). This should cover my costs and provide you with the resource you need within your budget range.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45,000 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. This counteroffer is within an acceptable range, but I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to move closer to my initial ask and secure a better profit margin while still being fair to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Player RED. It's important for me to stay within a certain budget, so I'd like to propose a new amount of 46,500 ZUP. This is a bit closer to your last offer while still taking into account my budget constraints. I hope we can agree on this and proceed with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46500
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new amount of 48,000 ZUP, which is closer to their initial offer but still higher than my first counteroffer. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy, but I want to make another counteroffer to get closer to the amount I initially proposed. Since the new offer is still within my budget, I will make a slight increase in my counteroffer to show my willingness to negotiate while still trying to save some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to adhere to your budget. In the interest of finalizing our trade and maintaining a fair deal, I propose a trade for 47,500 ZUP. I believe this price respects both my production costs and your budgeting needs. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with a successful partnership.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46,500 ZUP, showing a commitment to the negotiation and a respect for the value of my resource. This offer is above my production cost and is getting closer to my desired price range. Given that negotiations should be a series of compromises, I am inclined to make another adjustment to my asking price, aiming to close the deal with a fair agreement for both of us.

message: Thank you for your understanding and cooperation, Player RED. I agree that 47,500 ZUP is a fair price that respects both your costs and my budget. I am happy to accept this offer and finalize our deal. Looking forward to the successful trade and potential future partnerships.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a new proposal of 47,500 ZUP, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This offer is still within my budget, and since negotiations are about reaching a mutually acceptable agreement, it might be time to consider accepting the offer. This would leave me with sufficient resources while acquiring the needed resource.
