message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and my need to make a profit, I propose to trade my resource X for 50000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to set a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and also make a profit. I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to open up room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand your need for profit. I believe that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the market conditions and the value of resource X, I'd like to propose 45000 ZUP for your resource. This provides you with a profit above your cost and is within my budget. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50000 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic measure and to ensure a better deal, I should counter with a lower offer that still provides Player RED with a profit margin but is more favorable to me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway and finalize our deal with a satisfactory outcome for both of us, how about settling at 47500 ZUP for resource X? I believe this is a fair middle ground that gives me a reasonable profit while staying within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my initial asking price and offers a fair profit margin. However, it is standard in negotiations to counter slightly above the offer to reach a middle ground that is beneficial to both parties. I will propose a slightly higher amount, but still lower than my initial ask to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I agree that 47500 ZUP is a fair compromise that benefits us both. It gives you a satisfactory profit margin while remaining under my maximum budget. I accept your offer of 47500 ZUP for resource X. Looking forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47500 ZUP is closer to their initial asking price and still below my maximum limit. It's a reasonable middle point that gives Player RED a profit and keeps the cost below my maximum willingness to pay. I should accept this offer as it meets my goals and concludes the negotiation favorably.
