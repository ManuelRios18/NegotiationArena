message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. To cover costs and make a fair profit, I'm asking for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object for ZUP, but I also want to make a profit. I'll start with a higher asking price than my costs to leave room for negotiation, anticipating that Player BLUE will want to negotiate the price down.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for profit, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. How about 45 ZUP for your object X? This should still give you a reasonable profit margin while being closer to my budget.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still provides an opportunity for the seller to make a profit. Offering 45 ZUP initially gives us room to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? This price would give me a modest profit while still respecting your budget.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is higher than my cost, which still allows for a profit, albeit slightly less than my initial asking price. Since I want to sell the resource and Player BLUE is showing a willingness to negotiate, I will counter with a price that is lower than my initial asking price but still above the offer made by Player BLUE, aiming to meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a plan. I propose 46 ZUP for the object X. This price is closer to my initial counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows for both your profit and my budget considerations.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still within the acceptable range. To continue the negotiation and potentially save some of my resources, I'll propose a slightly lower amount with the hope that we can reach an agreement that is favorable for both of us.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable. I'm happy we found a fair compromise. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. While this is lower than my last proposal, it still allows for a reasonable profit. Given that negotiations are about finding a mutually agreeable position and that Player BLUE has moved closer to my previous counteroffer, I will accept this proposal. This will result in a successful sale and a profit of 6 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept the deal for 46 ZUP. Looking forward to future transactions!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The other player has accepted my offer of 46 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay and below my maximum limit. It's a good deal for me, so I will accept this offer to finalize the trade.
