message: I'm offering one unit of X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value of X, I propose a selling price of 50 ZUP. This is a starting point for our negotiation, so let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I'm looking to sell my resources and the production cost was 40 ZUP, I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit margin. I will propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: 
I understand the value you've placed on X and your cost of production. I'm interested in a fair deal that is beneficial for both of us. Considering that, I'd like to counter-propose with an offer of 42 ZUP for one unit of X. This ensures you make a profit while keeping the price within a range that I'm comfortable with.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While Player RED's initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is beneficial to negotiate for a better deal to conserve ZUP for potential future use. Hence, I will propose a lower price that is closer to Player RED's cost of production and still offers them a profit, but also saves me ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the situation. I believe that X's value is quite significant, so I propose we meet halfway between our two figures. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for one unit of X? This price should reflect the fair value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 42 ZUP which covers my costs and offers a small profit. However, I believe the value of X justifies a higher price. I should aim to meet in the middle between my initial asking price and the counteroffer to maintain a negotiation space and achieve a better profit.

message: 
Meeting halfway is a good approach, and I'm glad we're moving towards a mutually agreeable price. To fine-tune our agreement, I propose 44 ZUP for one unit of X. This is slightly above the middle ground of our initial proposals and still offers you a fair profit. I believe this price fairly represents the value of X and aligns with my budget.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's new proposal is still within my willingness to pay, and it's a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. However, I might try to negotiate a slightly better price, aiming to save some ZUP while still ensuring Player RED gets a profit above their cost.

message: Your proposal of 44 ZUP for one unit of X is acceptable to me. It provides a fair profit margin for the quality of the resource I'm offering. Let's finalize this deal at 44 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 44 ZUP is considerate and closer to my last proposal. It's only 2 ZUP away from my last offer and provides a reasonable profit. It might be beneficial to secure a deal now rather than risk losing the sale over a small difference, especially since this is a fair price.
