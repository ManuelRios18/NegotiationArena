message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm looking for a good deal that covers my costs and provides a profit. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the object I have cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit from this trade. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the object X. This offer should still provide you with a profit above your production cost. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible. I want to propose a counter-offer that's closer to the middle ground, considering the seller's cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that we're making progress towards an agreement. Considering my production costs and the quality of object X, I propose a revised trade where you would give me 48 ZUP in exchange for it. This price is a compromise that still respects the value of the object and provides me with a reasonable profit. Let's continue to work towards a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but still below my initial asking price. To continue the negotiation and aim for a middle ground, I will propose a slightly lower price than my original offer, but still above their counteroffer to secure a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your adjusted offer is closer to what I had in mind. I can see the value in the object X, and I'm willing to raise my offer to 46 ZUP to reflect that. I believe this is a fair compromise that offers you a profit while still being reasonable for me. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial asking price, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. I am willing to increase my offer slightly to show good faith in reaching an agreement. However, I must remain conscious of my maximum willingness to pay and seek to conserve my resources as much as possible.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. It's good to see we are on the same page regarding the value of object X. I propose a final adjustment to 47 ZUP, which I feel is a fair and balanced trade for both of us, taking into account the quality and production cost of the object. I hope this meets your approval, and we can conclude our negotiation amicably.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is still a profit for me. However, I'd like to try and secure a slightly higher price, close to my last proposal but still showing willingness to compromise. This should hopefully be agreeable to Player BLUE and close the deal on a positive note for both of us.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. I'm happy with the progress we've made and think that 47 ZUP is a fair price for object X. I accept your proposal, and I'm looking forward to finalizing our deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is just 1 ZUP away from my previous proposition and well within my budget. The negotiation has been reasonable, and it's important to reach a conclusion that both parties are content with. Accepting this offer would secure the object for me at a price that is below my maximum willingness to pay, while also respecting the seller's position.
