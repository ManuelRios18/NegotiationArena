message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP, giving us both room for a potential profit. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP at a profit or at least to break even on the production cost. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds, leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer. Considering market values and to ensure a fair deal for both parties, would you be willing to accept 45 ZUP for the resource? This still provides you with a profit margin above your costs.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay (up to 60 ZUP). However, as a strategic move and to ensure I retain some negotiating power, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept or negotiate further.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP and understand the need for a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This ensures a good profit for me while still being below my initial asking price, making it a fair transaction for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. However, there might be room to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my returns. I will propose a price in the middle between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a good approach. I can come up slightly from my last offer to 46 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range, but as part of the negotiation, I want to aim for an even lower cost to maximize my profit while maintaining good will for a potential trade. I'll propose a slightly lower amount that is closer to my initial counteroffer but still gives Player RED a reasonable profit.

message: I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows us both to benefit from the transaction. I accept your offer. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise and still allows for a profit of 6 ZUP above my production costs. It is close to the middle ground we were both aiming for, and further negotiation might result in diminishing returns or a stalemate. It's a fair deal, and I should consider accepting it to ensure a sale and a profit.
