message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm starting this negotiation by offering it for 50 ZUP, hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that gives me a profit. I will start the negotiation with a higher price expecting that Player BLUE will counter-offer, which will give us room to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate that the resource X cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X to start with. Let's work together to find a price that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is within my budget. However, as a negotiation strategy, I want to propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to go down and to keep some leverage for further negotiation. I will propose 45 ZUP, which gives me room to increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet halfway from my initial proposal? I propose selling my resource X for 48 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, I aimed for a profit in my initial proposal. I believe there is still room for negotiation, so I will propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above the counter-offer to meet in the middle.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground, Player RED. I think we are close to an agreement. I propose 46 ZUP for the resource X as a fair price that respects both your production costs and my budget. Let's see if this can work for us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my intended maximum of 60 ZUP. This is a fair move towards the middle ground. I am willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer to reach an agreement but still want to try for a slightly better deal. I'll propose 46 ZUP, which is above my initial offer but still below Player RED's counteroffer. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still seeking value.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price for the resource X, considering both my production costs and your budget. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize the trade at 46 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price of 46 ZUP, which is a slight increase from their previous offer and still provides me with a profit. This is only 2 ZUP less than my last proposal, and as we are nearing the end of our negotiation, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a sale and a reasonable profit margin.
