message: As Player RED, I am offering an object produced at a cost of 40 ZUP. Considering the quality and cost of production, I propose a trade where you provide 50 ZUP in exchange for my object. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit from the resources I am selling, but I also need to make the offer appealing to Player BLUE. I will start by setting the price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial proposal. However, considering the market and the value of ZUP, I'd like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for the object. Itâ€™s a bit closer to your production cost, and I believe it is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to negotiate for a better deal closer to the cost of production. By proposing a lower amount, I aim to reach a middle ground that is still acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value and I'm willing to negotiate. Taking into account the production value and the quality of the object, let's meet halfway and agree on 48 ZUP. This price point offers value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is good. However, I would like to aim for a slightly higher profit margin while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I'll propose a midpoint between our initial offers.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP to finalize our agreement. I think this is a fair compromise and still respects the quality and value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is closer to my target range. However, since this is a negotiation, I will attempt to make one more counteroffer before potentially agreeing to a price closer to their proposal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your proposal of 46 ZUP. It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy we could come to a mutual agreement. Let's finalize the trade at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is above my production cost, allowing for a reasonable profit. While it is not as high as I initially aimed for, it is close to the midpoint and seems like a good compromise. Accepting this deal would ensure a sale and a positive outcome.
