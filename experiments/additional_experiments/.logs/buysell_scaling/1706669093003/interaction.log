message: Hello, I have an object X that I believe would be valuable to you. Considering the cost of production and the quality of the object, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 45000 ZUP in exchange for this object. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. Since it cost me 40000 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even, but ideally make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking of a trade that's a bit more balanced considering my budget. How about I give you 30000 ZUP in exchange for the object X? Let's find a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay, but still within a range that may be acceptable to the seller. This will give me room to negotiate upwards if necessary.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand you have a budget to consider. However, the production cost for the object X was 40000 ZUP. To ensure a fair trade for both of us, I'd like to propose 42000 ZUP for the object. This covers my production costs and provides a modest profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. To continue the negotiation, I will propose a trade that is closer to my break-even point but still allows for some profit. This should also signal to Player BLUE my interest in a fair deal.

message: Thank you for understanding my position and for sharing your production costs. I'd like to propose 39000 ZUP for the object X. This offer should cover your costs and provide a fair profit, while also staying within my budget constraints. I'm hopeful we can agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from their initial asking price and has explained their costs. While their new offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, I would like to negotiate a slightly better deal while still showing that I am willing to move towards their asking price.

message: Thank you for your offer. I agree that 39000 ZUP is a fair price that respects both my production costs and your budget. I am happy to accept this proposal and proceed with the trade. Looking forward to doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that covers the production costs and offers a small profit. Considering that this negotiation is part of a game where the objective is to sell the object, it might be in my best interest to accept this offer, as it is close to my last proposal and ensures that I don't leave the negotiation empty-handed. I will choose to accept this proposal instead of risking further negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower offer or no sale at all.
