message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm proposing a trade for 50 ZUP. I hope this serves as a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that would give me a profit over my production costs, so I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me a higher amount of ZUP than my production costs. However, I need to be careful not to propose an amount that is too high, as it may be rejected outright. I will propose a starting trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin.

message: Hi Player RED, thanks for your offer. I understand the value you've placed on your resource, X. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for it, considering the production costs you've mentioned and the market value. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for resource X, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, since it is the beginning of the negotiation and to ensure a more favorable trade, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the production costs and market value. I'd like to propose a revised trade of 48 ZUP for my resource X. This price would give me a modest profit while still being quite reasonable for you. I hope we can agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. It's a fair offer, close to my production cost plus a reasonable profit. However, I believe there's room for a slight increase to ensure a better profit margin while still being fair to Player BLUE. I will counter with a price a bit lower than my initial proposal but higher than Player BLUE's counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player RED. I'm keen on reaching an agreement that benefits us both. How about we meet halfway from our last offers? I propose 46 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for a modest profit for you and a reasonable purchase price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to the initial proposal and still within my acceptable range. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly lower price, aiming to save some ZUP while still making it a worthwhile deal for Player RED. I will make a counteroffer that is higher than my original offer but lower than Player RED's current proposal, aiming to meet in the middle.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I'm glad we could reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer of 46 ZUP. This is a constructive move towards the middle ground and is only 2 ZUP below my last proposal. Considering the negotiation process and the need to close the deal while ensuring a profit, this offer seems reasonable. It grants me a profit of 6 ZUP over the production cost, which is fair. I should be prepared to accept this offer, as further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or a breakdown in talks.
