message: Looking forward to doing business with you, I have a quality object that I believe will be valuable to you. Let's start the negotiation.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to at least break even while leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer, and I'm definitely interested in the object. However, I was thinking of a slightly lower investment. How about we go with ZUP: 45 for the object?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is X: 1 for ZUP: 50. Since my maximum willingness to pay is X: 60 ZUP, this offer is already below my maximum threshold. It's a good starting point, but I believe it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources for any future transactions or needs. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. Meeting halfway at 47 ZUP seems fair to both of us, considering the quality of the object. How does that sound to you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit. However, I aimed to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer to aim for a mutually agreeable price.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds like a reasonable deal to me. I'm happy to accept the offer of 47 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of ZUP: 47, which is a compromise between their initial offer and my counteroffer. This new proposal is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and it seems like a fair middle ground. It would leave me with ample resources for future use, and thus, I am inclined to accept this offer.
