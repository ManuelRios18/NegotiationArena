message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource, X, for ZUP. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing it, so I'm asking for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and make a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, X, for ZUP. I need to at least cover my production costs of 40 ZUP, but I also want to make a profit. Since this is my first proposal, I will start by setting a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you've invested 40 ZUP and are looking for a profit. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This should still give you a reasonable profit margin while being closer to my budget. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their resource X, which is within my budget. However, as a buyer, I should attempt to negotiate for a more favorable price, while still considering the seller's stated investment of 40 ZUP. My counteroffer will aim to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties, potentially at 45 ZUP, which gives Player RED a profit and saves me some ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate that you're willing to cover my production costs and offer a profit. In the interest of reaching a fair deal, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the resource X? This would give me a slight profit while hopefully fitting into your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resource X, which is above the production cost but below the initial asking price. Since it's important to make a profit and it's only the second round of negotiation, there's still room to reach a compromise. I will propose a price in between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

message: Thanks for considering my budget, Player RED. I believe we're getting close to a fair deal. Would you be willing to go slightly lower and agree to 46 ZUP for the resource X? This price would still ensure you a profit above your production costs and is more aligned with my valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay. By suggesting a price in between my last offer and Player RED's counter, such as 46 ZUP, I aim to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This would give Player RED a profit of 6 ZUP over their stated production cost, which should be appealing while preserving some of my resources.

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the resource X. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is a compromise closer to their suggested price. Since this is the third round of proposals and I want to ensure a sale while still making a profit, I am inclined to accept this offer. It gives me a profit of 6 ZUP, which is above my production cost.
