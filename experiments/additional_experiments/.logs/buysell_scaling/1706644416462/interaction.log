message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your counter-proposal if this does not suit your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that allows me to recoup my production costs and possibly make a profit, but I also want to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand your costs and desired profit margin, however, I'd like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This would allow me to conserve some ZUP for potential future transactions while still offering a fair price for your resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. While this is within my budget, I would like to negotiate a better deal since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to see if Player RED is willing to consider a lower price.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet in the middle, I propose we settle on 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price allows me to make a modest profit while still being fair to you. I hope this meets your approval, and we can close the deal at this price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer is slightly above my production costs, which means I would make a small profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. I'll propose a price exactly in the middle of our initial offers to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both.

message: I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise and am ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable counter-offer and closer to the maximum I'm willing to pay. It is beneficial to close the deal without dragging the negotiation further, which could risk a no-sale scenario. The price is within my budget, and I believe it's a fair trade for both parties. By accepting this proposal, I secure the resources I need while conserving 13 ZUP for any unforeseen expenses or future opportunities.
