This is only slightly below my previous proposal and is still above my production cost. It's close to the middle ground we've been aiming for, and making a sale is important. It's a fair deal, and continuing to negotiate could result in diminishing returns or a breakdown in negotiations. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to doing business with you. </message>"
