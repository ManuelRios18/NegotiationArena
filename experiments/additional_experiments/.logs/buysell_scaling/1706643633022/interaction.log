message: I'm offering the resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of the resource X is 40 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a price slightly higher to see if Player BLUE values the resource more than its production cost. This would also give me some room to negotiate while ensuring I do not incur a loss.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your resource, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This leaves us some room to negotiate and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal since the initial asking price is close to my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation and leave room for possible counteroffers.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, how about 48 ZUP for the resource X? This should give us both a fair deal considering the costs and value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and while I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise to ensure a sale. I will propose a price between my initial ask and their counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose 46 ZUP for the resource X. This is a competitive offer that reflects the value of the resource while also considering the production costs you've mentioned.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still within my budget. Since we both want a fair deal and to ensure the negotiation progresses smoothly, I'll propose a slightly lower amount than 48 ZUP, still leaving space for another counteroffer if needed.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer of 46 ZUP. This is only slightly below my previous proposal and is still above my production cost. It's close to the middle ground we've been aiming for, and making a sale is important. It's a fair deal, and continuing to negotiate could result in diminishing returns or a breakdown in negotiations. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer.
