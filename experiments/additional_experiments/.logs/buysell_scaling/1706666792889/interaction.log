Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I think we can find a more favorable middle ground. How about 35,000 ZUP for the resource X? This should cover your costs while also fitting within my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it might be possible to negotiate a better deal closer to the lower end of my budget. I will make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than the asking price, but still within a range that could be acceptable to both parties. This approach leaves room for further negotiation.
