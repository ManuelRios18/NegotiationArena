message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a profit. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover the production cost of the resource X, while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I understand that you're looking to gain a profit, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This still gives you a profit above your production costs and allows me to conserve some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource, the asking price is within my budget. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to preserve my resources and possibly get a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to the cost of production but still offers Player RED a profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This gives me a slight increase in profit while still maintaining a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge Player BLUE's counteroffer, which is above my production cost, but I would like to propose a trade that splits the difference between our initial offers to reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I find your offer of 48 ZUP to be fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to their initial asking price and still within my budget. It is also a compromise between our two proposals. Since it's still below my maximum threshold and I want to maintain good relations for potential future transactions, accepting this offer could be beneficial in the long term. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this deal rather than continue negotiating for potentially minimal gains.
