player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

message: Hi Player RED, I understand the need for profit, but I'd like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This still gives you a reasonable profit margin above your production cost, and it's a better deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, but I want to negotiate for a better deal, possibly closer to the production cost, while leaving room for the other player to still make a profit.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer. While I aimed for a sale price of 50 ZUP, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and mine. Let's settle on 47 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both of us. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is just slightly below my initial asking price, but it still covers my production costs and offers a profit. I'm willing to compromise to move the negotiation forward and secure a sale.

message: That sounds like a fair compromise, Player RED. I'm happy to accept the trade for 47 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. It's a fair midpoint, and it's well within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the resources while maintaining a good relationship for potential future trades.
