message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you the resource X for 50 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my production costs and it also includes a reasonable profit margin for the transaction. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my initial offer will aim to cover the production costs of the resource (40 ZUP) and possibly include a profit margin since it's a negotiation. However, I should not set the price too high in order to keep the negotiation open and not deter Player BLUE from engaging in the trade.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for the resource X? This would allow me to conserve some resources for future investments while still providing you with a fair price for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is within my budget, but it's always good practice to try and negotiate a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept it, leaving me with more ZUP for potential future transactions.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need to conserve resources for future investments. I propose a compromise at 47 ZUP for the resource X. This price would give me a fair return on my production costs while also respecting your position. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is acceptable as it covers my production costs and gives me a marginal profit. However, in the spirit of negotiation, I could attempt to meet in the middle between my initial asking price and their offer, aiming for a slightly higher profit margin while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm looking forward to completing this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is very close to my initial counteroffer, and it's still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this proposal will allow me to secure the resource while maintaining a good amount of ZUP for future use. It seems like a fair trade-off, so I will accept this offer.
