message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of your product, and I understand your starting point. However, I would like to propose 4500 ZUP for the object X as a counteroffer. This allows us some flexibility to discuss and come to an agreeable middle ground. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is usually beneficial to start the negotiation by proposing a lower amount to leave room for adjustment and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but still reasonable.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 4500 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand the need for flexibility. I would like to meet you halfway and propose 4800 ZUP for object X. This price ensures that I can cover production costs and also provides you with a quality product at a fair price. Let's aim to make this a win-win situation for both of us.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I value the quality you're providing and your approach to finding a fair price. As a sign of good faith and with the intention of reaching a deal that benefits us both, I propose a new price of 4700 ZUP for object X. I believe this offer is fair and takes into account both our positions. I hope this brings us closer to a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4700
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4800 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. Since this is still within the range that I am willing to pay, and to foster a good trading relationship, it might be in my interest to accept this offer. However, it is often advantageous to negotiate further to see if a slightly better price can be agreed upon, without risking the deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount as my second counteroffer, aiming for a compromise that is more favorable yet still acceptable to Player RED.
