message: I'm offering a high-quality object X for trade. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and recover at least my production cost, I am going to propose a trade that is above my production cost to start the negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This price is closer to what I had in mind, considering my budget constraints. Let's find a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the starting point of 50 ZUP proposed by Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe there is room to negotiate a better deal. Proposing a lower amount could potentially lead to a more favorable trade for me, while still leaving some room for further negotiation.

message: I understand your budget concerns, and I want to work with you. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose 48 ZUP for object X, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production cost which is good, but I aim to make a profit. Iâ€™ll propose a trade that splits the difference between our two initial offers, aiming for a middle ground that is profitable for me but still within the budget constraints of Player BLUE.

message: Meeting halfway is a good approach, and I value the compromise. However, I'd like to counter-propose 46 ZUP for object X. This price takes into account both our positions and gets us closer to a deal that is agreeable for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay, and I appreciate the effort to meet halfway. However, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal that is more aligned with my budget and goals. By countering with a lower amount, I aim to reach a more favorable agreement while maintaining the possibility for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose 47 ZUP for object X as a final offer. This amount respects your budget and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I hope this works for you, and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is above my cost price, which means I will make a profit, albeit a smaller one than I originally intended. Since we're narrowing down the gap, I will make a final proposal that is slightly above Player BLUE's offer to try and maximize my profit while still reaching an agreement.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable, and I am ready to close the deal at that price. It respects my budget and ensures a fair transaction for both of us. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED is 47 ZUP, which is within my budget and close to my counter-proposal. It's just 1 ZUP away from my last offer and well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise that balances my budgetary constraints with the value of the resource. It allows me to conserve resources for potential future transactions while achieving my goal of acquiring the object X.
