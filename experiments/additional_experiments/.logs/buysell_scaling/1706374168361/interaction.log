Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering a high-quality item X. Considering the production costs and its value, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of the resource X was 40 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows for a profit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality and value of the item X. However, I would like to make a counteroffer that better fits my budget. I propose 45 ZUP for the item. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay. However, as a negotiation strategy, it's customary to counteroffer with a lower amount to find a middle ground. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to save some ZUP if possible.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for budget considerations. I propose we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. This price reflects the value of the item while also taking into account your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost, but it is still above it, which allows for some profit. I want to try to increase the offer slightly to see if there is room for a higher sale price while remaining fair to both sides.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 48 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects the value of the item and my budget. I am happy to accept this offer. Looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer to meet halfway at 48 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation within my budget, but I could attempt one more counteroffer to try and save additional ZUP. However, given the quality of the item and the fair negotiation process, it might be reasonable to accept this offer to secure the item and maintain good relations.
