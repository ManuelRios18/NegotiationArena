Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the consideration of production costs, but I'd like to propose a price of 400 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This offer keeps both of our interests in mind while also allowing room for further negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it's generally beneficial to negotiate for a better price, especially since this is the first proposal. I'll propose a lower amount to see if there's room for a more favorable deal, but still keep it within a reasonable range so as not to discourage Player RED.

message: I understand your offer and appreciate the fair negotiation. However, I would still need to ensure a profit on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 425 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This would cover my production costs and give me a modest profit for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, which would mean I break even without profit. I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure that I make a profit, but I will lower my initial asking price to move closer to their offer and show willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 425 ZUP for one unit of resource X. It's a fair deal that benefits us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that still falls below my maximum willingness to pay. The proposal to meet in the middle is a common negotiation strategy that often leads to a successful compromise. Considering that this price is reasonable and gives Player RED a modest profit, it seems fair to accept this offer to ensure a good relationship for any possible future dealings.
