message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. However, I would like to counter with a trade where I give you 350,000 ZUP for your resource X. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600,000 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate a better deal to preserve my resources. I'll counter with a lower offer to open negotiations and hopefully arrive at a mutually agreeable price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for negotiation, but 350,000 ZUP is below my production cost. How about we meet halfway? I propose 425,000 ZUP for my resource X. This should be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept that. I will counter with a value that is above my cost but lower than my initial proposal to try and meet in the middle.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. In the spirit of fair negotiation, I'd like to propose a revised offer of 375,000 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this offer is closer to a middle ground that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 375000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price that is still below my maximum willingness to pay, yet closer to their initial offer. This suggests there may be room for a bit more negotiation, but I should also consider that this may be approaching their bottom line. I'll propose a slightly increased amount from my initial counteroffer, which is still a good deal for me and may be acceptable to them.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production cost. However, I want to close the deal, so I will make a final proposal that is just above my cost, showing my willingness to finalize the trade while still securing a modest profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept the trade of 410,000 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I look forward to concluding our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's also a relatively small increment from their previous offer, indicating they are nearing their lowest acceptable price. Given that I am still well within my budget, accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation for me, securing the resource at a price below my maximum limit.
