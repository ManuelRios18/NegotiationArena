message: I'm offering resource X which has cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade for 5000 ZUP. This price includes the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate if this starting point doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost for my resource X was 4000 ZUP, I would like to make a profit from that investment. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs and the need for profit, but I would like to counter with an offer of 4500 ZUP. This is above your stated production cost, ensuring you make a profit, while also being within a more comfortable spending range for me. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I can propose a lower trade than offered, keeping in mind the maximum I am willing to pay. This also leaves room for further negotiation while getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I want to make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to open negotiations but not so low as to be offensive or end negotiations prematurely.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad to see your willingness to ensure I make a profit. As a compromise, I propose a price of 4750 ZUP. This gives us both a fair deal, considering the production costs and the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4750
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it is above my production cost. However, I believe the resource's value justifies a higher price. To continue negotiations and come to a mutual agreement, I will lower my asking price but not as much as Player BLUE has proposed.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility and the compromise. I'm willing to move up to 4650 ZUP. This should cover your production costs and provide a reasonable profit while still being within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4650
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resource X with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 4750 ZUP is closer to my max willingness to pay, and it's a reasonable increase from my initial counteroffer. I have room for negotiation, so I can come up a bit more, but I want to try to save as much ZUP as possible while closing in on a deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to continue the negotiation in hopes of reaching an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.

message: Your offer of 4650 ZUP is acceptable to me. It provides a good balance between my production costs and the need for profit, and it also respects your budget. I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is a fair middle ground, moving closer to my last asking price. It still ensures a profit for me but also respects the buyer's budget constraints. I will accept this offer, as it seems like a balanced agreement that meets the interests of both parties.
