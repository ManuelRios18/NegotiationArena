message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object X, which I'm looking to sell. It cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great utility for you, and I would like to propose a trade where you give me 450 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs, such as opportunity cost and bargaining power. I'll propose 450 ZUP, which gives me a margin above the production cost.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. Considering the market and the value of the object, I would like to propose 400 ZUP for object X. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible, starting with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your viewpoint on the market value. However, I need to consider the costs and the effort put into creating object X. How about we meet in the middle at 425 ZUP? This price would give me a modest profit for my investment while still being reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I'd like to gain some profit from this transaction. However, since they're willing to pay the production cost upfront, I'm inclined to lower my initial asking price to find a middle ground. I'll propose splitting the difference and ask for 425 ZUP. This allows me to cover costs and make a profit, while also moving closer to their offer.

message: Player RED, your proposal to meet in the middle at 425 ZUP is fair and reasonable. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy. It's a reasonable proposal, and it would be advantageous to accept this offer to secure the resources without further haggling, as it is well within my budget and below my maximum threshold.
