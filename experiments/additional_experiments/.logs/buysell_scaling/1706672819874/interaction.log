message: I'm offering an object of X which has cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I believe that 450000 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation, considering the quality and value of X. Let's discuss further and find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by setting a price slightly above my production costs to open up negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the object. I will propose a trade for 450000 ZUP to allow room for negotiation but still aim for a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 420000 ZUP for the object X. This is still above your cost of production and should provide a fair profit margin, while also respecting my budget constraints. Let's work together to find a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, there is room for negotiation to reach a more favorable trade for me. A counteroffer less than the asking price but still within a reasonable range might be accepted considering the cost of production.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. I believe we can meet halfway between our two proposals. How about 435000 ZUP for the object X? This should give us both a satisfactory deal, providing me with a reasonable profit and staying within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is still above my production costs, which is a good sign. However, as I aimed for a higher profit, I will propose a compromise between my initial asking price and their offer. This should help us to find a mutually agreeable price.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and meeting me halfway. I agree that 435000 ZUP is a fair price that aligns with both our interests. I'm ready to proceed with this deal for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is a fair middle point between our initial offers, and it is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This offer seems reasonable and well justified, as it provides a profit for Player RED and a good deal for me. Accepting this offer would secure the object X within my budget and end the negotiation on good terms.
