message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. Considering the production costs and the value of X, I propose a trade where you give me 450000 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. I need to recover at least my production costs of 400000 ZUP, but I would also like to make a profit. I will start the negotiation with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value you've placed on your resource X. However, considering the market conditions and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 400000 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 450000 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is important to negotiate to try and get a better deal if possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to consider it, but still offer a price that gives them some room to negotiate upwards.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, but I must also consider the need to make a profit. Let's meet halfway between our two figures. I propose 425000 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges both the production value and the market worth.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production costs. However, I am aiming to make a profit from this sale. I'll propose a slightly reduced price from my initial offer, but still above my production costs to ensure profit and leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your new proposal of 425000 ZUP is quite reasonable. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 410000 ZUP for resource X. This price should cover your production costs and allow for profit while also respecting my budget constraints. I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new figure of 425000 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is closer to the initial proposal, which shows a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this proposal would leave room within my budget, but I will attempt one more negotiation step to see if we can settle on an even lower price that is favorable to me but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED.

message: I'm glad to see we're making progress in our negotiation. Your offer of 410000 ZUP is getting closer to a number that works for both of us. To finalize our agreement and ensure a fair deal, I propose a trade of 417500 ZUP for resource X. This should provide a modest profit for me while still being within your budget. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 417500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal by offering 410000 ZUP. This offer gives me a profit above production costs, which is my goal. However, I will try for one more increment, aiming for a slightly higher profit margin, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. Your last proposal of 417500 ZUP for resource X is a fair price, and I am happy to accept this offer. I believe this deal is in the interest of both parties, and I look forward to potential future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest counteroffer from Player RED is 417500 ZUP, which shows a continued interest in reaching an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. This price is very close to the previous one I proposed and is still well under my maximum willingness to pay. Given that the negotiation is converging and I want to maintain good relations for potential future transactions, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
