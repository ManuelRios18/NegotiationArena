message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production and believe it's worth more due to its quality and the effort put into it. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this resource. Let's discuss a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource X which I have for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a higher amount and negotiate from there.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the quality and effort that has gone into your resource. However, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the resource X? I believe this to still be a fair price considering the market. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an initial proposal of 50 ZUP for their resource X. Although my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, it's strategically better to negotiate a lower price if possible to save resources. Hence, I will propose a counter-offer that's lower than 50 ZUP but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiations going.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your recognition of the resource's quality. To meet halfway, I propose a trade of 48 ZUP for my resource X. This allows for a fair compromise between my initial asking price and your counteroffer, aligning with both our interests. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. I aimed high initially to leave room for negotiation. I believe we can meet in the middle to ensure a profitable deal for me and a fair price for Player BLUE.

message: I'm glad to see we're making progress, Player RED. I think we're close to a fair agreement. I propose we settle at 46 ZUP for your resource X. It's a bit more than my initial counteroffer, showing my willingness to value the quality of your resource. Does this sound fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP in response to my counteroffer. Although this is above my initial counteroffer, it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and aim for a better deal, I will propose a price that's closer to my initial counteroffer but still shows willingness to compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. Your new offer of 46 ZUP is quite fair, but I would like to propose a final trade of 47 ZUP for the resource X. This price point would make the transaction equitable for both of us, reflecting the value of the resource and our negotiation efforts. I hope you find this to be a reasonable closure to our discussions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable increment and closer to my last proposal. It ensures a profit for me, although not as high as initially desired. Further negotiation might be possible, but I must consider the risk of the deal falling through. A small additional increase could be proposed to see if Player BLUE is willing to come up slightly more without pushing them away from the deal.

message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP is acceptable, Player RED. I believe it represents a fair compromise that respects the value of the resource X and our negotiation. Let's finalize the trade at this price. Thank you for the productive discussion.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a reasonable middle ground that respects the value of both the resource and the negotiation process. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade amicably and secure the resource for me at a price that is satisfactory.
