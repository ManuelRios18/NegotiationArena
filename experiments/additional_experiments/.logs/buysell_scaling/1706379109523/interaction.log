message: I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trading price of 4500 ZUP, hoping to engage in negotiation. Let's find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object X, which is 4000 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the need for profit. I appreciate your starting offer, but I would like to propose a trade for 4200 ZUP. This is above your production cost and should provide a fair profit margin for you. I believe this could be a good starting point for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 4500 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to ensure a better deal, I would like to propose a counteroffer that is closer to their production cost, but still provides them with a profit margin. This might also leave some room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer of 4200 ZUP. I'm glad to see we're in the same ballpark. To meet halfway, I propose 4350 ZUP for the object X. This price should give us both a fair deal, considering the production costs and the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it is above my production costs. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will propose a price in the middle between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counter-offer.

message: Your counteroffer of 4350 ZUP is fair and acceptable. I am happy to proceed with this trade as it represents a good value for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at 4350 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 4350 ZUP is reasonable and nearing a price point that I am willing to pay. It's within my budget and close enough to the production cost to ensure they make a profit, while not exceeding the value I've set for the object. I will accept this offer as it is a mutually beneficial deal.
