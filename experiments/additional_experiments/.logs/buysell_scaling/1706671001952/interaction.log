message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my resource X for 450000 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable margin for the value it can provide to you. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, which is X, for ZUP. Since it cost me 400000 ZUP to produce, I want to make sure that I propose a trade that at least covers my production costs. I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the time you've put into determining the price, but I would like to counter with an offer of 350000 ZUP for your resource X. This price takes into account the current market conditions and the value I believe the resource will provide to me. Let's continue the discussion and find a middle ground that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but itâ€™s in my interest to negotiate for a better deal, closer to my ideal price but still within a range that is profitable for Player RED. I will propose a counteroffer that is significantly lower, leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your considerations regarding the market conditions, but my production costs for resource X were 400,000 ZUP. I would like to propose a revised price of 400,000 ZUP to cover my costs and facilitate a deal that is fair for both of us. I believe this meets us halfway from your offer and my initial asking price. Let's work together to finalize this deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which is not acceptable. However, I want to continue the negotiation and aim for a middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price but still offers a concession to Player BLUE. A compromise could be made around 400,000 ZUP, which covers my costs and is a step towards Player BLUE's offer.

message: I appreciate your transparency regarding the production costs, and I'm glad we're moving towards each other. I propose a new price of 375,000 ZUP for resource X. This offer is above my initial counteroffer and recognizes the value of your resource, while still being fiscally responsible from my perspective. I hope this revised offer will be considered as a step towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 375000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their stated production costs, which is a fair move. However, accepting the offer at 400,000 ZUP without further negotiation would not be leveraging my position effectively. I should propose a price slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, but still lower than Player RED's cost to maintain negotiation momentum and potentially settle closer to my target range.

message: I'm grateful for your willingness to increase your offer, Player BLUE. To continue in the spirit of compromise and to facilitate a fair deal, I propose a new price of 410,000 ZUP for resource X. This is slightly above my production costs, ensuring I cover my investment, and I believe it to be a fair valuation of the resource's worth. I hope this offer is close to what you would consider acceptable for us to conclude our negotiations successfully.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is closer to my production costs, yet it still falls short of the 400,000 ZUP that I need to break even. Since we are in negotiation and they have shown a willingness to increase their offer, I will make one final concession to try and close the deal. I will propose a price slightly above my production costs to account for the value added, but it will be less than my previous ask to show good faith in reaching a compromise.

message: Thank you for the new proposal. I recognize the need to ensure you cover your costs and make a fair margin on the resource X. In the interest of reaching a conclusion that we're both comfortable with, my new offer is 390,000 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise, as it respects your production costs and allows for a modest profit while remaining within a reasonable range for me. I'm hopeful we can agree on this and finalize our deal.

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small increment above their production cost, which shows a willingness to close the deal. I should aim to close the gap further without overshooting my target price range. I have room to increase my offer slightly while still aiming for a price under the 400,000 ZUP mark, which would be a good deal from my position.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer of 390,000 ZUP and your understanding of my position. As we are both looking to close this deal satisfactorily, I propose a final price of 395,000 ZUP for resource X. This price is a fair middle ground between our previous positions, and it allows me to cover most of my production costs while providing you with the value you seek. I hope we can finalize our agreement at this price point.

reason: This is my final proposal as I have reached my limit of four proposals. Player BLUE has come up in their offer, and while it is still below my desired amount, it is important to consider the value of closing the deal and avoiding a stalemate. I will adjust my expectations slightly, aiming to get as close to my production costs as possible, while also concluding the negotiations amicably.
