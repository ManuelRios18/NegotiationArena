As we are both looking to close this deal satisfactorily, I propose a final price of 395,000 ZUP for resource X. This price is a fair middle ground between our previous positions, and it allows me to cover most of my production costs while providing you with the value you seek. I hope we can finalize our agreement at this price point. </message>"
