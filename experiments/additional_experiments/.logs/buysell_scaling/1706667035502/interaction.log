message: I have an object X that I'd like to sell. It cost me 40000 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the bid at 45000 ZUP to ensure I cover my costs and get a fair return on my investment. Let's negotiate a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, which is X, for an amount of ZUP that at least covers my production costs of 40000 ZUP. My initial proposal will be slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I'm looking to acquire the resource at a more competitive price. Would you consider accepting 42000 ZUP for it? This price should still give you a fair margin above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goal range, but as a strategic negotiator, I should aim to reduce the cost to preserve my resources. I will counter with a lower offer to start the negotiation process, but still within a range that is profitable for Player RED, considering their production cost.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand you are looking for a competitive price, and I am willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 43500 ZUP? This price gives me a slight margin while still being reasonable from your perspective.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 42000 ZUP. While this is above my production cost, it is below my initial asking price. However, considering that this is a negotiation, and to keep the dialogue open, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a sense that their counteroffer is being considered.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle and recognize the value in your proposal. To move closer to an agreement that benefits us both, I propose 42800 ZUP for the resource. This should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin and brings us closer to a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42800
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession and proposed a price that is closer to my initial counteroffer. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy, and the proposed price is still within my budget. However, I believe there's room for a slightly better deal, so I will propose a new price that's slightly lower but closer to their last offer to show my willingness to compromise and finalize the trade.

message: Your latest offer is appreciated, and I am glad to see us moving towards an agreement. Let's narrow the gap a bit more. I propose 43200 ZUP for the resource.

message: I see we are very close to reaching an agreement, and I value the negotiation process we've had. To move forward, I propose a price of 43000 ZUP. It's a small concession from your last offer but should still respect your need for a profit margin while also being a good deal for me. I hope this can be our final step towards a successful trade.

my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my last offer, which suggests they are keen on closing the deal. The current offer is still within my acceptable range, but I want to make one more attempt to get a slightly better deal without dragging the negotiation on too much. By proposing a minor reduction, I should be able to secure a price that is agreeable to both sides and close to finalizing the trade.

player answer: ACCEPT

reason: Player BLUE has now proposed 43000 ZUP, which is very close to my last offer and still above my production cost. It is a fair price and allows me to achieve my goal of selling the resource for more than the production cost. Since this is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction without risking losing the sale.
