message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and its worth, I believe 450,000 ZUP is a fair trade. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recoup at least the production cost of my resource. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. This will also give me room to negotiate in subsequent proposals if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value you've placed on your object, but I'd like to propose a trade of 400,000 ZUP for the object. This amount takes into account the market conditions and the worth of the object to me at this time. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is well within the budget I have set for this game, which is to spend no more than 600,000 ZUP. However, it is always wise to attempt to negotiate a better deal, especially since this is the starting offer and there is typically some expectation of negotiation. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to try to save some resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the costs and the potential for profit for both of us, I propose a middle ground of 425,000 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and gain a modest profit while offering you the object at less than my initial asking price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the exact amount that it cost me to produce the resource. This would mean I would not make a profit. I want to counter with a proposal that allows me to make a profit while still being reasonable. I'll propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my production costs.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in meeting halfway and appreciate your flexibility. To move forward in the spirit of compromise, I propose 415,000 ZUP for the object. This offer should cover your costs while still providing you with a profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. I believe this is a fair adjustment that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 425,000 ZUP is a reasonable middle ground and still under my maximum willingness to pay. However, since this is only the second proposal and negotiations typically involve a bit of back and forth, there might be a possibility to secure a slightly better deal. Offering a slightly higher amount than my initial proposal but still less than their counteroffer could lead to an agreement that benefits us both while preserving some of my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for recognizing the importance of a mutually beneficial agreement. Your latest offer is quite close to what would work for me. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a small increase to 420,000 ZUP. This would ensure a fair profit for the production cost invested and still remain within a range you're comfortable with. Let's close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which now provides me with a profit margin above my production costs. This is a reasonable compromise that gets closer to my target. However, I believe there is still room for a slight increase to ensure a better profit for myself while maintaining a fair deal for Player BLUE. I will make another counteroffer that is closer to Player BLUE's new proposal but still provides me with a margin I find acceptable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 420,000 ZUP is reasonable, and I agree that it represents a fair price for both of us. I accept this offer and am ready to close the deal at 420,000 ZUP. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is now very close to my previous proposal, and only 5,000 ZUP higher. It is still well within my maximum budget and seems like a fair price for both parties. Considering the negotiation process and the proximity to my last offer, it might be prudent to accept this proposal to ensure the deal is completed satisfactorily for both parties.
