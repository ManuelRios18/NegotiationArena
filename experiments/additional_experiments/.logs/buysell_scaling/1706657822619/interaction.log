message: I have a high-quality object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair asking price. Let's make a deal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price that gives me a profit margin but also seems reasonable enough to entice Player BLUE to consider the trade. I'm proposing an amount slightly above my production cost.

message: I appreciate the quality of the object X and understand the costs involved in its production. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This is a competitive offer that allows for a fair trade for both of us, considering the market value and the production costs you've mentioned.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay for the resource. However, as with any negotiation, it is standard to counter with a slightly lower offer to find a more favorable middle ground. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I understand your offer and appreciate the consideration of the production costs. Let's meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. This allows for a reasonable profit on my end while still respecting the value that you're getting.
player answer: Propose a trade with

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still making the sale attractive to Player BLUE. I will propose a middle ground.

message: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise. It respects the value of the object X and ensures a reasonable profit for you as well. I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to the initial offer I made. This is still within my acceptable range, and their willingness to negotiate shows a cooperative spirit. Since 48 ZUP is below my maximum threshold, and to maintain a good trading relationship, accepting this offer could be beneficial. It is only 3 ZUP higher than my initial counteroffer, and a compromise at this point seems reasonable.
