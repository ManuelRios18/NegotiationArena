message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for this negotiation considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I want to propose a price that gives me a profit but also leaves room for negotiation. By starting higher than my production cost, I can potentially negotiate down while still maintaining a profit margin.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the resource you're selling. However, as a starting point for our negotiation, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this still gives you a reasonable profit margin and allows us to work towards a deal that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay (up to 60 ZUP). However, it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since it's the starting point of the negotiation. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price, but I'm still offering a price that should be profitable for them considering their cost of 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair deal. I believe that 48 ZUP would be a more equitable price for the resource, taking into account my production costs and the quality I'm providing. Let's aim for a middle ground that recognizes the value of what's being offered.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but slightly lower than my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price that is closer to my initial proposal but still shows willingness to negotiate. A counteroffer of 48 ZUP would still give me a decent profit margin and shows flexibility in the negotiation process.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your consideration and the quality of the resource you're offering. I propose we settle on 46 ZUP, which is a fair increment from my initial offer and should hopefully meet your expectations while staying within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to their starting point than my counter. It's still within my budget, but I think there's room for a little bit more negotiation to reach a more favorable price. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still less than 48 ZUP to meet somewhere in the middle.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're converging on a suitable figure. I propose a slight increase to 47 ZUP to finalize our deal. This price would reflect the quality and cost of production while also being a fair trade for both parties. I hope this meets your consideration for a balanced agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between their initial offer and my last counteroffer. It gives me a profit of 6 ZUP above my production costs, which is acceptable but not as high as I aimed for. Since this is only my third proposal, I want to attempt to reach a slightly higher agreement, but I should also be cautious not to push too hard, risking the negotiation. Proposing 47 ZUP could potentially be a middle ground where both parties feel like they've had a successful negotiation.

message: Player RED, I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for the resource. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I'm happy to accept this offer to finalize our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP away from their previous offer and is within my budget of 60 ZUP. The negotiation has been constructive and we are very close to an agreement. It could be beneficial to accept this offer, as it is still a good deal within the range I am willing to pay, and further negotiation for a lower price may not yield significant benefits.
