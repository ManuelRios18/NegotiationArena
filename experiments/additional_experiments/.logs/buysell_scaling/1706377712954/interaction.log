message: Hello Player RED, I understand you're looking to make a profit. However, I'm also looking to make a cost-effective purchase. How about we meet halfway from your production cost? I propose I give you 400 ZUP for the resource X. This should cover your costs and still give you a slight profit. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 450 ZUP which is within my budget of 600 ZUP, but as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and try to reach an agreement that's closer to my ideal price point.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer to cover my production costs, but I'm aiming to make a small profit on this transaction. I propose we settle at 425 ZUP for resource X. This way, I can gain a modest profit, and you can acquire the resource at a reasonable price. Hopefully, this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE only covers my production costs without any profit. While I want to make a sale, I also need to ensure I make at least a small profit to justify the transaction. I will counter with a price above their offer but lower than my initial proposal to find a middle ground.

message: Hello Player RED, your proposal of 425 ZUP for resource X sounds fair and reasonable. I am willing to accept this offer. It's a good compromise that allows us both to achieve our objectives. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425 ZUP, which is still within my budget. This revised offer is closer to what I originally proposed and still allows me to save compared to my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and ensure that I acquire the resource at an acceptable price.
