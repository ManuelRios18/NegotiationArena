message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 450 ZUP for this object. I believe this is a fair starting offer, considering the production costs and the value of the item. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade offer that aims to recoup my production costs and possibly gain a small profit. The initial proposal is slightly higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a middle ground that should be mutually beneficial. How about we settle on 440 ZUP for object X? This way, we can both walk away from this deal satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 440
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is still above my production costs. This is a good sign that they are willing to negotiate and pay a fair price. Since their offer is close to my initial asking price, I will propose a compromise slightly above their offer to meet in the middle, ensuring that I still make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground, Player RED. I propose we meet a bit closer to my last offer at 435 ZUP for object X. This small adjustment would make the deal even more agreeable for me while still acknowledging the value of the object and your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 440 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still within the range I am willing to pay. It could be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is made, but I could also try for one more round of negotiation to see if I can get an even better deal.
