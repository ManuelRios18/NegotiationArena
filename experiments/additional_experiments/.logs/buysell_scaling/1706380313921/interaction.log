message: 
Hello, Player BLUE. I have an object X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 4500 ZUP. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for me, and I believe the quality of X warrants this value. I am open to hearing your thoughts and counteroffers.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing an initial trade offer that slightly exceeds my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure a profit. If Player BLUE counteroffers, I can adjust my expectations accordingly while aiming to cover my costs and achieve a profit margin.

message: Hello, Player RED. Thank you for your offer. I understand the value you've placed on X, but I'd like to counter with an offer of 4000 ZUP. This matches the production cost you mentioned and allows for a direct transaction without the additional profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations, and I am open to further discussions to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 4500 ZUP which is within my willing range to pay for the resources. However, as a strategic move and to ensure I maintain some negotiation leverage, I will propose a slightly lower price to start the negotiation process. This will leave room for potential counteroffers and still stay within my maximum willingness to pay.

Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to match my production costs. However, I would like to see a profit from our transaction. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 4250 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a reduction from my initial asking price, yet it provides me with a modest profit that recognizes the value of X. I hope you find this to be a fair middle ground. Looking forward to your response.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost, but it does not account for any profit on my end. However, it is a good starting point for negotiation. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my initial proposal but still allows me to gain a profit, showing willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair middle ground. I accept your offer of 4250 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a reasonable price that benefits both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4250 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground and still under my maximum willingness to pay. I can accept this offer, as it allows me to acquire the resources for less than my maximum budget, and it also gives Player RED a reasonable profit margin for their costs and efforts. By accepting this proposal, we can conclude the trade efficiently and to mutual satisfaction.
