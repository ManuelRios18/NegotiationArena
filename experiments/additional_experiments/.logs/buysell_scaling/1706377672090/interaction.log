message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object 'X' that cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it at a fair price that covers my costs and provides me with a profit for my efforts. Would you be interested in acquiring it for 450 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting the price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation while also aiming for a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. I am interested in the object but would like to propose a counteroffer of 425 ZUP. This is above your cost and should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin. Are you willing to consider this new proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600 ZUP. However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate a better price that's closer to the production cost to maintain a stronger position and possibly save resources for future transactions. I will propose a counteroffer that is above their cost but below their asking price to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to go above my production cost. To meet halfway between our initial figures, I propose a trade where I give you 'X' and you give me 435 ZUP. This should yield a reasonable profit for me while still being a fair deal for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production costs, which allows for a profit, but I aim to negotiate for a higher amount closer to my initial asking price. A middle ground between the two offers would be beneficial.

Turn: 1
message: I agree that 435 ZUP is a fair compromise between our initial proposals. I am happy to accept this offer, as it is a reasonable price for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade at 435 ZUP for 'X'.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 435 ZUP, which is still within my budget. This counteroffer is close to the midpoint between our initial proposals, showing some willingness to negotiate. To maintain good trading relations and secure the object for a fair price, it might be beneficial to accept this offer. However, I could attempt one more counteroffer to see if there's any further room for reduction, but this could risk the goodwill established thus far. Considering this, I'll accept their offer as it is fair and below my maximum willingness to pay.
