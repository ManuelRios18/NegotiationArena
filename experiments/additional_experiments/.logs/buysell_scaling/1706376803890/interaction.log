message: I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the costs I've incurred. How do you feel about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to start with an offer that gives me a profit margin while still being open to negotiation. I will propose a price slightly above my costs to see how Player BLUE values the object.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting point. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade that might be more aligned with the market value of the resource. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still a good strategy to negotiate for a better price. I will propose a lower amount of ZUP in exchange for the object to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I understand your point about the market value; however, I need to cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. Would you consider meeting halfway at 425 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that matches my production costs, which doesn't provide me with any profit. I will counter with a proposal that meets halfway between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer, allowing room for some profit while still being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair compromise. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade at 425 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Meeting halfway at 425 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a favorable position for me. It's reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the trade goes through, avoiding the risk of a breakdown in negotiations, while still staying well under my budget.
