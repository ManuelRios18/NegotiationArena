message: I have a quality resource available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe that starting our negotiation at 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair proposition. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to make a profit from the resources I have invested in, I will start by proposing a trade that is higher than my production cost. This will allow room for negotiation while aiming for a profitable deal.

message: Thank you for the offer. I value the quality of the resource you're selling, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would allow me to manage my resources more effectively while still ensuring you make a profit on the sale.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my budget since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it's advantageous to negotiate a better deal if possible, so I aim to propose a slightly lower price to conserve my resources while still making a reasonable offer.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need to manage your resources. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This ensures a fair profit for me while also respecting the value you see in the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price and still allows for a profit, albeit slightly less than desired. To come to an agreement that is beneficial for both parties and to move the negotiation forward, I'll propose a price that is in between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I believe 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a fair compromise. I accept this trade and look forward to future transactions with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is closer to my upper limit but still acceptable. Considering the need to reach an agreement and the value of the resource, I am inclined to accept this offer as it is a fair middle ground and allows me to acquire the resource below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer will conclude the trade favorably for both parties.
