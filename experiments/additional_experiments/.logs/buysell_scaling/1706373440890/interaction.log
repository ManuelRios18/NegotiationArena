message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my resource X for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my objective is to recover at least my production cost of 40 ZUP, but I would also like to make a profit. I will start with a higher initial proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal for me. This will also leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I can understand your position, but I would like to counter with 48 ZUP for my resource X. This price fairly compensates for the production costs and provides me with a modest profit. Let's work towards an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To continue the negotiation and come to a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above the counteroffer to maintain a profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player RED. To move closer to an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to 46 ZUP for your resource X. This is a step up from my initial offer and still provides you with a fair return.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. While the offer is reasonable, it's common to negotiate further to see if we can meet at an even more favorable price for me. I'll make a counteroffer that's between my initial offer and Player RED's latest proposal.

message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player BLUE. I value our negotiation and in the spirit of reaching a prompt agreement, I am willing to adjust my price slightly. I propose 47 ZUP for my resource X. This should cover my costs and allow for a fair profit. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new proposal of 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Since this is above my production cost, it yields a profit, albeit smaller than desired. To expedite the negotiation and secure a deal that is acceptable to both parties, I will propose a final trade amount closer to their offer, but still aiming for a bit more profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to come to a mutually beneficial agreement, Player RED. Your offer of 47 ZUP for your resource X is acceptable to me. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from my last offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It seems we are close to an agreement, and making a small concession might help close the deal efficiently while maintaining a good relationship for potential future transactions.
