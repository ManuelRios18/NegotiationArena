message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an initial trade proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation, while still offering a fair deal to Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation. I will propose 45 ZUP which gives us space to meet somewhere in the middle if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. What do you think about meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP for object X? This would cover my production costs and provide a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs. This is a good sign that they are willing to negotiate. I'm going to propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, which should be beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. I propose we come a bit closer to my counteroffer, at 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this price is closer to a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a higher price than my initial counteroffer, but it is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I still have room to negotiate while ensuring I don't exceed the maximum amount I'm willing to spend. I will make a slight increase in my offer to show willingness to compromise, but I will still aim to keep the cost below Player RED's latest proposal, suggesting 47 ZUP.

message: Player BLUE, I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable offer very close to my previous proposal. This price gives me a decent profit margin while remaining fair for both sides. Since it's also above my production costs, it seems like a good deal to accept.
