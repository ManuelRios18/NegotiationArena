message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an excellent resource X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer you this resource for 4500 ZUP, ensuring quality and value for your investment. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am starting with a proposal that aims to recover the cost of production for my resource. I want to start at a point slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation, but not so high as to discourage Player BLUE from engaging in the trade. Therefore, I will propose a trade with a price of 4500 ZUP, which gives me a margin above my costs.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, to accommodate my budget and investment plans, I would like to counter-propose with 4000 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 4500 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as a strategic measure and to ensure I get the best possible deal, I will propose a lower amount. This is my first proposal, and I aim to approach the maximum willingness to pay gradually, to possibly save on resources.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your counter-proposal. I understand your budgetary constraints and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 4250 ZUP for the resource X? This price would allow me to cover my costs and still offer you the resource at a reasonable price. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a trade that matches my production cost. While this would not yield any profit, it would allow me to recover my investment. However, since this is a negotiation, I'd like to counter with a proposal that splits the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still seeking to achieve a modest profit for the resource.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To further our negotiation, I propose a price of 4100 ZUP for the resource X. This is a step up from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4100
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4250 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counter-offer. This shows willingness to negotiate. I still have some room within my maximum willingness to pay, and I would like to propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer but still below RED's current proposal to find a middle ground that could be more acceptable to both of us. This is my second proposal, leaving me with two more proposals if needed.

message: Thank you for your updated offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we are moving closer to an agreement. To reflect my appreciation of your commitment, I'm willing to adjust my expectation to 4200 ZUP for the resource X. This price accounts for the value of the resource while still being considerate of your budget. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step towards a deal. The offer is now slightly above my production costs, but I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price to account for my efforts and the value of the resource. A counteroffer of 4200 ZUP would be closer to my initial proposal while still showing my flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This would give me a small profit margin and is likely close to Player BLUE's maximum willingness to pay, given the increments of their offers.

message: Player RED, I am thankful for your continued flexibility in this negotiation. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our agreement, I propose a price of 4150 ZUP for resource X. This adjustment splits the difference between our last two offers, and I believe it is a fair price point for both of us. I am hopeful that this offer meets your approval, and we can conclude this deal to our mutual benefit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4150
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4200 ZUP, which is very close to the previous offer I made. There is a small gap between our offers, and we seem to be converging on a price that is satisfactory to both parties. Given that this is my third proposal, I want to get closer to a price we can both agree on without exhausting my last proposal. I believe offering a price midway between my last offer and RED's current proposal could be a successful strategy to close the deal.

message: Player BLUE, I am pleased with your willingness to find common ground. I accept your offer of 4150 ZUP for resource X, and I'm looking forward to concluding this deal. Thank you for your fair and respectful negotiation. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a fair offer that is very close to my previous proposal. Given that this is my last allowed proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I want to ensure that the negotiation ends successfully. Accepting this offer allows me to make a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended, but it also ensures that the deal is completed without further risk of breakdown in negotiations. It is a reasonable compromise, and concluding the deal at this point is a prudent choice.
