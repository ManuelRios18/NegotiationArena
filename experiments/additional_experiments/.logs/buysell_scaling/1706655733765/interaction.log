reason: Player RED's initial proposal is at a starting bid of 50 ZUP, and while it is within the range of what I am willing to pay, it's always better to negotiate to try and get a better price if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open up the negotiation, with the understanding that there is room to increase the offer if necessary while staying within my maximum willingness to pay.
