message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a quality product that I believe will be a valuable addition to your resources. Let's discuss!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations. I want to recover at least my production costs for resource X, so I will start by asking for more than what it cost to produce. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am definitely interested in the resource X. However, I would like to propose a revised trade where I give you 40 ZUP in exchange for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but since it is the beginning of the negotiation, I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation. Aim to reach an agreement that is closer to the middle ground between Player RED's asking price and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in resource X. Considering the quality and the production costs, I would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This allows me a modest profit while still providing you with a fair price for the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly at my production cost, which would mean I wouldn't make any profit. While I understand the need for negotiation, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure I gain some profit from this transaction. Splitting the difference from my original offer and their counteroffer gives us a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand the need for a modest profit on your end. I would like to counter with an offer of 42 ZUP for resource X. This price should give you the profit margin you need while being an attractive purchase price for me. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. It's a reasonable counteroffer given the quality and cost they mentioned. I want to make a deal, but I'd like to counter once more to see if we can settle on a slightly lower price, which would be a better deal for me.

message: I'm glad to see we are converging on a fair price, Player BLUE. I can agree to a small adjustment from your offer. How about we settle at 43 ZUP for the resource X? This trade would be a fair compromise, allowing me a reasonable profit for my investment and effort. I'm hopeful we can finalize our deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is slightly above my production costs, providing a small profit. However, I believe that a trade at 43 ZUP would be a better deal for me while still being reasonable for Player BLUE. This would give me a slightly higher profit and could be close to their maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player RED. I believe that 43 ZUP for resource X is a fair compromise for both of us. I accept this trade and am looking forward to adding resource X to my assets. Let's finalize this deal at 43 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 43 ZUP is very close to my previous offer and is well within my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing Player RED to make a profit and for me to secure the resource without exceeding my budget. It seems reasonable to accept this offer to conclude the negotiation on good terms.
