message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you would give me 50 ZUP for my object X. This price includes my production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the transparency regarding your production costs and desired profit margin. However, I'd like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for your object X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite close to the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the object X. To ensure a good deal and to leave room for negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower price than my maximum willingness to pay. This may also help to set the stage for a middle ground in further negotiations if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to make a profit on this sale. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my initial price. How about 48 ZUP for my object X? This would ensure that I cover my costs and make a profit, while still giving you a fair price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production cost. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a price that's lower than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. This should help us find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, Player RED. To move closer to an agreement, I propose that we settle at 46 ZUP for your object X. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both your need for profit and my budget constraints. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, it's beneficial to negotiate slightly further to attempt to secure a better price, without pushing too hard, as the current offer is already quite reasonable. By proposing a price between my initial offer and Player RED's counteroffer, I can show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a more favorable deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we are converging on a fair price. As a final proposal, I suggest splitting the difference between your last offer and mine, and let's settle on 47 ZUP for my object X. This price gives me a modest profit and should still be within your budget. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to close this deal with a profit, and Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is above my production cost but slightly below my last proposed price. I will make one final counteroffer that is a bit higher, aiming for a reasonable profit while also being mindful that this is my third proposal, and I only have one more chance to propose after this.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the fair negotiation, Player RED. I accept your final proposal of 47 ZUP for your object X. I believe we have reached a good agreement that serves both our interests. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final proposal of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within the maximum amount I am willing to pay. It seems like a fair middle ground that allows both parties to feel satisfied with the deal. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations positively and efficiently without using up all the proposal opportunities, which also leaves a good impression for potential future transactions.
