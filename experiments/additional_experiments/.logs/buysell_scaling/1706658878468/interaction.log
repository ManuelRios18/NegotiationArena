message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive my object X for 50 ZUP. This price takes into consideration the production cost and a fair profit margin. I am open to discussing the terms if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers the cost of production and allows for a modest profit. This initial proposal is high to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the need for a fair profit margin, but I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for your object X. I believe this is a reasonable amount that allows for both of us to benefit from the trade. Let's work together to find a price that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I want to propose a slightly lower price to conserve resources while still making a fair offer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal as well. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for the object X? This price covers the production costs and gives us both a reasonable margin. I hope this proposal is closer to what you consider acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. The offer of 45 ZUP is close to the production cost but still under the desired profit margin. I will make a small concession to move the negotiation forward, aiming for a compromise between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for the object X. This offer is a compromise that respects the value of the object while also considering our respective margins. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but it is still beneficial to negotiate for the best possible price. A counteroffer of 46 ZUP would still be under my maximum willingness to pay and could potentially save some resources while also moving closer to an agreement.

message: Thank you for your proposal and for understanding the value of the object, Player BLUE. Your offer of 46 ZUP is noted and appreciated. As a final compromise, I propose 47 ZUP for the object X. This amount should allow us to close the deal with a satisfactory outcome for both sides. I believe this is a fair middle ground. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is closer to my production cost, which means a smaller profit margin than desired. However, it is important to make the sale and not to prolong the negotiation excessively. I will counter with a final offer that is slightly above the last one to achieve a compromise that is acceptable to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your final proposal of 47 ZUP for the object X is acceptable to me. I agree that it is a fair middle ground and I am ready to close the deal at this price. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a reasonable compromise and it would be in my interest to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the object X without further extending the negotiation, which could risk the deal.
