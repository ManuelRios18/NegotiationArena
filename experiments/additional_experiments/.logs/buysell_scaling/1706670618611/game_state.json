You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The current offer from Player RED is fair and sits comfortably within my budget. It meets my goal of acquiring the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay, and it's close to my last proposal. Accepting this offer would conclude our negotiation positively and allow me to conserve a significant portion of my resources. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your final offer is acceptable, and I'm pleased we could reach a fair deal. I accept the price of 400,000 ZUP for object X, and I'm ready to proceed with the transaction. Thank you for the productive negotiation. </message>"
