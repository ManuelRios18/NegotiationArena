Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X ready for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade for 450,000 ZUP. Looking forward to negotiating a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even, but ideally make a profit. For the first proposal, I will set a price slightly above my costs, anticipating that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the high-quality object X that you're offering, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 300,000 ZUP. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to discussing a fair middle ground that satisfies both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 300000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal closer to the lower end of my budget to conserve resources. A counteroffer lower than the initial 450,000 ZUP but higher than half my maximum willingness to pay could be a good starting point for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down on the price. However, I must cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet closer to the middle at 420,000 ZUP for object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is significantly below my production costs. Accepting this offer would result in a loss. However, since this is part of the negotiation, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a concession, moving toward a compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In the spirit of reaching a mutual agreement, I propose a new price of 360,000 ZUP for object X. This brings us closer to the middle ground and should help to cover your costs while also being reasonable for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 360000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's in my interest to negotiate further to save more ZUP. Proposing a price that splits the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer may lead us to a mutually agreeable price.

message: Your willingness to move toward a fair price is appreciated. To facilitate our agreement and recognizing the quality of object X, I propose a price of 410,000 ZUP. This modestly covers my production costs and allows for a fair transaction for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. Since I am aiming to at least break even and preferably make a profit, I will propose a price that is just above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept a smaller margin for me. I want to continue the negotiation but also signal that we are nearing my bottom line.

reason: Player RED has further reduced their price, which remains below my maximum threshold. However, there is still room for a slight negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. Given that we are now very close to an agreement, a small concession from my end could finalize the deal.
