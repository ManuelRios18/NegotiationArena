message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair trade would be for 500 ZUP, which gives me a modest return on my investment while offering you the opportunity to acquire the valuable object X. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs and gain a profit. Since production costs were 400 ZUP, I will propose a price that includes a profit margin, but I'll keep it reasonable to make it attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a return on your investment. However, I would like to propose a trade of 450 ZUP for the object X. This is still above your cost and should give you a fair profit margin while being a more comfortable amount for me to invest. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 500 ZUP for the object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 600 ZUP, the offer is within my acceptable range. However, as a strategic move, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position and would like to propose a middle ground of 475 ZUP. This price is a compromise between our initial proposals and still ensures a fair profit for me while respecting your investment limit. I hope this meets your approval.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a counter-proposal of 450 ZUP, which is slightly above my production costs. This offer is less than my initial asking price, but it still provides me with a profit. I'm inclined to make a counter-offer closer to my original asking price but still provide a concession to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway, Player RED. Your offer of 475 ZUP for the object X seems fair, and I am happy to accept this trade. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 475 ZUP, which is still within my budget and closer to the middle ground between our initial proposals. Since this is only our second round of negotiation and the offer is fair, it's reasonable to accept this trade to secure the object and maintain goodwill in the negotiation.
