message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of your product. In consideration of market conditions and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a trade of 40 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this offer is still fair and within a reasonable range. I am looking forward to your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, as in any negotiation, it may be beneficial to see if there is room for a better deal. Proposing a slightly lower price could lead to a more favorable trade while still keeping the offer within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering both our positions, I propose a revised trade of 42 ZUP for resource X. This would allow me to cover my costs and have a modest profit margin, ensuring the sustainability of my business. I hope this meets your approval for a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I will propose a price in the middle to come closer to a compromise while still ensuring a profit for my investment.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price for both of us. I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal that is still within my acceptable range. The proposed price is only slightly higher than my initial counteroffer and is below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair midpoint that respects both the seller's need for profitability and my own valuation of the resource. Accepting this offer would secure the resource without further negotiation and potential risk of losing the deal.
