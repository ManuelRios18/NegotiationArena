newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation, aiming to make a profit while still offering a fair deal to Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the production cost and the fact that we are just starting our negotiation, I would like to counter with 40 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the start of the negotiation and I have room to make counteroffers. I aim to propose a price closer to the middle ground between the cost price and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I'm looking to make a small profit for my efforts. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 42 ZUP for object X. I believe this to be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact production cost. While it's understandable that they want a fair price, I would like to make a slight profit. I will counter with a proposal that still gives me a small profit margin while remaining reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Your proposal of 42 ZUP for object X sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is reasonable and allows Player RED to make a profit while keeping the cost within my budget. Accepting this offer would leave me with enough resources for future transactions or needs.
