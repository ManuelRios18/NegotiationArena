message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this interests you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, I want to make a profit from my sale, so I will start by proposing a trade above my production cost, considering that the buyer might want to negotiate down. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a sale for 50 ZUP, leaving room for negotiation but also aiming for a reasonable profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am interested in object X, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for it. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my willing range to pay for the object X. However, as a strategic move, I will attempt to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources while still obtaining the object. My counteroffer will be lower than the asking price but still within a range that may be acceptable to Player RED, considering their cost of production.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While 45 ZUP is a fair offer, I would like to propose a compromise at 47 ZUP. This price still gives me a modest profit while also providing you with the object X at a reasonable price. Let's work together to make this deal happen!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which means I would still make a profit. However, it is below my initial asking price. I want to propose a compromise that might be acceptable to both parties, so I will suggest a slightly higher price than what Player BLUE offered, but still below my initial proposal. I will propose 47 ZUP, aiming to meet in the middle and secure the sale.

message: Player RED, your offer of 47 ZUP seems fair and I am willing to proceed with the purchase at that price. I look forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is still within my budget and quite close to my initial counteroffer. The difference of 2 ZUP from my counteroffer is minimal, and accepting it would ensure the acquisition of the object while maintaining good relations with Player RED, potentially benefiting future interactions. Since the offer is below my maximum willingness to pay and it seems that we are converging towards an agreement, I will accept this offer.
