message: I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit. I'll propose a price that's higher than my cost to see if the Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object X, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP, considering the market and the value it will bring to me. I believe this is still a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit margin on your end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a negotiating strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED considering their cost of 40 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I understand your position regarding the market value. To meet halfway, I propose a price of 48 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. This is a reasonable offer, but I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP for X, which is still within my budget. They have moved closer to my offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I believe accepting this offer would be beneficial as it is below my maximum willingness to pay, and further negotiations might not result in a significantly better deal.
