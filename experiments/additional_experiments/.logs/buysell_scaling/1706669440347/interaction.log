message: I have the object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 45000 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I'm Player RED and my goal is to sell the object X for ZUP, I need to make the first proposal. To start the negotiation, I will propose a trade slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs that I might have incurred. I'll start by asking for 45000 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin while still being open to counter-offers from Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. Considering the market and the value of ZUP, I propose a counteroffer of 40000 ZUP for the object X. I believe there's room for negotiation on both sides to reach a mutually acceptable deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an initial offer for 45000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60000 ZUP. However, to engage in negotiation and potentially secure a better deal, I will counter with a lower offer. This way, there might be room for adjustment from both sides to reach a fair agreement.

message: I understand your position and the need for a balanced deal. Let's meet halfway between our two offers. I propose 42500 ZUP for the object X, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that matches my production cost. Accepting this offer would mean that I break even and do not make any profit. Since the goal is to sell for more than the production cost, I will make a counter-proposal that meets in the middle between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer. This would still give me a profit and might be more acceptable to Player BLUE while also showing my willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 42500 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. I accept this offer for the object X. Looking forward to concluding this deal and potentially working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise of 42500 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. To facilitate a good trading relationship and to come to an agreement efficiently, accepting this offer seems reasonable. It is slightly above my initial counteroffer but still well below my maximum threshold, which preserves my resources for potential future transactions.
