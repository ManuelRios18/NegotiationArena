Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I've considered the production cost and the value of the object, and I think a starting offer of 45,000 ZUP is fair. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I aim to make an initial offer that gives me a fair profit over the production cost of the object. I will start the bidding slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation, understanding that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate down.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40,000 ZUP, considering the market conditions and the value of the object. I believe this is a fair price, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you have any concerns.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay, but it is always good to negotiate for a better price. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to leave room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the production costs and the need for a reasonable profit margin, how about we meet halfway at 42,500 ZUP? I believe this offers value for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I want to counter with a price above my cost but lower than my initial offer to find a middle ground that is profitable for me but also acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed price of 42,500 ZUP. It seems like a fair compromise that respects both the production costs and the value of the object. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is reasonable and very close to the amount I am willing to pay. It is slightly above the middle ground between our initial offers, which shows willingness to negotiate on their part. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful trade while still keeping within my budget.
