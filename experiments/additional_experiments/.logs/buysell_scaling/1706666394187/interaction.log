message: I'm offering an object of value produced at a cost of 40000 ZUP. Considering its value and the effort put into its production, I believe a price of 50000 ZUP would be a fair trade. Would you be interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and the effort put into the production of the object. To make it a win-win situation, I propose a price of 48000 ZUP. This is above your cost, ensuring you a profit, and it's also a better deal for me. Would this counter-offer work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offered price by Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate a better deal if possible, especially since their cost of production is 40000 ZUP. Proposing a slightly lower price may be advantageous, but it should still be a fair offer to keep the negotiation friendly and open.

message: I'm glad to see we're close to reaching an agreement. Your offer of 48000 ZUP is appreciated, and I understand the need for a win-win situation. To finalize our deal and recognizing your fair negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial proposal. Would you consider 49000 ZUP as a fair price to conclude this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 48000 ZUP, which is above my production cost and ensures a profit. However, I initially asked for 50000 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. Since Player BLUE's offer is relatively close to my asking price and still allows for a significant profit, I am inclined to make a slight adjustment to meet in the middle, further incentivizing the completion of the trade for both parties.

message: I believe 49000 ZUP is a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept this price. Let's conclude our trade at this value. Thank you for your flexibility and for engaging in a fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-proposal by only asking for an additional 1000 ZUP. This price is still below my maximum willingness to pay and allows for a quick and amicable agreement. It's beneficial to close the deal at this point to avoid risking the negotiation and to secure the resources for my needs.
