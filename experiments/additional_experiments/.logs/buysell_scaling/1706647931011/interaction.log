message: I'm offering one unit of X for 50 ZUP. This would give me a reasonable profit margin and should be a good deal for you as well. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit while still being within what I presume could be an acceptable range for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I was looking to purchase the resources at a slightly lower price. Could you consider my counteroffer of 45 ZUP for one unit of X? This price would fit better into my budget while still providing you with a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as part of negotiation strategy, I will try to get a better deal by countering with a lower offer. This leaves room for further negotiation and potentially better terms.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To meet in the middle, I propose selling my one unit of X for 47 ZUP. This price allows us both to handle our budgets while making sure we both come out with a satisfactory deal. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that still provides me with a profit, although it is less than initially proposed. I believe we can find a middle ground that is acceptable for both parties. Meeting halfway between my initial proposal and their counteroffer could potentially satisfy both of our goals.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal to meet in the middle is fair and I'm happy to accept the offer of 47 ZUP for one unit of X. Thank you for the negotiation, looking forward to completing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is slightly above my initial counteroffer but still well within my maximum willingness to pay. It would be practical to accept this offer as it meets my goals and saves time on further negotiation. Accepting now will secure the resources at a price I am comfortable with.
