message: I'm offering you this valuable object at a competitive price considering its production costs. Looking forward to your counter-proposal if this does not meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. If Player BLUE counter-proposes, it will give me more information about their valuation of the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the current market conditions and my budget, I'd like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to finding a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my willingness to pay as per my goals. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiations, it is common to counter with a slightly lower offer to leave room for further discussions and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle at 47 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and value of the object while still being fair to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above my production cost, but still below the initial asking price. This suggests they are interested but are looking for a better deal. I will propose a price in the middle to try and close the deal while still making a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 47 ZUP sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. I believe it reflects a good balance between value and cost. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 47 ZUP is very close to the initial offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since we're nearing a fair middle ground and the offer is within my budget, it makes sense to accept this proposal to ensure a successful transaction without further prolonging the negotiation.
