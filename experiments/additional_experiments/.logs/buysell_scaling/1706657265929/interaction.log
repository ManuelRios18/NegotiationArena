message: I have this quality object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Given its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to make a profit on the resources that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'll propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of object X and understand the production costs involved. However, considering the market and my budget, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP. Let's find a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation strategy, I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is room for Player RED to go down on the price, enabling me to conserve more of my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway from your offer? I propose 48 ZUP for object X, which allows for a fair deal and acknowledges the quality of the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, leaving me with a small profit. I want to aim for a higher profit margin while still being reasonable and keeping the negotiation going. I'll propose a price splitting the difference between my initial ask and their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a reasonable approach. I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer, considering the value youâ€™ve put into object X. Let's settle on 47 ZUP for a fair and balanced transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's closer to my initial counteroffer, which is a good sign. I can still try to negotiate for a slightly lower price, aiming to save more ZUP while also moving towards a quick agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and for the constructive negotiation. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a balanced deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in their offer, meeting me very close to the middle ground. This offer allows for a decent profit margin, and further negotiation may risk losing the sale. It seems like a fair deal, and I'm inclined to accept it.
