message: Hi Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a small profit. Let's start the bidding at 45 ZUP. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least my production cost of 40 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I'm interested in the resource X. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 42 ZUP to account for the market fluctuations and to ensure a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the starting bid. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about market fluctuations. To meet halfway, how about we settle on 43 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit while ensuring you get the resource at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, but I'm aiming for a profit. I'll propose a compromise that still gives me a slight profit while showing willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise, Player RED. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the resource X. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is just 1 ZUP more than my previous proposal and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground, and accepting this offer would result in a successful transaction without exhausting the negotiation process.
