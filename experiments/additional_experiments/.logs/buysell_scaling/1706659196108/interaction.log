message: I'm offering resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value of X, I propose a fair starting trade of 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP and it cost 40 ZUP to produce, the initial proposal should cover the production costs and ideally include a profit margin. However, since this is the first proposal and negotiations might be necessary, the starting price might be higher than the expected selling price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the quality of X. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource, considering that we both should benefit from this deal. It's still above your cost, ensuring you make a profit, while also keeping it within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer is within my maximum budget, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve ZUP for potential future transactions. I want to propose a lower amount that is still above Player RED's cost of production to ensure the deal is also appealing to them.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet in the middle and ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose 48 ZUP for resource X. This is a little above your offer, ensuring a profit for me and a fair deal for you considering the value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 45 ZUP, which is above the production cost and allows for a profit. However, it's below the initial asking price. A compromise might be to meet halfway between the initial asking price and the counteroffer. Proposing a slightly higher amount could still result in a profitable and satisfactory deal for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. To further meet halfway, I propose 46 ZUP for resource X. This should ensure a fair deal for both of us, keeping in mind the value of X and our mutual interests in this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial counteroffer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new proposal of 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but I believe there is room for a slight adjustment that could benefit me while still providing RED with a profit. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal but still gives room for RED to profit.

message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for resource X. It's a pleasure doing business with you, and I believe this is a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has raised their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a fair price and allows for a reasonable profit margin. Given that this is the third proposal and we are converging towards an agreeable price, accepting this offer would ensure a profitable sale without further negotiations, which could risk the deal falling through.
