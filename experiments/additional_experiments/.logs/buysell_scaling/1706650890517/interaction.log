Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object of high quality that required significant resources to create. I propose trading it for 50 ZUP to cover the production costs and to ensure a fair profit margin for its value. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start with a proposal that allows me to recover the production cost plus a small profit margin. This is an opening offer, expecting that Player BLUE will want to negotiate the price. It is important to start with a proposal rather than accepting any upcoming offer from Player BLUE because I want to guide the negotiation towards a favorable outcome for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the high quality of the object and the effort put into its creation. However, as a starting point for our negotiation, I propose 45 ZUP. This allows us to work towards a trade that is beneficial for both parties while ensuring I stay within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I want to negotiate a better deal for myself while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I can assess Player RED's flexibility and possibly arrive at a more favorable trade for me.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the importance of staying within budget. Let's meet halfway and make it 47 ZUP. This will cover my production costs and provide a fair profit while also respecting your budget constraints. I believe this is a mutually beneficial compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is close to my production cost. Since I want to make a profit, I cannot accept the 45 ZUP offer. I will make a counterproposal that splits the difference between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer, aiming for a compromise that still allows me a satisfactory profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the consideration and the willingness to meet halfway. To move closer to a deal that satisfies both of us, I propose 46 ZUP. This price should help cover your costs while also being fair to my budget. I believe we're close to an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by coming down to 47 ZUP. This is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but as there is still room to negotiate, I would like to try for a slightly better price that is closer to my initial counteroffer while still showing my willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to the proposed price of 46 ZUP. I think this is a fair trade for both of us, taking into account the value of the object and the needs of both parties. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new proposal that is just 1 ZUP below my last counteroffer. This shows willingness to close the deal and respect for my production costs. Accepting this offer will give me a profit of 6 ZUP, which is reasonable. It's important to close the deal while the negotiation is positive and both parties feel the trade is fair. Further negotiation might result in diminishing returns or a breakdown in talks.
