message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 4500 ZUP, which would cover my costs and provide a fair return for the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that seeks to cover my costs and possibly make a profit. Given that the production cost of the resource was 4000 ZUP, I will suggest a price slightly above that to start the negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your need to cover production costs. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP, which is still above your production cost and ensures you a profit. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget of 6000 ZUP, but as a buyer, I would like to negotiate a better deal if possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is open to negotiation, aiming to conserve some of my ZUP while still making an offer that is above their stated production cost.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair compromise, so how about we meet halfway? I propose selling the object X for 4350 ZUP. This price would give me a modest profit while also respecting the value you've placed on the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I would like to propose a price that meets halfway between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer. This should provide a reasonable profit while also taking into account Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to meet you halfway at 4350 ZUP. This seems like a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to finalize this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 4350 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to their initial asking price. The proposed price of 4350 ZUP is still within my budget, and meeting halfway shows goodwill in the negotiation process. Although it's slightly above my initial counteroffer, I believe accepting this offer would be a good decision as it secures the resource I need without exhausting my budget and allows for a quick resolution to the trade.
