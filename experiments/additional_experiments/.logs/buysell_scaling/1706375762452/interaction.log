message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to start this negotiation at 50 ZUP for my resource, considering its value and production costs. Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to begin the negotiation by proposing a slightly higher asking price than what it cost me to produce, which allows room for negotiation and a potential profit.

message: I appreciate your offer and the production costs you've incurred. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for your resource. This leaves us both with room to adjust as we move forward in our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for the resource. This price reflects the quality and the production cost, while also providing you with a fair deal. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. I want to counter-propose with a price that is closer to my initial ask of 50 ZUP, yet showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly.

message: Thanks for considering my previous offer. I think we are getting closer to an agreement. How about we settle at 46 ZUP? This price is fair and acknowledges the value of your resource while staying within a comfortable range for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my acceptable range. It's closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still a reasonable offer. To continue negotiations and try to secure a slightly better deal, I will make a counteroffer that's a bit less than their proposal but more than my initial offer.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is at 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP higher than my last offer and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. Since we are very close to a deal and the difference is minimal, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the transaction is completed amicably and efficiently.
