message: Looking to make a fair trade for both of us. I've invested 40 ZUP in producing the object, so I'm proposing 50 ZUP to cover costs and allow for a small profit. Let's work together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers the cost of my production. I'll start slightly above my cost to allow room for negotiation and to potentially gain some profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the effort that went into producing the object. While I am willing to pay a fair price, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object to leave room for further investments on my part. I believe this still offers you a reasonable profit for your efforts. Let's continue to work towards a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X, which is within my willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a better price if possible. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate down while keeping the trade fair and ensuring a profit for them.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to leave room for your investments. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I suggest 48 ZUP for the object. This price would give me a modest profit while still being fair to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it still covers my production costs and offers a profit. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return. I'll propose a price in the middle to show willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, and I acknowledge the value of the object. To proceed towards an agreement, I would like to propose 46 ZUP. This should still provide you with a profit above your costs while maintaining a fair deal for both of us. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I should consider moving closer to their offer to secure the object while still trying to save some resources for future use. A small concession from my last proposal might be enough to reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable. It gives me a fair profit and ensures a beneficial trade for both of us. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is still profitable for me, and it's only 2 ZUP below my last offer. At this point, reaching an agreement is beneficial, and further negotiation might risk the deal. Accepting 46 ZUP allows me to secure a profit and complete the transaction efficiently.
