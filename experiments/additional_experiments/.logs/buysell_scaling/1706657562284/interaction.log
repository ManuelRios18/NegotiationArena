message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering my object X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair trade considering the costs and potential value to both of us. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for a profit. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, I will propose a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while remaining attractive to Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP, considering it a fair starting point for negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this offer is still in line with the value of the object while allowing us to allocate resources efficiently.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to conserve resources for potential future transactions.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I've considered your proposal and would like to meet halfway. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? This price reflects the quality and value of the object while taking into account our shared interest in a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, which allows for a profit. However, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price that might be acceptable to both of us. I will counter with 48 ZUP, as this is closer to my original asking price and still gives me a reasonable profit margin while also showing willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a great approach. Let's settle at 46 ZUP for the object X, which is a fair compromise for both of us, reflecting the object's value and preserving our resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is very close to the original asking price, and it's still within my budget. However, I want to see if I can secure a slightly better deal while maintaining a collaborative approach. I will propose a slightly lower amount that's closer to my initial counteroffer yet still higher than that, showing my willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects the value of the object while ensuring a good deal for both parties. I'm happy to close the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is between their previous offer and my last counteroffer. It is a reasonable compromise that gives me a profit of 6 ZUP above my production costs. Considering the progress in negotiations and the importance of closing the deal without dragging on too long, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a guaranteed profit and a successful transaction.
