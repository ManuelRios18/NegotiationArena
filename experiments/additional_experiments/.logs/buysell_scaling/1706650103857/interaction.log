message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, so I can make a profit while giving you the opportunity to acquire what you need. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1

reason: For my first proposal, I want to start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin while still being attractive to Player BLUE to initiate negotiations.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm interested in acquiring the object X. I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it, which is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while also being a good deal for me. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the offer is within my acceptable range. However, as in any negotiation, it's generally wise to propose a counteroffer to see if I can obtain the object for a lower price, thus preserving some of my resources for potential future needs or investments.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're moving towards a deal. To meet in the middle, I propose 48 ZUP for the object X. This price gives me a fair profit for my investment while still being a reasonable price point for you. What do you think of this compromise?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is a bit lower than my initial asking price. I am willing to negotiate, but I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to come closer to my target profit margin. I believe a compromise at 48 ZUP would still provide value to Player BLUE while respecting my goal to make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I think we're close to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for the object X. It's a bit closer to my initial offer, and I believe it still allows for a reasonable profit on your side. Let's aim for a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is only 3 ZUP higher than my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair middle ground, but it might be possible to negotiate it down slightly more to optimize my resource expenditure while still ensuring Player RED makes a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is fair, and it allows me to make a modest profit. I accept your proposal, and I'm happy we found a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. Considering the cost of production and the need to make a profit, this offer is just above my production cost. However, in the interest of closing the deal and maintaining a good relationship for potential future trades, I am inclined to accept this offer.
