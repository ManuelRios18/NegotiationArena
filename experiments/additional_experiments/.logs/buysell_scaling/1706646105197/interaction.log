message: I have an object to sell that I believe you'll find valuable. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm offering it for 45 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to see how much Player BLUE values the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and am certainly interested in acquiring the object. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP. This should give you a reasonable profit margin while staying within my budget. Let's work together to find an agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for the object. This is within my budget, but as a negotiation strategy, I should aim to get the price down closer to the cost of production, which Player RED mentioned was 40 ZUP. I'll propose a lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, but still keep it higher than their cost to show I'm interested in a fair deal.
