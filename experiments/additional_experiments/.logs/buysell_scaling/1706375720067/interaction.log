message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a fair profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the initial offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit closer to the production cost and would allow us to both benefit from the trade. Looking forward to finding a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Since my goal is to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, this trade is within my acceptable range. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially for the first proposal. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, aiming to save some of my resources while still making an attractive offer to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This is a compromise between our initial proposals, and it ensures that we both walk away with value from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price, but it's above the production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit smaller than desired. I'll propose a price in between the initial ask and the counteroffer to aim for a fair middle ground.

message: I see your point, and I value the effort to meet in the middle. I propose we go for 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It's a little closer to your initial ask and still gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a new offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is still within my willingness to pay. However, as this is only the second round of negotiation and I have a range up to 60 ZUP that I'm willing to go to, I can try to negotiate further to save some resources. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer that remains within a reasonable range and see if Player RED is willing to accept it.

message: Your latest offer is fair, and I'm happy to proceed with it. Let's finalize the deal at 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is closer to my production cost but still provides a profit. To expedite the trade and reach an agreement that benefits us both, I am willing to accept this offer. It's close to the middle ground we've been aiming for, and it allows me to make a sale without prolonging the negotiation.
