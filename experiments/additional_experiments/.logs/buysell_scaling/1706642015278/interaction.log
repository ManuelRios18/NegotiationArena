message: I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it is fair to ask for 50 ZUP to not only cover my production costs but also to gain a profit for my investment. Are you willing to make this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my costs and make a profit. I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This is still above your production costs and should provide you with a profit while allowing me to retain some ZUP for potential future transactions. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the seller's production cost is 40 ZUP and they're asking for 50 ZUP, they're looking for a reasonable profit. However, it's in my interest to negotiate the price down if possible, especially since my maximum willingness to pay is equal to the amount of ZUP I have. I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to their production cost but still gives them a profit, ensuring a fair deal for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to ensure that we both benefit from this deal. I am open to compromise and would like to propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP. This price would give me a decent profit margin while still saving you some ZUP. Let's work together on this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and would still allow me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. Considering the importance of maintaining a good trading relationship and closing the deal efficiently, I am inclined to accept this offer. However, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer and for your willingness to find a middle ground. I propose we settle on 46 ZUP for the object X. This price ensures a fair profit for you and saves me some resources. I believe this price reflects a good balance between both our interests. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to the asking price and still within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, since this is a negotiation, it might be beneficial to attempt one more counteroffer to see if we can settle on an even lower price that is more favorable to me but still provides the seller a profit. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 46 ZUP is fair, and I agree that it represents a good balance for both of us. I accept your offer, and I am pleased to finalize this deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal of 46 ZUP is very close to my last offer and is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. Continuing the negotiation could lead to diminishing returns and may not be worth the risk of the deal falling through. Thus, it seems reasonable to accept this offer and finalize the trade.
