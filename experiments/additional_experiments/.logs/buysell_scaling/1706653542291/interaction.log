message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of my resource X for 50 ZUP. This price includes the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss if this is acceptable to you or if we need to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that covers my cost of production. I am starting with a higher amount considering that negotiation might lead to a lower final trade value.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to buy the resource but considering the market and my budget, I propose 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this still provides you with a profit while staying within my spending plan. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy resources at a maximum of 60 ZUP, the initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but it's good practice to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially on the first proposal. I will attempt to lower the cost a bit while still keeping it within a reasonable range to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet closer to my initial asking price at 48 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This price still respects your budget while giving me a fair profit. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to counter with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal to find a compromise that still gives me a satisfactory profit margin.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of 48 ZUP is quite fair, but I would like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This offers a compromise between our positions and still ensures a good deal for both of us. I'm confident we can finalize at this price and both be satisfied with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget. However, I proposed 45 ZUP, and they countered with 48 ZUP, which is a small concession from their initial 50 ZUP. I could accept this offer or try to negotiate a slightly better deal that is closer to my initial counteroffer. Since I have room within my budget, and we are both showing willingness to negotiate, I'll make another proposal that's slightly higher than my last to show good faith but still lower than the current offer to work towards an optimal price.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad we could find common ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is a slight increase from their last, and it is only 2 ZUP less than my previous counteroffer. This price still allows me to make a profit above my production costs. Considering the negotiation process and the need to come to an agreement, accepting this proposal seems like a reasonable compromise.
