message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP in return, allowing me to make a fair profit and ensuring you receive a high-quality product. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the game with an opening proposal that aims to recoup the production costs of my resource while also seeking a profit. I'm starting with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the object X. This would still give you a profit above your production cost, while being more in line with my budget. I hope this can be the beginning of a mutually beneficial negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as in any negotiation, there's an opportunity to propose a lower price to conserve resources and potentially gain a better deal. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which gives Player RED a chance to still make a profit while giving me some room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that we're converging towards an agreement. To meet halfway, I propose a trade of 48 ZUP for the object X. This still gives me a reasonable profit while coming closer to your budget. I hope this adjusted proposal is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE and their willingness to negotiate. The proposed 45 ZUP is above my production cost, but I believe there is still room to negotiate for a higher amount closer to my initial asking price. I'll propose a slightly lower price than my original offer, but still higher than what Player BLUE has offered.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I believe we are indeed getting closer to a fair trade for both parties. My new proposal is 46 ZUP for the object X. This offer still respects your need for profit and also takes into account my budget constraints. I hope you find this proposal to be a reasonable step towards finalizing our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is getting closer to my initial counteroffer. It's above what I initially offered but still within my willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and aim for a better price while also showing willingness to compromise, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below Player RED's current ask. My next offer will be 46 ZUP, which is a small increment from my initial proposal and might be acceptable to Player RED while saving me resources.

message: Thank you for your new proposal, Player BLUE. It's great to see us working towards a common ground. As a sign of good faith and in the interest of reaching an agreement, I propose a final trade of 47 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair compromise that grants me a modest profit and respects your budget. I hope this meets your approval and we can conclude our negotiation on positive terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is closer to my production cost, but it is a reasonable increment from their previous offer. I want to make a profit while also closing the deal. I will make one final proposal that splits the difference between our last two offers, which should be an appealing compromise for both of us.
