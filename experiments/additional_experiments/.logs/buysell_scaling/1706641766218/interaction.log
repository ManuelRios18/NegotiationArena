message: I would like to offer you my resource X for 50 ZUP. This is a quality product that cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe it's worth the price considering its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit, so I'll start by requesting a higher amount of ZUP than the cost of production. This is my first proposal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the quality of the product, but I'm looking to make a deal that allows room for my future investments as well. Would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for your resource X? This still offers you a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell their resource for 50 ZUP, which is within the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. However, it is beneficial for me to negotiate a lower price if possible to conserve my resources for any future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range above their cost of production.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the importance of leaving room for future investments. I propose a slight adjustment to 48 ZUP, ensuring a fair transaction for both of us. This price reflects the quality of the resource while still giving you a good deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my asking price and gives me a profit, but I want to try to get a slightly better deal. I'll propose a compromise just above their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway from our last two offers, I propose a compromise at 46 ZUP. This should cover your costs comfortably and provide a reasonable profit margin, while still maintaining my position for future transactions. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to their original asking price. This price is still acceptable, as it is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of the negotiation process, I will attempt to settle on a price that is in the middle of our last two proposals. I want to reach a fair agreement that reflects both the value of the resource and my interest in conserving ZUP for other potential uses.

message: Your proposal of 46 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. It provides me with a profit and allows you to secure the resource for your future investments. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The compromise offer from Player BLUE is less than my previous proposal, but it still yields a profit that is acceptable. Considering this is a negotiation, I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful sale and maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings.
