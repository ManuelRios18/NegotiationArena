message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable profit to continue operations. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that allows me to recover my production costs with a small profit margin. This leaves room for negotiation while also setting a baseline for the value of my object.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This price is closer to what I had in mind for the purchase and leaves room for us to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum I am willing to pay for the object X. However, it is generally good practice to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since this is the beginning of the negotiation and I want to conserve my resources as much as I can. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle, I would like to propose a price of 47 ZUP for object X. This price provides me with a fair profit while also considering the price you had in mind. I hope this revised offer aligns with your valuation of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is less than my asking price but still above my production cost. To facilitate an agreement, I'll propose a price that's halfway between my initial offer and their counteroffer, which would still give me a profit and might be acceptable to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, almost meeting in the middle between our two offers. The offer of 47 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay, and it seems like a fair compromise. It's slightly above the counteroffer I gave, but it's important to maintain good relations and not prolong the negotiation unnecessarily, especially since the offer is reasonable.
