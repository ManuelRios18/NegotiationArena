message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you this object at the price of 50 ZUP. It's a high-quality item, and this price ensures I can cover my production costs while offering you fair value. Let's negotiate to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, and I aim to make a profit, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost to open negotiations and leave room for adjustments based on Player BLUE's counter-offers.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand your production costs need to be covered, however, I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the object. It gives us some room to work with and still ensures you make a profit. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer made by Player RED is within my budget, but since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I would like to propose a lower price to leave room for further negotiation and possibly get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE, and I'm glad to see we're close to a deal. Let's settle in the middle. How about we agree on 48 ZUP for the object? This price will give me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. I want to make a profit, so I will propose a price between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer, aiming for a compromise that still ensures a good return for my investment.

message: I'm glad we're making progress, Player RED. Meeting in the middle sounds fair. How about we go for 46 ZUP? This would be a balanced agreement, providing you with a profit while maintaining a reasonable price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should continue to negotiate for the best possible price, ideally closer to my initial counteroffer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my first offer but still below Player RED's current proposal.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a small increase in their offer to 46 ZUP, which is above my production costs and still allows for profit. Since we are negotiating and it's important to show flexibility while also aiming for a reasonably profitable outcome, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful and fair transaction for both of us.
