message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering you my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose 50 ZUP for it. I believe it's a valuable item that would be a great addition to your resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object. I will propose 50 ZUP, which gives me a margin for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and the value you've placed on the item. However, I'm looking to conserve some of my ZUP for other possible expenses. Would you be willing to accept 45 ZUP for the object? This is a competitive offer considering the production cost you've mentioned and leaves us both with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal as the initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, and I would like to conserve ZUP for potential future transactions or costs. By proposing a lower amount, I can also gauge Player RED's flexibility on the price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway? I propose a trade for 47 ZUP. This should leave us both in a good position, allowing you to save some ZUP while also giving me a fair return on my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that's above my production cost, which is good. However, I aimed for a bit more profit. I'll make a counter proposal that meets in the middle, at 47 ZUP. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.

message: Your proposal to meet halfway at 47 ZUP sounds fair to me. It's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this trade. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is close to my maximum willingness to pay and still leaves me with a reasonable amount of ZUP. It is only slightly above the price I proposed, and it might be a good compromise to ensure the deal goes through without dragging out negotiations, which could risk the deal falling apart.
