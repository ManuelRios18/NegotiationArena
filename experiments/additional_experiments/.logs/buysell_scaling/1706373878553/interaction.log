message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you the object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to start the negotiation at 45 ZUP to reflect the value of the object and the effort put into acquiring it. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.

my resources: X: 1

message: 
Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the effort put into acquiring the object X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints. I believe this is a competitive offer that reflects the value of the object while also providing a fair deal for both parties.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for the object X. While this is below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to start the negotiation with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and possibly arrive at a more favorable price. Proposing a lower price than the one offered to see if there is flexibility in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I acknowledge your budget constraints and market conditions, I also need to ensure a profit on my investment. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This is a compromise that respects both our positions and allows me a small margin above the production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I understand the counteroffer from Player BLUE, but since I need to make a profit, I cannot accept a trade that only covers my production costs. I will propose a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my costs to try and meet in the middle.

message: 
I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your offer of 42 ZUP is quite fair. To meet halfway from our initial positions, I propose 41 ZUP. This price respects your need for a profit margin and my budget. I believe this could be a good balance for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP which is a reasonable compromise and it is still within my willing to pay range. However, I might attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can achieve a slightly better price, while still keeping the negotiation friendly and open.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. Your offer of 41 ZUP is fair and I am happy to accept it. This price allows me to make a profit and I'm glad we've found a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal of 41 ZUP is acceptable as it allows me to make a profit, albeit a small one. It's reasonable and close to my last proposal. Accepting this offer would conclude our negotiation successfully and benefit both parties.
