message: I have a high-quality object X for sale that cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I propose a trade where you give me 4500 ZUP for this object. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my production costs and leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose a higher amount initially to see what the Player BLUE is willing to offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking to cover your costs and make a profit. I'm interested in the object but would like to propose a starting trade of 4000 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair offer considering market conditions and leaves us both room to discuss further if necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED is for 4500 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range of expenditure for the object X. However, as a strategic buyer, I should initially propose a trade that's lower than my maximum willingness to pay to allow room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you're looking for a fair deal. Considering the quality and the production cost of the object, I would like to propose a small profit margin for myself. How about we settle on 4200 ZUP for the object X? This is a modest increase that allows me to sustain my business while still providing you with a valuable item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production. While this covers my costs, it does not provide me with any profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount that still gives me a profit, albeit a smaller one than initially proposed, in order to move the negotiation forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I propose we meet halfway between our last two proposals. How about we finalize this deal at 4100 ZUP for the object X? This price respects the quality of your item and your need for profit, while also reflecting my goal to make a prudent purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4100
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 4200 ZUP is still well within my budget and aligns with my goal to obtain the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would result in a quick agreement beneficial to both parties. However, there might be an opportunity to meet halfway between our two proposals, achieving an even more advantageous trade for me.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 4100 ZUP for object X is a fair compromise. It respects the value of the object and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm happy to finalize this deal at your proposed price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that splits the difference between our proposals. Accepting this offer would allow me to make a modest profit of 100 ZUP. It's a fair compromise that ensures both parties walk away satisfied. Since this is the third proposal and we're close to a deal, it makes sense to accept it.
