message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. It's great that we are converging on a price that works for both of us. In the spirit of compromise, I would like to propose 46 ZUP for object X. This price accounts for my budget while still providing you with a fair return on your product. Looking forward to your response.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. It is still under my maximum willingness to pay. Since we are nearing a reasonable price range and this is only the second proposal, I will counter with a slightly increased offer to show goodwill and continue the negotiation, aiming for a final agreement that is beneficial for both parties.

message: I appreciate your latest offer and your willingness to find common ground, Player BLUE. As a final proposal, I can agree to a price of 47 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a modest profit while still being fair to your budget. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. I hope we can finalize our deal at this price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now above the production cost. However, it is still below the target profit margin. Since this is the third proposal, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price but still within a range that should be acceptable to Player BLUE, considering their willingness to negotiate.
