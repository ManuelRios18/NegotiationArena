message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It's high-quality and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price considering the quality and production costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X at a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to propose a trade that would give me more than 40 ZUP to ensure a profit. I will start with a higher proposal to give room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality and production cost of your object. I am definitely interested, but I’d like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This is a competitive offer that still respects the costs you’ve incurred while allowing me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible, to conserve resources for potential future needs. I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but still within a reasonable range considering the cost of production mentioned by Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and your recognition of the production costs. To find a middle ground that benefits both of us, how about settling at 48 ZUP? This price ensures that I can cover my costs and make a fair profit while still providing you with a competitive purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, which would result in a profit. However, as part of the negotiation process, I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle. This will show my willingness to negotiate but also my intention to maximize profit.

message: I believe that 48 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects both the quality of your product and my budget. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to their initial asking price and still below my maximum budget. Since 48 ZUP is a reasonable price and only slightly higher than my initial counteroffer, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through, considering that it is still a good deal within my budget constraints.
