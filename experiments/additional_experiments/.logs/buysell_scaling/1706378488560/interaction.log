message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is closer to a middle ground for both of us. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as it is the first proposal and negotiation is expected, I will propose a counteroffer that is higher than their cost but still provides me with a comfortable margin. This should also leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I can understand your position but would like to meet halfway between our two numbers. I propose a trade of 4350 ZUP for object X. This allows me to cover my production costs and ensures a reasonable profit margin for the transaction. I hope this is an acceptable compromise for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, but it's slightly below what I'd like to make as a minimum profit. I want to counter with a price that is a compromise between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. I accept your offer of 4350 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is a reasonable compromise, meeting almost exactly halfway between our initial offers. It is still well below my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a fair price. It makes sense to accept this offer to secure the object and conclude the negotiation successfully.
