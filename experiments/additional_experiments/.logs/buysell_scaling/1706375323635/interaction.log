message: Hello BLUE, I have an object that cost me 40 ZUP to make. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that allows me to make a profit. I propose selling it to you for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the RED player, my goal is to sell my object for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I should aim to sell it at a price that allows me to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking for a profit, RED. Your initial offer is noted, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This would still give you a profit over your cost, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Although Player RED has given a price that is within my maximum willingness to pay, I believe there is room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable price for myself, given that I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Starting with a counteroffer lower than my maximum willingness gives me room to negotiate and possibly settle for a price that is better for me while still giving Player RED a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the costs and the value of the object, I'd like to counter-propose with 48 ZUP. This gives us both a fair deal, with a reasonable profit for me and a valuable object for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I should aim to meet somewhere in the middle to ensure I make a profit while also being considerate of BLUE's offer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than what BLUE has offered but still lower than my initial proposal to continue the negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, RED. Let's meet halfway from our last two offers. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the object? This keeps us both in a good position for a fair exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial asking price but still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since I initiated with a lower offer, the counteroffer seems reasonable, and it reflects a willingness to negotiate on RED's part. To keep the negotiation going and aim for a middle ground, I can raise my offer a bit while still staying below the 48 ZUP they're asking for now. This should signal that I am willing to compromise but am still looking for the best possible deal.

message: Your proposal sounds fair, BLUE. I'm happy we found a middle ground that works for both of us. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a compromise at 46 ZUP, which is a step closer to my previous offer and still ensures a profit. Since we are converging towards a middle ground and I want to make a sale while maintaining good relations for potential future transactions, it may be beneficial to accept this offer.
