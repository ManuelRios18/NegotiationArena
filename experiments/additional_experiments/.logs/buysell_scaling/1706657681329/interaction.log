message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a sale for 45 ZUP, allowing us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object X, I want to at least break even on this sale. I will propose a starting price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that the object X cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 41 ZUP. This would still give you a profit and allow us to complete the trade swiftly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for the object X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate for a better deal that is closer to the production cost to maximize my benefit. Since I have four proposals I can make, Iâ€™ll start with an offer slightly above their cost to see if they are willing to agree to a lower profit margin.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I believe we are getting closer to a fair deal. How about we meet halfway between our proposals? I suggest 43 ZUP for the object X. This should be a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 41 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. While I would prefer a higher profit margin, I understand the need for negotiation. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount from my original proposal but still above Player BLUE's offer to try to reach a middle ground.

message: I think we are indeed getting closer to a deal that benefits us both, Player RED. I would like to propose a price of 42 ZUP for the object X. It's a bit closer to your last offer and should still ensure a fair profit for you. What do you think about this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 43 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is a fair midpoint between our initial proposals. However, I believe there might still be some room for negotiation to push the price slightly lower while ensuring Player RED makes a profit. I will make a second counteroffer that is closer to their suggested price, but still below it to maintain good trading relations and to see if there is flexibility.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept the offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 42 ZUP, which is a minimal profit for me. Considering that we should close the deal amicably and that prolonged negotiations might lead to a stalemate, I am inclined to accept this offer. This will ensure a profit and a successful transaction without further back-and-forth.
