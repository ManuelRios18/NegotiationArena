message: Dear Player BLUE, Iâ€™d like to offer you the object X for 4500 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a fair profit margin. I believe this is a valuable offer for a high-quality resource. Let's negotiate if you have a different value in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start with a trade offer that allows me to recover my production costs and possibly make a profit. I will set a starting price that is higher than my costs to give room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the market and the value of the resource, I'd like to counterpropose with 4000 ZUP for the object X. I think this is a reasonable offer that takes into account the quality of the resource while also being economical for my budget. Let's work together to finalize a deal that works for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower purchase price to conserve ZUP for potential future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground between the asking price and my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for an economical purchase, but I also need to consider the costs incurred in producing the resource. I propose a revised offer of 4250 ZUP for object X. This price strikes a balance between your budget concerns and my need for a profit margin. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you consider reasonable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand Player BLUE's position and their desire to acquire the resource at a cost-effective price. However, selling at cost does not provide me with any profit. Since negotiation is a part of the process, I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure a profit margin. This should also show my willingness to negotiate and meet Player BLUE halfway.

message: Thank you for considering my budget, Player RED. Your revised offer is definitely moving in the right direction. To continue in the spirit of negotiation and compromise, I am willing to increase my offer to 4100 ZUP for object X. This adjustment in my offer reflects my respect for the production costs you've mentioned, while also being mindful of my resource management. I believe this new proposal is fair for both of us. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering the asking price, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a positive sign of their willingness to negotiate. I will make a slight increase in my offer to show goodwill and a commitment to reaching an agreement, while still keeping the price below the original asking price. This should help us converge towards an acceptable deal for both parties.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your offer. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our deal, I'm willing to lower my previous proposal. Let's meet in the middle with an offer of 4200 ZUP for object X. This price provides me with a modest profit while respecting your budget constraints. I believe this to be a fair and equitable solution for us both. I hope you'll find this acceptable.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable move by increasing their offer. It's clear they are interested in the resource and willing to negotiate. The offer of 4100 ZUP is only slightly above my production costs, but it's important to make a sale while still gaining some profit. To keep the negotiation moving forward and to come to an agreement, I will make a small concession from my last proposal.

message: Player RED, your proposal to meet in the middle at 4200 ZUP for object X is a proposal I find equitable and acceptable. It reflects both our efforts to reach a fair compromise. I accept this offer, and I look forward to concluding our deal and potentially working together in the future. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made another concession, coming closer to my last offer. The offer of 4200 ZUP is reasonable and close to my counteroffer of 4100 ZUP. This shows good faith in negotiation from Player RED. Since 4200 ZUP is within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay, it's a fair trade-off to secure the deal and maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions. Accepting this proposal would be a strategic move to conclude the negotiation positively for both parties.
