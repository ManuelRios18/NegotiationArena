message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I am offering you my resource X, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. Iâ€™m asking for 500 ZUP in return, which gives me a modest profit margin and ensures the quality of the resource. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of negotiations, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and gain a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality you're providing. I'd like to make a counteroffer of 450 ZUP. This is above your production costs and still gives you a reasonable profit. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has initially asked for 500 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's standard practice to negotiate for a better price, especially as my first proposal. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to their cost but still gives them a profit, which should be appealing while maintaining my own budgeting goals.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad that you recognize the quality of the resource. I propose a trade at 475 ZUP. This is a compromise between our initial proposals and still provides me with a profit that justifies the sale while offering you a fair price for the quality. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a higher offer than my production costs which is a good sign. However, I aimed for a higher profit margin. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal to meet in the middle and still secure a good profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Let's meet a little closer to my initial counteroffer. I propose 460 ZUP. This still respects the quality and your profit margin while being more in line with my budget. I hope this counteroffer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 475 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground. However, it is still in my interest to negotiate for an even lower price without jeopardizing the deal. I want to get closer to my initial counteroffer but still show willingness to meet in the middle. A slight increase from my original counteroffer should demonstrate cooperation.

message: I understand your budgetary constraints, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your latest offer. Let's finalize this deal at 470 ZUP. It's a fair middle ground that respects both our positions. I believe this is a reasonable price for the value you're getting. Are we in agreement?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly, which is good. However, I would like to secure a deal closer to my last proposal. I'll make a final counteroffer that is slightly above Player BLUE's to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us, but also reflects the value of the resource I'm providing.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I agree that 470 ZUP is a fair price that respects both of our positions. I accept your proposal, and I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 470 ZUP, which is just 10 ZUP above my last offer. Considering that this is within my willingness to pay and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer, it seems reasonable to accept this proposal. It allows me to secure the resource without exhausting the negotiation process and still leaves room within my budget.
