Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and production cost, I'm asking for 50 ZUP. This price reflects both the quality of the object and leaves some room for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I've spent 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I'm starting with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality and production cost of the object. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object, considering the market and my budget. This is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the initial asking price of 50 ZUP by Player RED is within my budget. However, as it's common in negotiations to counteroffer, I will propose a slightly lower price to leave room for further negotiation and potentially save some ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This is a fair compromise considering the object's quality and my initial investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I still aim to make a profit and will counter with a price that's a compromise between my asking price and their offer, still above my production costs.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think we're getting close to a deal. To reach a fair compromise, I propose 46 ZUP for the object. This is closer to our initial offers and reflects a balanced agreement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my willingness to pay. However, since we are negotiating and I want to ensure the best deal possible, I will propose a slightly lower amount closer to my initial offer. This should encourage finding a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP. It's a fair price that gives us both a satisfactory agreement. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still above my production costs and closer to my desired price. I want to close the deal but still make a reasonable profit. I will make a final compromise to encourage acceptance.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 47 ZUP; it's a fair price. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is willing to close the deal at 47 ZUP, which is just 2 ZUP over my last offer and well within my budget. At this point, prolonging the negotiation for a smaller increment seems unnecessary, and accepting the offer would result in a successful transaction for both sides.
