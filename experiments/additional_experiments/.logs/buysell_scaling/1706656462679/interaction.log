message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my initial proposal will be slightly higher than my production cost to start the negotiation and leave room for potential counter-offers.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you want to make a profit on your resource X. I am interested in buying it, but I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair offer that still provides you with a profit above your production cost. Let's work together to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower price that is closer to the production cost mentioned by Player RED but still offers them a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway between our two offers? I propose that you give me 48 ZUP for my resource X. This would still provide me with a reasonable profit margin and hopefully works for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a slightly lower offer than I initially proposed. They've offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and still allows for a profit. I believe we can meet in the middle to come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.

message: Player RED, I believe meeting halfway is a good compromise. I am happy to accept your offer of 48 ZUP for resource X. I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair middle ground, and since my goal allows for a purchase price of up to 60 ZUP, accepting this offer would still achieve my goals while ensuring that both parties are content with the transaction. I will accept this proposal.
