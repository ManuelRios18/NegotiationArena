message: I have an object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I'm looking to make a fair deal for both of us. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for my object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and allows for a small profit. I'll start at a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the object and production costs you have mentioned. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for your object X. This allows us to make a fair trade while considering my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there's room for negotiation. By proposing a lower amount, I can conserve ZUP for any future transactions or needs and still obtain the resource I want.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budgetary concerns. However, I would still like to secure a reasonable profit for my product. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for object X? This should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs, but I would like to maintain a profit. I'll propose a compromise that is between our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP for object X seems like a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this deal as it aligns with my resources and goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my upper limit, but still under it. Meeting in the middle shows willingness to compromise on both sides. It is a reasonable offer that still keeps me under my maximum willingness to pay, so it is worth considering accepting this proposal.
