message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object for sale. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade which allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I'm starting with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I consider the object valuable as well, but I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for the object, keeping in mind other potential costs and the market value. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the first offer and there is typically some room for negotiation. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a slightly lower profit in exchange for a guaranteed sale.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about other potential costs and market value. However, to ensure that I cover my production costs and gain a reasonable profit, how about we settle for 48 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production costs. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly higher price, but still lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I find your new proposal of 48 ZUP fair and acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my acceptable spending range for the resource. Since we are close to my maximum willingness to pay and to avoid the risk of losing the deal or prolonging the negotiation, which could result in even higher demands, it might be prudent to accept this offer. By closing the deal at this point, I ensure I get the resource for slightly less than my maximum limit.
