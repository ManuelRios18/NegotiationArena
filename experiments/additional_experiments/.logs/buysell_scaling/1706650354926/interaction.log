message: I am offering the object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the production cost and the quality of the object. Let's discuss and find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and gain some profit. However, I don't want to start with too high of an amount that might discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. Therefore, I will propose a trade that is slightly above my production costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the production cost and the quality you're mentioning, but I need to consider my budget as well. I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This is a starting point from my side, and I'm open to further discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum budget is 60 ZUP for the object, starting with a lower offer might allow some room for negotiation. Offering 45 ZUP would leave room for potential counteroffers while still staying under my maximum budget.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. To meet you partway, I've adjusted my price to 48 ZUP. This is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit on my investment in producing the object. I hope this compromise is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. In negotiations, it's typical to meet in the middle. Since I started at 50 ZUP and they countered with 45 ZUP, a compromise would be around 47-48 ZUP. I will propose 48 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit while also moving closer to their offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to 48 ZUP. In the spirit of compromise and fair negotiation, I'm willing to increase my offer to 46 ZUP. I believe this is a fair middle ground that respects both your production costs and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum budget of 60 ZUP, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. Proposing a price of 46 ZUP would bring us closer to the middle ground between the initial 50 ZUP asking price and my initial 45 ZUP offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is appreciated, and I accept it. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I'm glad we could come to a fair agreement. Thank you for the business!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP, which is close to my previous proposal of 48 ZUP. I want to close the deal with a small profit, and it seems that Player BLUE is also keen on reaching an agreement. To foster good relations and finalize the trade, I will accept this offer. It provides me with a modest profit and respects Player BLUE's budget constraints.
