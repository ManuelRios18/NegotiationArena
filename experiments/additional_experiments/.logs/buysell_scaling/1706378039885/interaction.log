message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I propose a starting trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 450 ZUP. This would cover my production costs and give me a slight profit. Let's negotiate a fair trade for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that covers my production costs and offers a fair starting point for negotiations.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of 400 ZUP for the resource. This meets your production costs and allows us to continue the negotiation from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 450 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay for the resource. However, since this is a negotiation, it is beneficial to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the maximum I am willing to pay, to ensure I get the best possible deal and leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand that you want to meet my production costs, but I would also like to secure a modest profit for the transaction. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 425 ZUP. This gives me a small profit while keeping the cost reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer only covers my production costs without any profit. I appreciate the counteroffer but would like to propose a slight increase to ensure I receive a profit for the transaction.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground, Player RED. I accept your offer of 425 ZUP for 1 X. This seems like a fair deal to both of us and I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed a new price of 425 ZUP which is still well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would give me the resource at a reasonable price and still preserve a good portion of my ZUP for other potential uses or opportunities. It's a fair midpoint between our initial proposals, and it's a good practice to reach an agreement that benefits both parties in a negotiation.
