message: Dear Player RED, thank you for your initial offer. Considering the need to ensure a fair trade for both parties, I would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP for the resource X.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Although my maximum willing payment is 60 ZUP, I should start the negotiation at a lower price to leave room for negotiation and potentially achieve a better deal.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair trade and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose a revised offer of 45 ZUP for resource X. This price allows for fairness to both sides while giving me a modest return on my investment. I am open to your thoughts on this adjusted proposal.

my resources: X: 1

message: Dear Player RED, thank you for showing flexibility in your pricing. I value the quality of the resource you offer and in the spirit of reaching an agreement, I am willing to increase my offer to 42 ZUP for resource X. I hope this revised offer reflects our mutual interest in a fair and successful trade. Awaiting your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is a fair move towards the middle ground between our initial proposals. Since this price is within my maximum willing payment range, and to show my willingness to conclude the trade amicably, I will adjust my offer upwards while still trying to negotiate a better deal than the current offer.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I am pleased with your revised offer of 42 ZUP for resource X. I believe it is a fair price that covers my costs while also providing value to you. I accept your offer and look forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which now covers my production cost. Since my primary goal is to sell at a price that covers my costs, I am inclined to accept this offer. Making a small profit is acceptable, and I should secure the sale without risking a breakdown in negotiations with further counteroffers that may be too high for Player BLUE.
