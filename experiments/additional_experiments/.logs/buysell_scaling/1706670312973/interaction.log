message: I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to propose a starting trade where you give me 450000 ZUP for it, allowing for a reasonable profit margin on my end. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I want to make a profit, so I will start the proposal slightly above my production costs to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for profit, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 420000 ZUP for the resource X. This still gives you a 20000 ZUP profit and allows me to save some resources for future investments. Let's work together to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 450000 ZUP, which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources if possible. I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to the production cost, but still provides a profit for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I can appreciate your position and your need to save resources for the future. However, I would like to meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about we settle on 435000 ZUP for the resource X? This way, we both benefit from the deal, with me still making a profit and you saving some ZUP for other investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 420000 ZUP which is above my production costs and still provides a profit, but it's below my initial asking price. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above their offer to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed amount of 435000 ZUP for resource X. It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy we could reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new amount of 435000 ZUP, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price is still within my budget, and I am willing to accept this to secure the resource and maintain a good trading relationship.
