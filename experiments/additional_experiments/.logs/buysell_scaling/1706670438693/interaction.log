message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose that you give me 450000 ZUP for it. This price accounts for the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin for a product of this caliber. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 400000 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even or make a profit. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the object X you're offering. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 400000 ZUP, considering the broad market and competition. This offer is aligned with the current market rates and still provides you with a profit over your production costs. Let's work together to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is a good strategy to propose a lower amount first to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern about the market conditions, but I would like to seek a modest profit for the object X. I have reduced my initial ask to 425000 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise. This price gives me a slight profit for my investment while remaining competitive in the market. I hope we can agree on this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to match my production cost without providing any profit. As my goal is to make a profit, I will counter with a reduced amount, still above the production cost. This should entice Player BLUE to consider the value of the object while allowing me some profit.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the adjusted price, Player RED. I believe we are getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a new offer of 410000 ZUP. This is a competitive price that still acknowledges the value of your product while respecting the market dynamics. I hope this revised offer aligns with our shared goal of finalizing a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer is within my budget, but I believe there is still room for a slight reduction to ensure the best possible deal. I will counter with an increased offer, coming closer to RED's proposal but still below it to maintain negotiation leverage.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your new offer and our progress towards a deal. To meet halfway, I propose a final trade of 417500 ZUP for the object X. This price considers both the quality of the product and the current market situation, ensuring a fair and equitable trade. I believe this is a competitive and justifiable price point for both parties. Let's close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 417500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. However, the offer is only slightly above my production cost. To ensure a fair trade that provides me with a reasonable profit while also appeasing Player BLUE, I will make a final counteroffer that splits the difference between my last proposal and their offer.
