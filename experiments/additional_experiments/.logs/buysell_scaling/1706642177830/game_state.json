You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP for 1X. This is a fair compromise, and since it's within my budget, I am inclined to accept this deal. Accepting the offer at 47 ZUP allows me to save 13 ZUP from my maximum willingness to pay, which can be used for other purposes or future transactions. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I agree to your proposal of 47 ZUP for 1X. This seems like a fair price, and I'm happy we could reach an agreement. Let's finalize the deal at this price. </message>"
