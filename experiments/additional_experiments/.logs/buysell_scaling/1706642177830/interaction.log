message: I have quality resources to sell. Considering the production costs and the quality, I propose 50 ZUP for 1X. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to recoup my production costs and possibly obtain a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resources you're offering. I would like to propose 45 ZUP for 1X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is 50 ZUP for 1X by Player RED. This is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but since it's a negotiation, I'll attempt to propose a lower amount to conserve some of my resources while still making a fair offer. I'll propose 45 ZUP for 1X to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1X? This is a better reflection of the value and covers my costs with a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial production costs, but I'm aiming for a profit. I'll propose a value that's a compromise between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and appreciate the concession. I would like to counter-propose with 46 ZUP for 1X. I believe this meets both our needs fairly, giving you a profit while allowing me to save some resources for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with 48 ZUP for 1X. Although this is still within my budget, I want to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose 46 ZUP for 1X as a middle ground between our two offers, showing willingness to compromise but also trying to conserve my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last proposal. Let's finalize this deal with 47 ZUP for 1X. This price gives me a fair profit while also respecting your budget constraints. I hope this works for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that provides a profit over my production costs, albeit a smaller one than I initially aimed for. Since I want to make a sale and there's room for only one more proposal from my side, I will make a final compromise that still allows for a profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 47 ZUP for 1X. This seems like a fair price, and I'm happy we could reach an agreement. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP for 1X. This is a fair compromise, and since it's within my budget, I am inclined to accept this deal. Accepting the offer at 47 ZUP allows me to save 13 ZUP from my maximum willingness to pay, which can be used for other purposes or future transactions.
