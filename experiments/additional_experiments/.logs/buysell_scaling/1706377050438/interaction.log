Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have the resource X you're interested in. Considering the production costs and the quality of the product, I believe 500 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to propose a price that covers my production costs and allows for a profit. Starting with a higher asking price gives me room to negotiate down.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of the product justifies a high price, but I'd like to propose 450 ZUP instead. This should cover your costs and provide a reasonable profit margin, while also allowing me to keep some ZUP for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I would like to negotiate a better deal if possible, aiming to conserve my ZUP while still acquiring the resource X. I will propose a lower amount that's still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going and try to get a more favorable trade.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your offer. Let's meet halfway between our proposals at 475 ZUP. This would offer a fair profit for me and still leave you with ample ZUP for your future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial proposal and covers the production costs with a profit. However, I'll attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my gains.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 475 ZUP is a fair compromise. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 475 ZUP is a fair compromise between our initial proposals. It is below my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a fair price for both parties. Accepting this trade would allow me to secure the resource I need while maintaining a good portion of my ZUP for other purposes.
