message: I have an object X for sale that cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it at a price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Would you be interested in purchasing it for 450,000 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I would like to recoup my costs on the production of the resource X, so I will set an initial asking price slightly above my costs to allow room for negotiation.

message: I understand that you are looking to cover your costs and make a profit. I am interested in your object X and would like to suggest a price of 425,000 ZUP, which is above your production cost and should give you a decent profit margin. Let's work together to find a price that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 450,000 ZUP, which is within my budget of 600,000 ZUP. However, as a negotiating strategy, I will propose a counter-offer to see if I can acquire the item for a lower price, maximizing my resources. I will make my first proposal at a price that is above their cost but below their asking price.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. A fair compromise to me seems to be 430,000 ZUP. This figure is halfway between our offers and should still provide you with a solid profit while remaining a good deal for me. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 435,000 ZUP, which is still within my budget. While their offer is reasonable, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a slightly better price that is closer to my initial counteroffer. I will propose a price that splits the difference between our two offers to move the negotiation forward.
