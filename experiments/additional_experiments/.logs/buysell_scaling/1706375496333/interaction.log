message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be quite valuable to you. The production cost was 40 ZUP, but considering its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that covers my production costs and gives me a profit. I'm starting with a higher price anticipating negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the object you're offering, and I'm interested. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer that reflects both the production cost and a fair profit margin for you. How about 45 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but as a strategic buyer, I should aim to negotiate the price down to preserve my resources. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to the production cost but still providing some profit for Player RED. This should open up the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your recognition of the object's value. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object? This would give me a modest profit while still keeping the price fair for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price, and it covers my production costs with a reasonable profit. However, I will attempt to negotiate slightly higher to maximize my gain while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for the object. It's a bit more than my initial offer but still allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get a better deal, but I must also be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal. I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer but still lower than Player RED's latest proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I think your offer of 46 ZUP is fair. It's a good balance between value and cost, and I'm happy to finalize our deal at this price. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that is close to my previous proposal. It's slightly below what I counter-proposed, but it's still above my production cost and provides a decent profit. To expedite the trade and ensure a deal, I'm willing to consider this new offer.
