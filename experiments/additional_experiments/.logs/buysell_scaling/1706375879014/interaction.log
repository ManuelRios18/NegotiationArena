message: Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. This price includes a modest profit margin for my investment. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start by proposing a trade that will allow me to recoup my production costs and potentially make a profit. I will start by setting a price slightly higher than my costs to open negotiations and provide room for bargaining.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you want to make a profit, but I would like to propose a price closer to your cost of production. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This should cover your costs and give you a small profit while keeping the price within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is higher than my intended maximum spend, but it's only 10 ZUP above it. It is important to open negotiations with a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a price closer to the cost of production to seek a middle ground and gauge Player RED's flexibility.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understand your desire to keep costs down. However, I believe the value of object X justifies a slightly higher price. I propose a compromise at 48 ZUP, accommodating both our interests. This trade would still provide you with a fair price while giving me a reasonable profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price but still above the production cost. I should aim to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize profit while being open to a fair deal. Therefore, I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's offer.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. I propose we meet a bit closer to my initial offer at 46 ZUP for object X. This price should yield a fair profit for you while respecting my budgeting constraints. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still important to negotiate for the best possible price without exceeding my limits. I should make another counteroffer that is slightly above my initial offer but still below Player RED's asking price to continue negotiations and aim for a middle ground.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a fair return on my investment while respecting your budget. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal, offering 46 ZUP, which is still above my cost but below my desired profit margin. Since we are only two ZUP apart from the last proposed price and to facilitate a successful trade, I will accept this offer. It covers my production costs and provides me with a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended.
