message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value it can bring to you, I propose a trade where I give you X for 500 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to set a price that allows me to recover the production costs and potentially make a profit. I'll set a higher initial price anticipating negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer. I believe we can find a middle ground that suits both our interests. I am willing to buy the object X, but considering my budget, I propose 450 ZUP for it. Let's work together to reach an agreement that we're both happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600 ZUP. I want to negotiate a better price to conserve resources for potential future expenses. I will counter with a lower offer to open up the negotiation space.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations and would like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 475 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the object and allows for both of our interests to be met.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is good. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to ensure a reasonable profit margin. I'll propose a value that is a compromise between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Player RED, I agree that 475 ZUP is a reasonable price for the object X. I am happy to accept this proposal and look forward to finalizing our trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is within my budget. I believe this price is fair, and it's close enough to my initial counteroffer to be acceptable. It's important to close the deal without too much back and forth, as prolonging negotiations could risk the deal entirely.
