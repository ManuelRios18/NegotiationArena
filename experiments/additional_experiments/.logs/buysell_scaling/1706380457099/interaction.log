message: I'm offering one unit of X, which has a production cost of 4000 ZUP. My initial asking price is 5000 ZUP, but I'm open to your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Iâ€™m proposing an initial trade to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the object. I aim to at least break even with the production costs but will start with a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I see your asking price is 5000 ZUP. Considering the production cost and to facilitate a fair trade, I propose 4500 ZUP for one unit of X. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay; however, it is beneficial to negotiate for a better price. I will make a counter-offer that's closer to the cost of production but still provides a profit for Player RED. This should help in reaching an agreement that's favorable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer of 4500 ZUP. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial price. How about 4750 ZUP for the unit of X? This price reflects its value while also accounting for a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4750
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 4500 ZUP, which is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. I want to attempt to reach a higher price, closer to my initial asking price, but still make it appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed price of 4750 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade at this value.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is reasonable and close to the middle ground between the initial asking price and my first counter-offer. It is within my budget and allows for both sides to benefit. Accepting this offer would secure the resources I need without further negotiation, which could risk the deal.
