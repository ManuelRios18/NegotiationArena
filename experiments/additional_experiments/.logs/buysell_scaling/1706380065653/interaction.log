message: I'm offering object X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I believe 4500 ZUP is a fair price considering the production costs and the value it provides.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least my production costs for the object X. I'll start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your production costs. However, I would like to propose a price of 4000 ZUP for object X. This price also includes a fair margin above your production costs, ensuring you make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate for a better price. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to compromise.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to ensure a fair deal. I've reduced my initial asking price to 4200 ZUP. This accounts for my production costs and provides me with a modest profit margin. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount of my production costs, which is acceptable but does not account for any profit. In the interest of negotiation, I will counter with a slightly higher amount, but still lower than my initial asking price to move towards a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a lower price. To move closer to an agreement, I propose we settle at 4100 ZUP. This still gives you a profit and is a price I'm more comfortable with. I believe this is a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4100
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is still within my acceptable range. However, I think there may be an opportunity to secure a better deal. I will make another counteroffer closer to my initial proposal to see if we can meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 4100 ZUP is acceptable to me. It provides a fair profit margin and I am happy to proceed with this sale. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that gives me a small profit. This is close to my production costs, and while it's less than my last proposal, it's a reasonable compromise that allows me to make a profit without prolonging the negotiation. I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid potentially losing the deal.
