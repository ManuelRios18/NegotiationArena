message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe the fair price for this would be 450 ZUP, considering the production costs and the value it may provide to you. Let's negotiate a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 400 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make sure I can recover my investment and ideally make some profit. For the initial proposal, I will set a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: 
Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your production costs, but I would be more comfortable with a price that's closer to those costs. I propose 400 ZUP for the resource. This price should cover your production costs while also leaving room for us to find a middle ground.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it would be advantageous to negotiate a better deal, closer to the production cost. Starting lower gives me room to negotiate upwards while still trying to maintain the best possible price.

message: I appreciate your consideration of the production costs, Player BLUE. However, as a business, I need to secure a small profit to sustain my operations. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions? I propose a price of 425 ZUP for the resource. This allows me to cover costs and recognize a modest profit, while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE wants to pay the exact cost of production, but as a seller, I need to ensure some profit to justify the sale. I will make a counteroffer that is between my initial asking price and their offer to find a compromise.

Thank you for your understanding and your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. I propose a slightly lower price of 415 ZUP for the resource. This price should give you a profit over the production costs while still being a good deal for both of us. I believe this could be a fair compromise.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to their desired profit margin. The offer is still within my acceptable range, and meeting halfway is a common negotiation strategy. Accepting this proposal would secure the resource for a reasonable price. However, it might be beneficial to attempt one more round of negotiation to see if a slightly better price can be reached, while still keeping the final price within my goals.
