Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price, providing me with a small profit while offering you the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that aims to cover the cost of production and also make a profit. However, it should not be too high as to discourage the buyer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, however, I would like to counter with 45 ZUP. This would still give you a profit over your cost, and it's closer to the amount I have budgeted for this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED wants to make a profit, but I also want to negotiate a better deal considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP leaves room for further negotiation while being closer to my target purchase price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I acknowledge your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle and settle on 48 ZUP. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is reasonable and still allows for a profit. However, I will propose a slightly higher amount to try and maximize my earnings while still maintaining a good chance of closing the deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer to meet in the middle at 48 ZUP is fair, and I am willing to accept this compromise. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Making a smaller counteroffer could continue the negotiation, potentially leading to an even more favorable outcome. However, the offer of 48 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget, and further negotiation could risk the deal falling through.
