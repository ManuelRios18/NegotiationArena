message: I am offering 1 unit of X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the costs and the quality of the resource, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and provide a profit. The initial offer will be higher than my costs to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of your resource and your production costs. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to leave some room for additional transactions in the future. Let's find a balance that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation, and there is room to propose a counteroffer. I will propose a trade at 45 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price while still offering a price above their stated cost of production.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for future transactions. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X, securing a modest profit for me and a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production costs, but I want to secure a profit. I will propose a middle ground that is above my costs and slightly below my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a great approach. I propose we go for 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should give you a reasonable profit while also maintaining a good value for me, ensuring we both benefit from this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is a negotiation and we're close to my initial counteroffer, I will attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal without exhausting the negotiation process. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is still above their cost and closer to my initial counteroffer, hoping they see it as a fair middle ground.

newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is acceptable as it covers my production costs and provides me with a profit. It is only 1 ZUP less than my previous proposal, so it is a fair middle ground.
