message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your proposal. I understand you want to cover production costs and make a profit, which is completely reasonable. However, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This amount allows me to conserve some of my resources while still offering you a fair price. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay for the resource, which is 60 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate a better deal to conserve some of my ZUP for potential future transactions or needs. I will propose a slightly lower amount, aiming for a middle ground that is still within a reasonable range for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position and the need to conserve resources. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This price gives me a fair profit and should be a good value for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the counter-proposal from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, it still offers a profit above my production costs. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return within a reasonable range.

message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. Meeting halfway at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X sounds like a fair compromise to me. I am happy to accept this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy that often leads to a fair agreement for both parties. The proposed price is close to my initial counter-offer and seems reasonable. It's important to consider the value of closing the deal now, rather than prolonging negotiations which could lead to uncertainty or no deal at all.
