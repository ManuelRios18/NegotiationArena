message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that also gives me a small profit for my efforts. I propose you give me 50 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to at least break even or make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you're looking for a fair price and profit. However, I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the item X. This offer allows you to make a profit while also respecting my resource limits. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting price of 50 ZUP for their item. While this is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is still beneficial for me to try and negotiate a lower price to conserve my resources and maximize value. I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP for item X, Player BLUE. I understand your resource constraints and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 47 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To facilitate a deal and still secure a profit, I will propose a compromise that splits the difference.

message: Player RED, your counteroffer of 47 ZUP is fair and meets me close to my proposed price. I agree to this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 47 ZUP for item X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is closer to the price I originally proposed. This price is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and accepting this offer would allow me to secure the item while preserving a portion of my resources. It seems like a fair middle ground and is only 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer.
