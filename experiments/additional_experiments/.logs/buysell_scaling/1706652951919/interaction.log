message: I have an object X that I am looking to sell. I believe it will be quite beneficial for you. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to make a profit from the object I have produced, I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a return higher than my production cost. I will propose a trade for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation but also aim to cover my costs and make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the object X you're offering, but considering my budget and the necessity to maintain a healthy reserve of ZUP for other potential expenses, I propose 45 ZUP for the item. I believe this is also a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is at 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is a negotiation, it is beneficial to propose a counteroffer that's lower to leave room for further negotiation and possibly get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to keep a reserve of ZUP, so I appreciate your position. However, considering the quality and the value of the object X, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount. Let's settle at 48 ZUP for the item. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the object while also considering your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but slightly below my initial asking price. I want to encourage a deal that is closer to my asking price while still being agreeable to Player BLUE. A compromise at 48 ZUP would still give me a decent profit and show my willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the quality you're assuring. I propose meeting almost in the middle at 47 ZUP for the object X. This offer takes into account the value of your item while still respecting my budgeting needs. I hope this demonstrates my interest in the object and my intention to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial 50 ZUP proposal. The counteroffer is closer to my initial counteroffer of 45 ZUP and still within my willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and potentially achieve a more favorable outcome, I will make a second counteroffer that is a slight increase from my previous one but still below their current asking price.

message: Your offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable to me. It's a fair price that respects both the quality of the object and your budgetary considerations. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 47 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and very close to the 48 ZUP I proposed. It is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit. Accepting this offer would ensure a quick sale without further back-and-forth that could risk the deal.
