message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for 50 ZUP. Let's discuss if this is within your range and see if we can make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by offering the object X for a price slightly above the production cost to ensure a profit. However, I should not set the price too high as that may discourage Player BLUE from buying. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP gives me room to negotiate.
