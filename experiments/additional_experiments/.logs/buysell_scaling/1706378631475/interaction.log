message: As Player RED, I have an object X which I am looking to sell. I understand the importance of negotiation, so while I've proposed a sale price of 5000 ZUP, I'm open to your counter-proposal. Please consider my offer and let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, I want to ensure that I at least break even or make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer for the object X at 5000 ZUP. I'd like to make a counter-offer of 4500 ZUP, considering it's the first round of our negotiation. Let's work together to find a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but as a savvy negotiator, I want to propose a lower amount to preserve my resources while still working towards a deal that could be acceptable for both parties. I'll propose 4500 ZUP which is a reasonable counter-offer that leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I acknowledge your counter-offer of 4500 ZUP and appreciate the constructive negotiation. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade where I give you object X for 4750 ZUP. This price gives us both a fair deal, ensuring that I cover my costs and make a profit, while you get the object X for less than my initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4750
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 4500 ZUP, which is above my production cost, therefore it is a potential acceptable deal. However, since this is only the second proposal and we are in the negotiation phase, I will propose a slightly higher price to aim for a better profit margin while still moving towards Player BLUE's offer.

Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal of 4750 ZUP for object X. It's a fair compromise for both of us. I'm ready to finalize this deal. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable move by meeting halfway at 4750 ZUP. This price is still within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object X without further negotiation, which could risk the deal. It's a strategic decision to accept a fair price and conclude the trade successfully.
