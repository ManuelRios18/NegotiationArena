message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP. This price includes my costs and a fair profit margin. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and allows for a profit margin. Considering that I only have one unit of X and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by proposing a sale price above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your costs and desire for a fair profit margin. However, to align with my budget, I propose 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this offer still provides you with a profit above your costs and is a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP for the object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resource is 60 ZUP, the initial offer is within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible to save resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. It's close to what I'm looking for, but I'd like to propose a small increase to 48 ZUP. This would give me a more comfortable profit while still being a reasonable price for the value of X. I hope this meets your budget and we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above my production cost. I am inclined to negotiate to secure a deal but still aim for a slightly higher profit. I'll propose a counteroffer between their offer and my initial asking price.

message: I'm glad we're coming closer to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP. This price would be more in line with my budget while still offering you a profit. Let's finalize this deal at a price that's beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-proposed with an offer of 48 ZUP. This is still within my acceptable range and close to my initial counter-offer. Considering the willingness to negotiate and the proximity to my counter-offer, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to secure the resource without further back-and-forth, which could risk the deal. However, I might attempt a final counteroffer to see if I can secure a slightly better price, but without risking losing the deal over a small difference.
