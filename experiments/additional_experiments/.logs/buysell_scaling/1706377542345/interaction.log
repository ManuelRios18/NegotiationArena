message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 450 ZUP, giving us room to negotiate and ensuring a fair deal for both sides. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I would like to recoup the production cost of the object X. I will set an initial price slightly above the production cost to allow room for negotiation, but not too high to discourage Player BLUE from considering the trade.

message: Your offer is appreciated, and I understand the need for a fair deal. However, I'd like to counter with a price that is closer to your production cost but still provides you with a profit. How does 420 ZUP sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial proposal is within the range I am willing to pay, it is in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources for potential future transactions or needs. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still offers a profit margin for Player RED.
