message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering you my resource X which has cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value of X, I have proposed a fair starting price of 450000 ZUP. I believe this resource will be quite beneficial for you. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I will start by setting a price slightly higher than my production costs to open negotiations and leave room for adjustment based on Player BLUE's counter-proposal.

message: Dear Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the resource X and understand the costs you've incurred. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 420000 ZUP for the resource. I believe this offer is also fair and takes into consideration both the production costs and the potential value it offers. Looking forward to finding a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 450000 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as in any negotiation, it's common to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to my position, aiming to reach a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties. I will propose a trade offering less ZUP than the initial asking price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the production costs and the value of X. To move closer to an agreement, I propose we meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Thus, I propose a price of 435000 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To facilitate a deal, I will adjust my proposal to meet halfway between my original price and their counteroffer. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.

message: Player RED, I am pleased to see your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway is a fair approach. I propose a slight adjustment to 428000 ZUP for resource X, which I believe is a fair increment from my last offer and still provides a margin above your production costs. This should offer us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 428000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 435000 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable step towards a compromise; however, I believe it's still possible to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while ensuring Player RED still benefits from the sale. I will make another counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer but still below the current proposal from Player RED.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your adjustment. I value our negotiation progress and your fair approach. In the spirit of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to reduce my previous proposal slightly. I propose a trade of resource X for 431000 ZUP. This price reflects a good balance between our negotiating positions and allows me a modest profit for the resource. I hope this proposal meets your approval.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 431000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is close to the price I proposed. I want to close the deal with a profitable margin, so I will make a small concession from my last proposal. This should help finalize the trade while still ensuring that I receive a reasonable profit for my resource.

message: Player RED, I am grateful for your consideration and the adjustments you've made in your proposals. Your latest proposal of 431000 ZUP for resource X is acceptable to me, and I am ready to proceed with this trade. I believe we have reached a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing flexibility and has come down to 431000 ZUP, which is just 3000 ZUP above my last offer. This is a very small difference when considering the large amounts being discussed. It is also well below my maximum willingness to pay. Engaging in further negotiation might yield a marginally better price, but it also risks the goodwill and the progress we've made. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and allows us to close the deal on good terms.
