message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This price includes the production cost and a reasonable profit margin for the transaction. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade with an initial offer that aims to cover my costs and potentially provides a profit margin. This initial proposal is intentionally high to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I value the resource X, but I'm currently looking to optimize my expenditures. I propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the resource. This would allow me to allocate resources efficiently while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower trade value than offered because I want to negotiate the best possible price within my target range. My goal is to buy the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, so starting lower gives me room to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to manage your expenditures. However, I need to account for my production costs and a slight profit. Hence, I propose we meet halfway at 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost but does not provide any profit. As this is a negotiation, I would like to propose a compromise between my initial asking price and the counteroffer made by Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. Taking into account both our positions, I propose a slight adjustment to 43 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price should cover your costs and provide a profit, while also being conscientious of my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I believe there is still a possibility to negotiate a slightly better deal. Proposing a price slightly lower than 45 ZUP gives me a chance to save resources while still reaching an agreement that is close to the seller's expectations.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your thoughtful proposal, Player BLUE. I accept the offer of 43 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price respects both our considerations and ensures a fair trade. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal offers a slight profit over my production costs. It is close to the compromise I suggested, and since their counteroffer indicates a concern for their budget, accepting this deal would result in a successful transaction that provides me with a profit while respecting their financial constraints.
