message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to sell my resource X, which has a production cost of 400 ZUP. I believe that a fair trade considering its value would be 500 ZUP. What do you think about this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to propose a price that gives me a profit over the production cost. I will start by proposing a trade at a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I see your point and appreciate the offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 450 ZUP for the resource X, considering that I might need some ZUP for future transactions as well. I believe this is still a fair offer that takes into account your production costs and the value of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is always good to attempt to negotiate a better deal, especially for the first proposal. I will propose a lower amount, but still within a reasonable range so as to show genuine interest in purchasing the resource.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 450 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand your need to conserve ZUP for future transactions. How about we meet in the middle at 475 ZUP? This price would still give you room for future activities while allowing me to gain a reasonable profit for my resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 450 ZUP. This is above my production cost, but still lower than my initial asking price. It's a reasonable counteroffer, but I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still making it an attractive deal for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose we settle at 460 ZUP for the resource X. This price should allow for a fair profit for you while also respecting my budget constraints. I hope this can be a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED is reasonable and close to the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. The proposed price of 475 ZUP is within my budget. Making a small concession could lead to a successful deal without exhausting the negotiation process early on. However, I will attempt one more negotiation to see if I can secure an even more favorable trade.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation and I find your offer of 460 ZUP acceptable. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Looking forward to future transactions with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer of 460 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. This offer is close to the split-the-difference price I proposed previously. Considering it's important to close the deal without dragging on the negotiation and risk losing the sale, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a guaranteed profit.
