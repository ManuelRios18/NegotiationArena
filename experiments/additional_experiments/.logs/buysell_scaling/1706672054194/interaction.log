message: I am offering one unit of X, which cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and quality, I believe a price of 450,000 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my initial goal is to recover at least the production cost of the resource I am selling. I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the costs involved in production. However, I would like to propose 420,000 ZUP for your resource, considering the market and the value it offers. Let's find a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willing price, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since there's room to do so. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open up the negotiation and see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer of 420,000 ZUP. I understand the need to find a mutually beneficial deal. I propose we meet in the middle at 435,000 ZUP for the resource. This amount would fairly compensate the production costs and provide value to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 420,000 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To continue the negotiation in good faith and try to reach a compromise, I will make a counter-proposal splitting the difference between our two offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I believe your counteroffer of 435,000 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and the proposed amount is a reasonable compromise. It's closer to the initial asking price, but still saves me some ZUP compared to their starting offer. Accepting this offer would secure the resource without further back-and-forth, considering that the price is fair and within my budget.
