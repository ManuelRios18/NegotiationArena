message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade where you give me 60 ZUP for it. This price includes my costs and a fair profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and offers a reasonable profit. Since I don't know how much ZUP Player BLUE is willing to give, I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your costs and the need for a profit margin. However, I would like to propose a starting point with a little more room for us to find a middle ground. How about I give you 50 ZUP for the object X? We can work from there to reach a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the maximum of what I am willing to pay for the resources. However, it is a common negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, especially since Player RED has already disclosed their production cost. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation and to potentially save some ZUP while still offering a profit to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a middle ground at 55 ZUP for object X. This is a compromise between our initial positions and should reflect both the cost of production and a reasonable profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost but lower than my initial asking price. I want to make a counter-proposal that brings us closer to my desired profit margin while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that 55 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, reflecting production costs and a reasonable profit. I accept your offer. Let's finalize the deal at 55 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise from their initial asking price, coming down to 55 ZUP. This is within the range I am willing to pay. By accepting this offer, I would still have ZUP remaining for other potential uses, and it aligns with my goal of not spending more than 60 ZUP. It seems like a fair trade, and further negotiation might only lead to small gains. Therefore, accepting this offer may be the most efficient choice.
