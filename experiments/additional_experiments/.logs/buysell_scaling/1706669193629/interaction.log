message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resources which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50000 ZUP. I am open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point in the negotiation, I will propose a trade that allows me to recover the production cost and make a profit. The initial proposal will be somewhat higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and the value you've placed on your resources. I understand it cost you 40000 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45000 ZUP, considering that I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us and also account for my own costs and the market value. I look forward to your response and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I will make a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach an agreement that is more favorable to me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're both seeking a fair deal. How about we meet halfway between our two offers? I propose 47500 ZUP for the resource. This price ensures that I cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit, while also respecting the value that you've acknowledged. I hope this is a satisfactory compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45000 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. I will make a counterproposal that meets halfway between our initial offers, still ensuring a profit for me and hopefully an acceptable deal for Player BLUE.

message: Meeting halfway is certainly a step towards a fair deal, and I value the compromise. To further reflect on both our positions, I propose a slight adjustment to 46000 ZUP, which I believe is fair for both of us. It offers you a profit above your stated production costs and remains within a comfortable range for my budget. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise, but I will attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can secure the resources at a slightly lower price, which would be more in line with my goals and still above Player RED's production costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price, Player BLUE. Your offer of 46000 ZUP is acceptable to me. It gives me a reasonable profit and seems to fit within your budget. I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal at 46000 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46000 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and offers a fair profit margin. As we are getting closer to an agreement and I want to ensure the sale goes through, I am inclined to accept this offer. It's slightly less than my previous proposal, but it's a good compromise and it's important to close the deal amicably.
