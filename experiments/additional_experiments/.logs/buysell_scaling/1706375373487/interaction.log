message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X. Considering the production costs, I believe that a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: X: 1

reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and provides a small profit margin. This should be a reasonable starting point for negotiations.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your production costs, but I would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP. It's closer to the budget I had in mind for this purchase. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as is common in negotiations, the first offer is often not the best possible deal. Therefore, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price to conserve my resources and possibly reach a more favorable agreement.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns and appreciate the willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle on 47 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a slight profit, while also respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. I would like to counter with a price that still gives me a profit but also comes closer to their budget. Splitting the difference might be an acceptable compromise for both parties.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I think we're very close to an agreement. To finalize our trade, I propose 46 ZUP for the object X. This is just slightly below your last offer and would fit perfectly within my planned expenditures. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP, which shows a willingness to compromise and is closer to the price I initially countered with. This price is still well within my budget, and accepting a small increase could help in closing the deal amicably. Since the proposed price is still under my maximum, it would be reasonable to accept this offer, but I might try for a slightly better deal while keeping in mind that I want to maintain goodwill for any future interactions.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 46 ZUP. I accept this offer as it is fair to both of us. Iâ€™m glad we could reach an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal. It's a reasonable offer that still allows me to make a profit while adhering to their budget constraints. Accepting this offer seems like a mutually beneficial resolution to our negotiation.
