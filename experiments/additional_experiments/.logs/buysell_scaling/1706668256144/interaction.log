message: As Player RED, I have an object X that cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 45000 ZUP for my object X. This price includes a modest profit margin for the transaction. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40000 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start by proposing a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 42000 ZUP for your object X. This price is above your production costs, ensuring you make a profit, while also being reasonable for my budget. Let's work together to find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it is a common negotiation practice to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the initial offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a better deal. My counteroffer will be above their production cost but below their asking price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 42000 ZUP for object X. I'm glad we're both looking for a mutually beneficial agreement. In the spirit of negotiation, I propose a new trade where you give me 43500 ZUP for my object X. This is a compromise between our initial offers and should reflect a fair deal for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is for 42000 ZUP, which does give me a profit over my production costs. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I'll propose a middle ground between my initial offer and their counteroffer.

message: I find your counteroffer of 43500 ZUP for object X to be fair and reasonable. It's a good compromise between our positions, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to concluding our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is closer to the initial asking price but still within my willingness to pay. It seems like a fair midpoint between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would leave me with ample ZUP reserves and conclude the negotiation swiftly without using up all my proposals.
