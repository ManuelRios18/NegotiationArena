message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 500 ZUP for this object. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am looking to make a profit on my investment, so I will start by proposing a price above my production cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your initial proposal. I understand that the object X cost you 400 ZUP to produce, and while I'm interested in acquiring it, I would like to make a counteroffer that reflects both the production cost and a reasonable profit for you. Would you consider accepting 450 ZUP for object X? This offer is a bit closer to your production cost but still provides you with a profit margin. I'm open to further negotiation if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 500 ZUP for the object X. Since the object cost them 400 ZUP to produce, they are looking for a profit. My goal is to buy the resource for no more than 600 ZUP, so their offer is within my range. However, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal closer to the cost of production while also considering a fair markup for Player RED. My counteroffer will aim to reduce the price slightly while maintaining a fair trade for both parties.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer of 450 ZUP. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How about we settle on 475 ZUP for object X? This price allows for a fair profit margin for me while also being a reasonable increase from your offer. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you have another counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. A counteroffer will be made with a small reduction from my initial asking price, but still above the offered 450 ZUP.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your willingness to meet halfway. I believe that 475 ZUP for object X is a fair deal for both of us. I am happy to accept this offer. Looking forward to concluding this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 475 ZUP, which is a compromise between our two offers. This price is still within my range, and their willingness to meet halfway shows a good-faith effort towards a fair deal. Since the price is reasonable and close to the production cost, and considering that I am willing to pay up to 600 ZUP, accepting this offer could be beneficial. I will accept this offer as it is a fair price for both parties and allows me to secure the object X for below my maximum willingness to pay.
