message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be of value to you. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that reflects its production cost and the value it provides. I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I'm open to negotiations if this initial offer doesn't suit you. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that will give me a profit over my production costs, while also leaving room for negotiation, so I will ask for more than my production costs.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit closer to what I had in mind for the purchase, and I believe it's still a reasonable price that respects the value you’ve mentioned. Let’s work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since the initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, it's a good starting point for negotiation. However, it's in my interest to propose a lower price to conserve my resources while also leaving room for further negotiation. I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground between our positions.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 1 unit of X for 48 ZUP. This price would give me a modest profit and still offer you the object at a reasonable price. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is good. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to ensure a better profit margin. I'll propose a compromise between the initial offer and their counteroffer.

message: I appreciate the compromise, Player RED. Meeting in the middle sounds like a fair deal for both parties. I accept your proposal of 1 unit of X for 48 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to finalizing the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The new offer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and the suggested compromise is a fair one. By accepting this offer, I secure the object for a price within my budget while also allowing Player RED to make a profit. This seems like a mutually beneficial outcome, so I will accept this offer.
