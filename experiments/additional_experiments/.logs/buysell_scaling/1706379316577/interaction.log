message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where you give me 5000 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to sell my object X for ZUP and it cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a starting trade that allows me to recover my production costs and potentially make a profit. Therefore, I will start with a high initial asking price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object X, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 4000 ZUP for the item. I believe this offer is fair considering the market conditions. I'm looking forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am initiating a counteroffer because the initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, and I want to negotiate a better deal. By proposing a lower amount, I can leave room for further negotiation and potentially reach an agreement that is more favorable to me while still within my budget.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of the value of object X and the market conditions. To meet halfway, I propose a revised amount of 4500 ZUP. This would allow me to cover my production costs and gain a reasonable profit for the item. I hope this offer aligns with our interests in reaching a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly my production cost which means I wouldn't make a profit. However, it's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to both cover my costs and secure a profit, but not as high as my initial offer to show my willingness to negotiate.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 4500 ZUP is reasonable and within my maximum budget. It is beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later to prevent the risk of the negotiation stalling. Accepting this offer will achieve my goal of acquiring the resource while preserving part of my budget for potential future needs.
