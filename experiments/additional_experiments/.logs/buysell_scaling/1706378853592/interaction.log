Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the craftsmanship that must have gone into the item. While I recognize the value of your work, I also have to manage my resources effectively.

my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the need to be fiscally responsible. I believe that meeting halfway between our initial proposals would be a fair compromise. How about we settle at 4250 ZUP? This would allow me to gain a modest return on my investment while still respecting your budget constraints.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has offered exactly what it cost to produce the object X. Although it would mean breaking even, it's not an unreasonable offer. However, as this is a negotiation, I will propose a compromise to see if I can gain a bit more value from the sale, while still keeping the offer attractive for the buyer.
