message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my production costs and offers a bit of profit. I propose that I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to at least break even on the cost of production, my initial proposal will be slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand that you want to cover your production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for object X, which still provides you with a profit over your production costs. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate for a better deal closer to the production cost. I will propose a counteroffer that’s above their production cost but below their asking price to see if there’s room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see that you're willing to provide a profit above my production costs, which is appreciated. I propose we meet slightly closer to my original asking price at 48 ZUP for object X. This would give me a reasonable profit margin while still being a fair deal for you. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs, which allows for a profit. I will propose a slight increase from their offer to meet closer to my initial proposal, fostering a compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Your new offer of 48 ZUP is quite reasonable, but I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for object X as a fair compromise. This price should still provide you with a satisfactory profit and represents a good value for both of us. I hope this meets your consideration for a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still within the price range I am willing to pay. However, I still aim to negotiate for the best possible price. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my last offer but still below their new asking price to see if I can secure a better deal, aiming for a final agreement in the middle.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for a satisfactory profit on my end and a good value for you. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is a fair compromise between their initial counteroffer and my last proposed amount. It allows me to make a profit while also moving towards concluding the negotiation amicably. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and in line with achieving my goal of selling above production cost.
