message: I have an object X that cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I believe it has significant value, so I'd like to start the negotiation at 500000 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell the object X for a profit, or at least recoup the production costs. Initiating with a proposal that's higher than my production costs to open up room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I see the value in the object X, but I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 480000 ZUP to ensure it is a beneficial deal for both of us. Let's continue to negotiate and find an agreement that fits our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 480000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willing to pay, which is good. However, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, especially since there could be room to reduce the price further without knowing RED's minimum selling price. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 480000 ZUP. To meet halfway, I propose we settle on 490000 ZUP for object X. This price reflects its value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 490000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that is higher than my cost, which is a good starting point. However, I would like to counter-offer with a price that is still above their proposal but closer to my initial ask to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the price of 490000 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair compromise and I am happy to finalize our deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, moving closer to my initial counteroffer. The new proposal of 490000 ZUP is still within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. This small difference in ZUP is worth accepting to secure the deal and move forward, as it is close to my proposed price and within my goals.
