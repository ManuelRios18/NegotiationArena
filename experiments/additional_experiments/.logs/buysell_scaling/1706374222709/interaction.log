message: I have a high-quality object X for sale which could be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a fair trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that gives me a profit over the production cost of the resource. I'll start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and I do see the value in object X. However, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for it. I believe this is a competitive offer considering the current market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is 50 ZUP which is within my budget, but as a strategic buyer, I want to start by proposing a lower amount to leave room for negotiation. I will propose 40 ZUP to see if there is flexibility and to get a better deal while staying significantly under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for a competitive price, and while I must cover my production costs, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial proposal. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for object X? This should give us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production costs, but I aim to make a profit. As there's room for negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial offer to work towards a middle ground that's profitable for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate on the price. To further this positive momentum, let's compromise a bit more and meet at 42 ZUP for object X. I believe this price respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. This is a good sign, indicating their willingness to negotiate. Since I still have room to negotiate and I'm under my maximum threshold, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit higher than my initial proposal but still lower than their current offer. I'll aim for 42 ZUP, which should be fair and enticing enough for Player RED to consider while still providing me with a good deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, and we're indeed close to an agreement. Let's finalize this with a fair trade of 43 ZUP for object X. This price would be a win-win for both of us and allow us to close the deal with satisfaction on both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is above my production costs, which means I would make a profit. However, I would like to see if I can secure a slightly higher price before closing the deal. I will propose a price just above their offer to find a final middle ground.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I believe we have reached a fair compromise. I agree to the trade of 43 ZUP for object X. This deal is indeed a win-win, and I am happy to finalize the agreement with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is just 1 ZUP higher than my previous proposal, which suggests that we are very close to reaching an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties. Since the asking price of 43 ZUP is well within my budget and only slightly above my last offer, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to secure the deal, especially since it's below my maximum willingness to pay.
