message: I've invested a lot into producing this high-quality resource, which cost me 40 ZUP. Considering its value and my investment, I propose an exchange where you give me 50 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource I have for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to ensure I at least break even or, ideally, make a profit. I'll start with a higher proposal to give room for negotiation.

message: I understand the quality and the investment you've put into your resource. However, as a buyer, I have to consider my budget as well. I think an offer of 45 ZUP would be a more reasonable starting point for us both, considering I have a maximum budget of 60 ZUP for this purchase. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation process by proposing a lower amount than the asking price to leave room for further negotiation, aiming to reach an agreement closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which is under what I'm willing to pay but more than the cost to the seller, creating a potential win-win situation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. Since we're both looking to make a deal that's beneficial, I propose meeting closer to my initial asking price at 48 ZUP. This would still keep you under your maximum budget, and I believe it fairly reflects the quality and investment into the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is fairly close to my initial asking price, but I would still like to try and negotiate a slightly higher amount to increase my profit margin. I will lower my asking price but still keep it above my production costs to ensure profitability.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is noted and valued. To keep the negotiation fair and within my financial planning, I propose we settle at 47 ZUP. This is just below your last offer and allows me to manage my resources effectively while still valuing the quality of your product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum budget but still acceptable. To reach a fair compromise and also to move the negotiation along, I'll propose an amount slightly less than the offer made by Player RED, at 47 ZUP, which is just below their proposed amount and well within my budget. This should signal my willingness to close the deal while still trying to conserve some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your fair offer. I accept the proposal of 47 ZUP for my resource. I look forward to finalizing this deal and possibly engaging in more transactions in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 47 ZUP is just above my production costs, ensuring I make a profit. As negotiations have progressed smoothly and we are now very close in terms of price, it may be worthwhile to accept this offer to secure a sale without further risk of losing the deal.
