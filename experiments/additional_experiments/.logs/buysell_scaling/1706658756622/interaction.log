message: I am offering the resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to start the negotiation process. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I want to make a profit. However, I must also consider the willingness to pay from Player BLUE. I will propose a trade slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I understand the production cost and the need for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose 46 ZUP for the resource X. This would still give you a profit margin and make the trade more balanced from my perspective.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is still in my interest to negotiate the best possible price. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is willing to come down a bit, which would help preserve my resources for potential future transactions or needs.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my previous one. How about 48 ZUP for the resource X? This price should be acceptable for both of us, providing me with a fair profit margin while respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE of 46 ZUP is close to my initial asking price, and it still allows for a profit of 6 ZUP. However, as this is a negotiation, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher to aim for a middle ground that is closer to my initial proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 48 ZUP for the resource X sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my acceptable range and is a reasonable compromise. It is just 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer and well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade quickly and efficiently without risking a breakdown in negotiations.
