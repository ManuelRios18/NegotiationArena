message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for it. This price includes a slight margin above my costs. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to make sure I at least break even on my costs of production. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade that asks for slightly more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the need for a margin, but I would like to propose 42 ZUP for your resource X. It's a fair price that acknowledges the cost of your production while also considering the market dynamics. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay but starting with a counteroffer slightly lower than the asking price leaves room for negotiation, aiming to reach an agreement that is closer to the middle ground between the seller's cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer of 42 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to acknowledge the production costs. I believe we can agree on a slightly better price that benefits us both. How about we meet in the middle at 43 ZUP for my resource X? I think this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a price between their offer and my initial proposal.

message: Thank you for the quick response and willingness to negotiate. I find the compromise of 43 ZUP to be fair and reasonable. Let's finalize the deal at this price. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 43 ZUP is only slightly above my initial counteroffer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and on favorable terms, without using additional proposals or risking the deal escalating closer to my maximum limit.
