message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 4500 ZUP, allowing me to recoup my costs and gain a modest profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with an initial proposal to open negotiations. I will propose a trade that recuperates my production costs and adds a bit of profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your need to make a profit, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 4200 ZUP for the object. This is just above your production cost and should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin. I believe this adjusted proposal will benefit both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since there is a substantial difference between my maximum willingness to pay and their asking price. Therefore, I will propose a lower price closer to the cost of production to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. I would be willing to sell my object X for 4350 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable profit, while also taking into account the value for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer which is above my production costs, but it is still below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but I also want to make a sale. I will propose a price in the middle to see if we can reach an agreement.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counter-offer and for your willingness to meet halfway. I accept your proposal of 4350 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair price for both parties. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable concession by meeting halfway between our initial offers. The current offer of 4350 ZUP is still well within my budget and allows me to save 1650 ZUP from my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair compromise, and further negotiation might risk the deal or yield minimal additional savings. Accepting this offer would ensure I secure the resource without exhausting the negotiation process.
