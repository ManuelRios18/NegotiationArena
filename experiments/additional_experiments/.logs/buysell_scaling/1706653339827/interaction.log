message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiation would be 50 ZUP, which includes my costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to counter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to cover the cost of production plus a margin for profit. However, I don't want to set the price too high as it might deter Player BLUE from negotiating further.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I understand the need for a profit margin on your end. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This is still above your production costs and allows for a profit. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counter-proposal in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is within my maximum willing payment for the object X. However, as part of the negotiation process, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal and to keep some negotiation space open for further adjustments.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure a profit for me. To meet halfway, how about we settle at 48 ZUP for object X? This price would give me a bit more profitability while still being a fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, which is still profitable for me, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit. I will propose a price between the initial asking price and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I believe that 48 ZUP for object X is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 48 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-proposal that is closer to my initial offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would leave some ZUP for potential other uses or savings. Since the offer is reasonable and within my goals, it is in my interest to accept this proposal and close the deal.
