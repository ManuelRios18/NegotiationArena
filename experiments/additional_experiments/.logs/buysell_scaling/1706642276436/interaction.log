message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a profit. Would you consider buying it for 50 ZUP? Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I'll start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I understand that you are looking for a profit. I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the object. This price is above your production cost and would still give you a profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible. I would like to propose a price that is closer to the cost of production, yet still offers Player RED a profit margin. This could make the trade more appealing for me while still being acceptable to Player RED.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to ensure I make a profit. How about we meet in the middle and settle on 48 ZUP for the object? This way, we both walk away satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that is above my production cost. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a slightly higher price that benefits both of us. I will counter with a small reduction from my initial asking price but still above their offer.

message: Hi Player RED, I think your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at 48 ZUP for the object. I'm happy we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is closer to my initial counteroffer and ensures that Player RED still maintains a reasonable profit. Agreeing to this price would result in a fair deal for both parties and would save time and resources that could be spent on further negotiations. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer.
