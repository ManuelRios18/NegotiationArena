message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to sell it for a reasonable profit. Would you consider buying it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. I have to start at a higher price as it gives room for negotiation while aiming to achieve at least my break-even point.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand that you're looking for a fair profit. I'm interested in the object X, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP to start our negotiation. Looking forward to finding a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the seller has mentioned a production cost of 40 ZUP and is seeking a reasonable profit, offering 50 ZUP seems fair. However, as a buyer, I want to negotiate for the best possible price. Proposing a slightly lower amount could leave room for negotiation and potentially result in a better deal for me, given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to their cost to start the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see your interest in object X. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal, so how about we meet in the middle? I propose a price of 48 ZUP. I believe this reflects the value of the object and allows for a reasonable profit on my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is slightly above my production cost, but I would like to aim for a higher profit margin. I'll propose a compromise that still gives me a fair profit while coming down from my initial asking price. This should show my willingness to negotiate and come to a mutual agreement.

message: Thanks for the negotiation, Player RED. I believe your proposal of 48 ZUP is fair and reflects the value of the object while accounting for your costs and desired profit. I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is only 3 ZUP higher than my initial counteroffer and is quite reasonable considering it's still below the starting price they suggested. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object while staying well within my budget.
