Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource that I'm sure will benefit you. Considering the cost of production and the value it offers, I propose a fair trade of 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the initial proposal, I want to set a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I'll start by setting a high price expecting negotiation from Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your resource and am eager to acquire it. However, given my budget constraints and to make sure I have enough ZUP for potential future transactions, I'd like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP. I believe this offer still reflects the value of your resource and enables us to both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay for the resource; however, it's always good to negotiate to try to get a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget considerations and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, I've adjusted my price to 48 ZUP. This reflects both the quality of the resource and ensures that we can conclude this deal with mutual satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and covers my production costs, but I would still like to aim for a higher profit margin. I will make a slight concession to move the negotiation forward while still aiming for a price above my cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your adjustment is fair, and I'm pleased to meet you halfway. I accept the offer of 48 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal and look forward to more in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is close to their initial proposal and still within my maximum willingness to pay. I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through and to preserve a good relationship for any future transactions. The price is reasonable, and there is little benefit in prolonging negotiations for a small additional discount.
