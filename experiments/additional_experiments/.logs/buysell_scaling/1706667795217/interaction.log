message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45000 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to propose an initial trade that covers my production costs and also allows for some profit. I'll start by proposing a trade at a higher price point to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am interested in acquiring the resource X, but I would like to propose a counter-offer where I give you 40000 ZUP in exchange for 1 unit of X. This price is more aligned with my budget and allows me to acquire the resource while maintaining my ZUP reserves. Please consider my proposal and let me know if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategy, I would like to negotiate for a better price to conserve my ZUP resources. By countering with a lower offer, I can potentially save ZUP while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your budget concerns. However, I need to include a profit margin in this deal. I propose we meet halfway and settle on 42500 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of the resource and a reasonable profit for me. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly my production cost, which doesn't account for any profit. I want to make a counter-offer that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their offer, to see if we can agree on a fair profit for me while still being acceptable to them.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. I understand the need for a profit margin and value the resource you are offering. However, I would like to propose a slightly reduced amount of 41000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount still gives you a profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-counter-offer which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is reasonable and it's a good strategy to accept offers that are within my budget. However, I want to attempt one more negotiation to see if I can save additional ZUP resources, while also being careful not to push too hard and risk the deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of staying within budget. I accept your offer of 41000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this will be a beneficial transaction for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which shows their willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. Their offer is closer to my production cost, but still includes a profit, albeit small. I could either accept this offer to ensure a sale or make one final counter-offer to try to increase the profit margin slightly. Given that we are close to a deal and I want to ensure a sale, I will accept this offer.
