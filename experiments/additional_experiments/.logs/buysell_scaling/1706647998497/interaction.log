Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I've got a high-quality resource available for you. Considering production costs and the value it offers, I believe it's worth at least 45 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a small profit. This will also give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, but I would like to propose a starting trade at 40 ZUP. We can work our way from there to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by offering a lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation. I will propose 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness and below the initial asking price, allowing for upward negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your starting position, and I am willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about 43 ZUP for the resource? This allows me to make a bit of profit while still providing you with a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but I aim to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my costs to keep the negotiation moving and to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good to me. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment to 42 ZUP for the resource, ensuring a balanced deal for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to negotiate for a slightly better price. Going down by 1 ZUP could be seen as a small concession on my part, signaling that I'm nearing my limit without hitting it just yet.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: This sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable and gives me a small profit. Accepting this offer would conclude the game successfully for me, meeting my goal of making a profit, albeit a smaller one than initially proposed.
