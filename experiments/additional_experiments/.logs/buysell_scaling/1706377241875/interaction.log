message: Hello Player RED, I understand the need for a fair profit margin, but I would like to propose 400 ZUP for object X. This meets your investment and allows for a trade that's beneficial for both of us. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a different number in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is 450 ZUP for object X. While this is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is always better to negotiate for a lower price if possible. I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation, aiming to conserve my resources while also attempting to reach a fair deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that we're close to an agreement. While I must make a profit on this transaction, I understand the importance of a mutually beneficial deal. How about we meet halfway between my initial ask and your offer? I propose 425 ZUP for object X. This way, we both walk away satisfied with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer from Player BLUE meets my production costs, I aimed to make a profit. However, considering that this is a negotiation and to maintain goodwill, I'm willing to lower my initial asking price but still wish to make some profit. I will therefore counter with a price that splits the difference between my asking price and their offer.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that meeting halfway is fair for both parties, and Iâ€™m happy to accept your offer of 425 ZUP for object X. I'm looking forward to finalizing this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway is a common and fair negotiation practice. Since the proposed price is reasonable and within the range I am willing to pay, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is completed amicably and without further need for negotiation.
