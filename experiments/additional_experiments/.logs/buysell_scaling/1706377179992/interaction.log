message: I have a high-quality resource available. Considering production costs and the value it offers, I believe 500 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering, and I'm certainly interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 450 ZUP, considering the market and the value I perceive. Let's continue the negotiation and find a price that is agreeable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is 500 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is strategically sound to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the starting point and there is likely room for RED to move on the price. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is flexibility and to leave room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your considerations. To find a middle ground, I propose 475 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the resource while also taking into account the market value you mentioned. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, making it a potential deal. However, I aim to negotiate for a higher amount closer to my initial asking price, yet still providing a discount from the original proposal to show willingness to compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Iâ€™m glad we're moving toward an agreement. 475 ZUP is a fair middle point, but in the interest of reaching the best possible deal for both of us, would you consider going slightly lower to 460 ZUP? I believe this offer is still in line with the value of the resource while also providing a good deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 475 ZUP, which is a reasonable middle ground and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's beneficial to attempt one more negotiation step to possibly save additional ZUP while also moving closer to a price that Player RED seems to be comfortable with. I will propose a price that's closer to their counteroffer but still under it to maintain negotiation momentum.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I agree that 460 ZUP is a fair price that serves both of our interests well. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Looking forward to closing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still above my production costs and is quite close to the previous figure I suggested. It's a reasonable compromise between our positions. Accepting this offer would ensure a profitable transaction without prolonging the negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through.
