message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object, ensuring that I cover my costs and make a profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the game has just started and I need to sell my resources for ZUP, I will start the negotiation with a proposal that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. This initial proposal is also a starting point for the negotiation and can be adjusted based on Player BLUE's response.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping we could negotiate a bit more on the price. My counteroffer is 45 ZUP for the object. This price should still give you a decent profit margin above your production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move to negotiate, I will propose a lower price to see if there is room for negotiation and possibly arrive at a more favorable price for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a better deal. While I initially asked for 50 ZUP, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about 48 ZUP for the object? This price should still be reasonable for both of us, considering the production costs and the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs, which is a good starting point. However, I aimed for a higher profit margin. I believe a compromise can be reached that's beneficial for both parties. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above Player BLUE's offer to maintain a decent profit margin.

message: Thank you for considering my offer and your willingness to meet halfway. I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the value of the object and a good deal for both parties. Would you agree to this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I would like to push for a slightly better deal without risking the negotiation falling through. I will propose a price closer to my initial counteroffer but still higher to show willingness to compromise.

message: I appreciate your negotiation and willingness to find a fair middle ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a second counteroffer, which is closer to my initial asking price. The offer of 46 ZUP gives me a profit that is above my production costs. Given that negotiations should lead to a mutually acceptable agreement and we are nearing a fair middle ground, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of not selling at all.
