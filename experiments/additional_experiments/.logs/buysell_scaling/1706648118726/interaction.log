message: I have an object X available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a profit, so I'm proposing a price of 50 ZUP for it. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and make a profit. The initial proposal will be slightly higher than my costs to give room for negotiation.

message: I'm interested in the object X, but I was hoping we could come to an agreement on a slightly lower price. Considering the production cost and the need for a profit, would you accept 45 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
My goal is to acquire the resource for at most 60 ZUP, but the initial offer by Player RED is 50 ZUP. I want to negotiate a better deal closer to my ideal price but also leave room for further negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer that is below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the cost of production for Player RED to ensure that they are still making a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for object X? This would still give me a slight profit while also giving you a fair price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but lower than my initial asking price. I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a slightly higher price that would be acceptable for both parties, considering the need for profit. I will counter with a price that splits the difference, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit.

message: Meeting in the middle sounds good to me, but I was thinking of something slightly lower. Would you consider 46 ZUP for object X? It seems like a fair compromise that gives you a profit while also being reasonable for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range but still above the midpoint between my initial counteroffer and their original price. I believe there is still room for negotiation to get a better deal, closer to my target price. I will make a second proposal that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still below the 48 ZUP in hopes of reaching a final agreement that is more favorable for me.

message: Thank you for your offer. I accept the 46 ZUP for object X. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a proposal of 46 ZUP, which is a step closer to my last proposal. This offer still provides me with a profit and seems to be close to the maximum that Player BLUE is willing to spend. Considering this is my third proposal, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful sale and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether.
