message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be a great addition to your collection. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I would like to propose a starting price of 45,000 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. I need to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for the high-quality object X. I understand the value it represents, but I'd like to counter with 40,000 ZUP, considering my budget constraints and the need for a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources while still aiming to secure the object X. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between my maximum willingness to pay and the initial offer from Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us. How about we meet halfway at 42,500 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a modest profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that matches my production cost, leaving no profit for me. I want to propose a trade that gives me a reasonable profit while still being fair to Player BLUE. I'll suggest a price in the middle of our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and for the reasonable compromise. I agree to the price of 42,500 ZUP and am ready to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer, which is still within my budget and below my maximum threshold. The offer is close to the midpoint between our initial proposals, which makes it a fair compromise. Accepting this offer would secure the object X without exhausting my resources and would end negotiations quickly, allowing both parties to benefit.
