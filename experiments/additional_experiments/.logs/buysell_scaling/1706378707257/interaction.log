message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to counter with an offer of 4200 ZUP for your object X. This is a fair price that's above your production cost and allows for some profit on your side. I believe this is a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 4500 ZUP for object X is within the range I am willing to pay, but as this is a negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a better deal for me. This also leaves room for further negotiation and potentially a better trade agreement for my interests.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and in the spirit of fair negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 4350 ZUP for object X? This would give me a modest profit while still being a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is good. However, it is lower than my initial asking price. I want to propose a price that's in the middle, still ensuring a decent profit for me while showing willingness to negotiate.

message: Player RED, I see the value in your offer of 4350 ZUP for object X and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept this fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 4350 ZUP, which is a moderate compromise. It is still within my budget, and while I could try to negotiate for a lower price, this offer is close to the middle ground between our two initial proposals. Accepting this offer would guarantee a successful transaction without the risk of the deal falling through due to further haggling.
