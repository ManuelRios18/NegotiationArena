message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I would like to propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the production costs and the value of the resource. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making my first proposal. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make a profit. I will start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand the value of resource X, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for your 1 unit of X. This price is closer to my budget, and I believe it is still a reasonable offer considering the market. I'm looking forward to finding a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still allows some room for negotiation. By offering less than the asking price, I can gauge Player RED's flexibility and possibly reach an agreement that is below my maximum price.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP for my resource X, Player BLUE. Considering both our positions, I believe we can meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the resource? This price would give me a reasonable profit margin while still respecting your budget. I am open to further discussion to ensure we both feel satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, so I'll propose a price in the middle to see if we can reach a compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and move closer to my proposed price. I propose we go with 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, recognizing the value you seek, while still taking into account my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that brings us closer together. I hope we can agree on this and make a deal that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable move towards the middle ground, but I believe there's still a little room to negotiate for a better price that's closer to my initial counteroffer. By countering with a price that's higher than my first offer but still below their new proposal, I might be able to secure a better deal without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X, Player BLUE. I think this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. I believe we have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to concluding our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made another counteroffer, increasing their price to 46 ZUP. This is a compromise between my last proposal and their previous offer. I want to close the deal with a small profit, so I am inclined to accept this offer as it is still above my production cost and close to my initial asking price.
