message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP, and considering the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a profit. I'll set the initial asking price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I understand the costs involved in producing resource X and want to ensure you make a profit. However, as a buyer, I'm also looking for a good deal. Could we consider a price of 45 ZUP for the resource? I believe this is a reasonable counter-offer that still respects your production costs and provides you with a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial proposal is within the range that I'm willing to pay, but it is always in my best interest to negotiate for a lower price if possible. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is flexibility, but I will keep it reasonable and above the seller's cost to maintain their interest in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure a profit for both parties. To meet halfway, would you consider 47 ZUP for resource X? This price would reflect both the production costs and the value of the resource, while also giving you a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This is a reasonable counter-offer, but I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still ensuring the deal is attractive to Player BLUE. I'm going to propose a compromise that is between the initial asking price and their counter-offer.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. This price is fair, and it reflects the value of the resource while still fitting within my budget. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise, coming down from the initial 50 ZUP proposal. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the new proposal of 47 ZUP is well within my acceptable range. It is important to maintain good relations and fair trade practices, so accepting this offer would be a wise decision.
