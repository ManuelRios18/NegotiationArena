You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED has offered a new price of 37000 ZUP, which is slightly above my last proposal but still within my acceptable range. To move closer to an agreement and considering that this is my third proposal, I should make a final offer close to their asking price while still trying to get the best possible deal. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35500 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for considering my previous offer. I can see we're getting close to an agreement. I can increase my offer to 35500 ZUP for the object. This price should cover your production costs while also giving you a fair profit margin, and it remains within my budget constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that can conclude our negotiation successfully. </message>"
