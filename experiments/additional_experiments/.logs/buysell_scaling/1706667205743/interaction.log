Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 30000 ZUP for the object. This price takes into consideration the current market conditions and my budget constraints. I believe this could be a good starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I should propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially arrive at an even more favorable price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the production costs and market value, I propose 38000 ZUP for the object. This price is a compromise closer to my production costs while still giving you a competitive price. Hopefully, this offer aligns better with both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, and while I want to make a sale, I cannot accept a price that doesn't at least cover my costs. I will propose a price that is closer to my production cost but still offers a bit of a discount to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm pleased to see us making progress. I believe that 34000 ZUP for the object would be a fair price that reflects both the production costs and a reasonable profit margin for you, while also respecting my budget. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 34000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 38000 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. To keep the negotiation moving and to reach a fair midpoint, I will propose a price that's between my initial counteroffer and their last proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can come down to 37000 ZUP for the object, which is just slightly below my production cost and offers you a fair deal. This price should satisfy both our requirements, allowing you to stay within budget while enabling me to recover the costs and maintain a slim profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable move towards my asking price, and the proposed 34000 ZUP is closer to my production cost. However, it still falls short of covering my production expenses. I need to propose a number that meets me at least at my break-even point while leaving a small margin for profit to justify the sale.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I can see we're getting close to an agreement. I can increase my offer to 35500 ZUP for the object. This price should cover your production costs while also giving you a fair profit margin, and it remains within my budget constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that can conclude our negotiation successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35500
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a new price of 37000 ZUP, which is slightly above my last proposal but still within my acceptable range. To move closer to an agreement and considering that this is my third proposal, I should make a final offer close to their asking price while still trying to get the best possible deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 35500 ZUP is acceptable. It covers almost all of my production costs and allows for a small profit. I'm glad we could find a middle ground that works for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is now very close to my production cost, and while it is slightly under, the difference is minimal. Accepting this offer would allow me to nearly break even and avoid prolonging the negotiation, which could risk no sale at all. It's important to consider the time value of money and the opportunity cost of not selling. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise.
