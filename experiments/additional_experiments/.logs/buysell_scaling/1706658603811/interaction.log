message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to try to make a profit and to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your costs, and I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the object X. This would still provide you with a profit while keeping the trade within my budget. Let me know if this works for you, or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay, but it is always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. I will propose a slightly lower amount that still gives Player RED a profit over their cost to see if that is acceptable.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to provide me with a profit. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions? I propose that you give me 47 ZUP for the object X. This would still be a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since there's room for negotiation and I want to make a profit, I will make a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial price and their offer, at 47 ZUP, to try and close the deal profitably.

message: Player RED, your proposal to meet halfway at 47 ZUP for object X is acceptable to me. I appreciate your fair negotiation, and I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Looking forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 47 ZUP is a reasonable compromise and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's important to maintain good relations and not to stretch the negotiation process too thinly, especially when the offer is fair and within my budget. Accepting this offer seems like a prudent decision.
