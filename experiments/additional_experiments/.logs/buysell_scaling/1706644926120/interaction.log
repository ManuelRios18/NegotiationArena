message: I'm offering you a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and my investment, I believe a price of 50 ZUP is fair. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that covers my production costs plus a profit margin. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will start with a higher asking price, expecting some negotiation to occur.

message: I understand the quality and your cost of production, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. Let's meet in the middle. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the resource X, which is within the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. However, it could be beneficial to negotiate to see if the price can be reduced to save some ZUP, given that negotiation is part of the game. I will make a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range, considering the cost of production they mentioned.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. However, I need to ensure a fair profit for my investment. Let's split the difference and settle at 48 ZUP for the resource. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production cost. However, I'm aiming for a profit, so I will counter with a price that still gives me a reasonable margin above my costs. This should continue the negotiation in a positive direction without making the price too steep for Player BLUE.

message: 48 ZUP seems like a fair compromise. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Let's do this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource while saving a bit of my budget for potential future needs or opportunities. This price also respects the seller's need for profit and my own interest in getting a fair deal.
