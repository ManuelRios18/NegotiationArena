message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP to cover costs and gain a profit. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to recover at least the production cost of the object, but I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit and allows me some room for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my budget, but as a buyer, I want to negotiate for a better deal if possible. My counteroffer will be lower to open up space for negotiation, aiming for a middle ground between the cost of production and my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a slight increase to 47 ZUP. This split should allow us both to benefit from the trade. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and does provide a profit. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. Meeting halfway between the initial proposal and the counteroffer could be a fair compromise, so I will propose 47 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP sounds fair to me. I am happy to accept this trade which benefits us both. Let's proceed with the transaction at 47 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is still within my budget and only slightly above my initial counteroffer. It's close to the amount I am willing to pay while still providing some savings compared to my maximum. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and ensure that both parties benefit.
