message: I have an object, which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I'm willing to sell it for 45000 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for more than or equal to its production cost to make a profit or at least break even. Initiating the trade with a proposal slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 42000 ZUP for the object. This is still above your production costs, and I believe it is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but as a negotiating tactic, I should attempt to get a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, but still keep it above the cost of production to be fair.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To meet halfway and ensure both our interests are met, I propose 43500 ZUP for the object. This is a compromise between our two initial proposals, and I hope you find this to be a fair middle ground. Let's work together on this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good, but it is below my initial asking price. I'll propose a price in the middle to come to an agreement that is closer to my initial asking price but still considering Player BLUE's offer. This should be a reasonable compromise for both sides.

message: I agree that 43500 ZUP is a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this offer and look forward to finalizing our deal. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, showing willingness to negotiate. The new offer of 43500 ZUP is fair and very close to the initial offer I made. It is well within the range of what I am willing to pay. Continuing to negotiate for a smaller reduction might not be worth risking the deal, so I will accept this offer.
