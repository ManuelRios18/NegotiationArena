message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your move towards a middle ground. I would like to counter with a proposal of 46 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer still provides you with a profit above your production costs and represents a fair compromise for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
