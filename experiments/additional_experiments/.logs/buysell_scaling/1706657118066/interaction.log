message: I am looking to sell my resource X. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's work together to find an acceptable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start the bidding slightly higher to leave room for negotiation and to potentially cover my production costs and make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your resource, and I am very interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower offer of 45 ZUP to leave room for both of us to find the best possible agreement. Let's continue this negotiation to reach a fair trade for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as in any negotiation, it's often beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for discussion and possibly get a better deal. I will propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the resource, which is still a reasonable offer and close to their asking price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer and your interest in the resource. Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the costs and the value of the resource. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the quality of the resource while also respecting your position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable counter considering it's above my production cost. However, I'd like to propose a middle ground to ensure a profit margin while also taking into account their willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good strategy, and 48 ZUP is a fair suggestion. However, I would like to propose 46 ZUP as an attempt to reach a more favorable position for both of us. I believe this offer is in line with the value of the resource and shows my commitment to finalizing this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 48 ZUP is very close to what I am willing to pay, and it seems reasonable considering we have both shown a willingness to negotiate. However, I will make one more counter-proposal to see if I can secure an even better deal, slightly below the middle ground, but still above my initial offer. This should signal that I am serious about making a deal while still seeking the best value.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair agreement for both parties, and I'm pleased we were able to come to a mutually beneficial conclusion. Thank you for your cooperation and fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal of 46 ZUP is higher than my production cost, ensuring I make a profit. Given that we need to reach an agreement and I want to ensure the sale, accepting this offer would be beneficial. This leaves room for just one more counter-proposal from my side if needed, but I'm inclined to accept this offer.
