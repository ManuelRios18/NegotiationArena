message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource, which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm asking for 45000 ZUP in exchange. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the objective is to sell my resource for ZUP and I want to cover my costs at the very least, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter with 38000 ZUP for the resource. It's still above your production cost and gives us some space to find a common ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower amount than what Player RED is asking for but still within a range that shows I am interested in purchasing the resource. This will leave room for further negotiation and potentially reaching an agreement that is closer to my maximum willing price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand the need for negotiation, but selling at 38000 ZUP would incur a loss for me. I propose a fair middle ground of 42000 ZUP, which covers my production costs and gives us both a fair deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. Therefore, I need to counter with an amount that at least covers my costs and gives me a profit margin. However, I want to keep the negotiation friendly and show willingness to meet in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and the need to cover production costs. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 40000 ZUP. This should give you a reasonable profit margin while staying within my budget. Do you think we could settle on this amount?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still above it. I want to negotiate further to bring the price down more towards my target purchase price without offending the seller or ending the negotiations prematurely.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your consideration and understanding of my costs. I accept your offer of 40000 ZUP for the resource. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost. Although this would not give me a profit, it would allow me to recover my investment. Given that the negotiation could go on with counteroffers that risk going below my cost, it might be prudent to consider accepting this offer to ensure I break even, especially since further negotiation could sour the deal or lead to a loss.
