newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that will allow me to recover my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value of your product. However, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints, I propose a counteroffer of 350000 ZUP for the object. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially reach a more favorable outcome for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but the proposed price doesn't cover my production costs. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I propose 400000 ZUP for the object. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is below my production costs. I need to propose a price that is above my costs but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. By meeting halfway between the initial offer and the counteroffer, I'm showing willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a reasonable approach, and I value the effort to reach a fair compromise. I propose a slight increase from my last offer to 375000 ZUP. This price should help cover your costs while also respecting my budget. I believe this is a good balance for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 375000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 400000 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, but it could be beneficial to negotiate slightly further to see if I can secure the object for a lower price. However, I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the deal. A small concession from my end may lead to an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your consideration and the new offer. I propose a final adjustment to 390000 ZUP. This is a small concession from my end and just below my asking price, but it should be manageable within your budget. I hope this final offer aligns with our mutual interests and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 390000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below my production costs. However, to facilitate a sale and considering that arriving at an exact recovery may be challenging, I might need to accept a slight loss. I will make a final proposal that's slightly above my costs, indicating my final concession.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession. Your final offer of 390000 ZUP is acceptable and aligns with my budget. Let's proceed with the deal at this price and close the negotiation. Thank you for a constructive and fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is quite close to the price that I am willing to pay. It is within the range of my budget, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer would ensure that I secure the object without exhausting the negotiation process and risking the deal.
