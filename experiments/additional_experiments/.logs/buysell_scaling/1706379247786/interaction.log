message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my resource X in exchange for 5000 ZUP. This resource is of high quality and has cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer if necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade to start the negotiation process. I aim to at least recover the production cost of the resource, but I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the resource X you're offering. However, considering the market and my budget, I would like to counterpropose with an offer of 4500 ZUP for your resource. This should still provide you with a reasonable profit margin, and it would be more aligned with my purchasing strategy. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve ZUP for any future transactions or needs. Hence, I'm going to propose a lower price that is still within a reasonable range and allows room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I propose 4750 ZUP for the resource X. This price will provide me with a fair profit and should still be within your purchasing strategy. Let me know your thoughts.

message: I see your point, Player RED, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. I propose we go a little lower to 4600 ZUP for resource X. I think this strikes a fair balance, giving you a solid profit while also respecting my resource management strategy. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4600
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to the midpoint between our initial proposals. This new offer is still within my budget and allows me to conserve ZUP for other potential uses. However, I believe there might still be a small margin to negotiate for a slightly better price without risking the deal.

message: Thank you for your understanding and your proposal, Player BLUE. I am pleased with our progress. Let's settle on 4700 ZUP for resource X. This price gives me a modest profit margin while still respecting your purchasing strategy. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4700
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is quite close to the previous one I made, and it still ensures a decent profit for me. It would be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a sale, but since I have one more proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I will try to reach for a slightly higher amount.

reason: Player RED's new proposal of 4700 ZUP is quite close to my last offer and is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource.

Since we are nearing a fair and mutually beneficial agreement, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
