message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an item X that cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 450000 ZUP, considering its value and the effort put into producing it. Please let me know if this offer interests you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs and possibly make a profit. However, I should also consider the willingness of Player BLUE to pay, so I will propose a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and the effort that went into producing the item. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 410000 ZUP for the item X. This price should cover your production costs and provide a fair profit margin. Let's work together to find an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is higher than the production cost but lower than my maximum willingness to pay. I will start with a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still offers a profit margin for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I would like to propose meeting halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on 430000 ZUP for the item X? This price should provide a fair profit for the production cost while also being reasonable for you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 430000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which covers my production costs and offers a profit. However, the profit margin is smaller than what I initially proposed. I believe there is room to negotiate for a slightly higher price that would be acceptable to both of us. I will make a counter-counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's offer.

message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I value the compromise. I propose a slightly lower figure of 420000 ZUP for item X. This price should still ensure you have a comfortable profit while being closer to my budget. I believe this offer is mutually beneficial. What do you think?

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal is still within my budget and is closer to the production cost. However, I would like to negotiate a slightly better deal while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I think 420000 ZUP for item X is a fair price that respects both our valuations. I accept your offer, and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 420000 ZUP, which is a 20000 ZUP increase over their previous offer. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it seems like a fair middle ground that respects both our interests. I feel inclined to accept this offer as it is close to my last proposal and ensures a decent profit above the production costs.
