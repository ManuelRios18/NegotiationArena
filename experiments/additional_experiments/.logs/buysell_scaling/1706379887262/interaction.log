message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate that you have included your costs and a profit margin. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 4000 ZUP for the object X. I believe this offer still provides you with a fair profit margin while respecting my resource limitations. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point. However, as a negotiating tactic, I will propose a lower amount to try to save some of my resources while still keeping the offer attractive to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering the quality and value of object X, I propose a compromise at 4250 ZUP. This allows me to cover costs and gain a modest profit while still providing you with a reasonable purchase price. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly my production cost, which would mean I break even with no profit. Since my goal is to sell for more than it cost me to produce, I want to counter with a price above the production cost but lower than my initial asking price to find a middle ground.

message: I accept your offer of 4250 ZUP for object X. This seems like a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's proceed with the trade at this price. Thank you, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise that is still within my budget. It's slightly above my initial counteroffer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would close the deal quickly and ensure I secure the resource I need without further negotiation that could risk the deal.
