Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, taking into account the production costs and a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade with a price slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the need for profit. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. It's slightly above your costs, ensuring you make a profit, while also keeping the price within a comfortable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that the seller's cost is 40 ZUP, and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I want to propose a price closer to the middle of these two amounts to leave room for negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement that is beneficial to both parties. I'm proposing 45 ZUP as it is above the cost of production and allows for profit, but still within a range that is acceptable for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. I propose we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. This would still ensure I cover my production costs and make a profit, while also respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that is above my production costs, but it's lower than my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price that meets halfway between my initial proposal and their offer, to keep the negotiation moving forward and still secure a decent profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I propose we settle on 46 ZUP. This is a compromise between our initial offers and ensures that you still make a profit while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground, slightly higher than my initial offer but still below the maximum I'm willing to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource while maintaining a good margin. However, I believe there's still a bit of room to negotiate a slightly better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 46 ZUP. It's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is a 6 ZUP profit for me. This is close to my target and seems like a fair compromise. I want to close the deal without prolonging the negotiation, as the offer is reasonable and ensures I make a profit.
