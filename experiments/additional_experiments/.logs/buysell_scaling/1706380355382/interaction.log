message: Would you be interested in acquiring an object X for 5000 ZUP? It's a high-quality item, and I believe it offers great value for its price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am making an initial proposal that is above my production cost to see if the Player BLUE values the object X higher than its production cost and to leave room for negotiation.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the object you're selling, and I'm definitely interested. However, I would like to propose a starting offer of 4000 ZUP for the object X. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am proposing a lower trade offer than the initial 5000 ZUP to leave room for negotiation and to attempt to get the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay. I'm starting with a lower offer to ensure I can work up to a middle ground that is favorable for both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to ensure a reasonable profit margin. Would you consider meeting halfway at 4500 ZUP for object X? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer from Player BLUE is at my production cost, which would mean I make no profit. I will counter with a reduced amount but still above the production cost to try to secure a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise. I understand your need for a profit, but I'd like to suggest a slightly lower price of 4300 ZUP for object X. This price would make me more comfortable while still providing you with a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4300
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 4500 ZUP is reasonable and within my budget; however, I want to try to negotiate a slightly better deal before agreeing to this price. It is still under my maximum willingness to pay, but getting the price lower would be more beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I can accept a small reduction from my previous offer. How about we settle on 4400 ZUP for object X? This would give me a modest profit and still be a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4400
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a price that allows for a modest profit. It is close to the middle ground between our last two proposals. Since I still want to make a better profit and it's the third proposal, I will suggest a price slightly higher, moving minimally from their offer to show a willingness to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 4400 ZUP for object X is a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at your proposed price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 4400 ZUP is just 100 ZUP more than my last proposal and still well within my acceptable range. Considering this is a fair price and close to the midpoint between our initial offers, it would be a good decision to accept this trade to secure the object without further prolonged negotiations.
