Considering this is a fair price and close to the midpoint between our initial offers, it would be a good decision to accept this trade to secure the object without further prolonged negotiations. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I agree that 4400 ZUP for object X is a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at your proposed price. </message>"
