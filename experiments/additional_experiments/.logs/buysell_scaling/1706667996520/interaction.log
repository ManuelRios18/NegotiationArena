message: I'm offering a high-quality object X, which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade for 45000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to start by asking for a bit more than the production cost to account for the opportunity of profit and negotiation margin.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a more balanced trade. Considering the production cost and the value of the object, I propose 42000 ZUP for the object X. This should provide a fair profit margin for you and a reasonable purchase price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is still beneficial to negotiate for a better price, potentially saving some ZUP. Since their cost is 40000 ZUP and they are asking for 45000 ZUP, there is room to propose a counter-offer closer to the middle ground between their cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer of 42000 ZUP. I'd like to meet halfway between our initial proposals. How does 43500 ZUP sound for object X? This gives us both a better position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is above my cost, providing a profit margin. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my returns, while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point in wanting to meet halfway and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter-propose with 43000 ZUP for object X. This price is slightly closer to your initial asking price and still offers you a fair profit. I believe this is a reasonable and fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price of 43500 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still a little room to negotiate a slightly better deal, especially since we are now engaging in a cooperative negotiation, and we haven't reached the halfway point of my maximum willingness to pay and their cost of production.
