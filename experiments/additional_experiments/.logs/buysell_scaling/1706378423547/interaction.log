message: I have this quality object that cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose to sell it to you for 4500 ZUP, allowing me to cover my costs and gain a profit. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. Considering the production cost of 4000 ZUP, I want to propose a price that also allows room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose 4200 ZUP for the object. This still gives you a decent profit margin and makes the deal more attractive for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 4500 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's good practice to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a lower price to start the negotiation, but still within a range that should be acceptable to both parties, considering the production cost.

message: I appreciate your offer and the quick response. I understand the importance of finding a beneficial agreement for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at 4350 ZUP? This price gives me a reasonable profit while also respecting the value of the object for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it still provides a profit over the production cost. To negotiate, I'll propose a slightly higher amount that meets us closer to the middle, still ensuring a good profit for my resource.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a fair approach. How about we settle at 4250 ZUP? This price is a compromise between our initial proposals and allows for a fair profit on your side while maintaining a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 4350 ZUP, which is still within my budget. However, I believe there is still a bit of room to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount that is closer to my initial offer yet still gives Player RED a profit over their production cost.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 4250 ZUP is a fair compromise. It offers me a decent profit and ensures you get the object at a good value. Let's finalize this deal at 4250 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is slightly above their previous offer and still allows me to make a profit. It is a compromise that seems fair and reasonable. It's close to the middle ground we've been negotiating towards and accepting this offer would ensure a successful deal for both parties without further back-and-forth, which could risk the trade.
