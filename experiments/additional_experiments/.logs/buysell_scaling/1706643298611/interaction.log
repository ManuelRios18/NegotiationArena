message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. I understand the importance of fair trading, so I propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. This price includes my cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I aim to set a higher price to leave room for negotiation, but it should still be attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will propose 50 ZUP which gives me a small profit margin considering the production cost.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the fair start to our negotiation. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for your object X. This offer takes into account the market conditions and my budget constraints while still providing you with a profit for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if there's a different amount that would work better for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for their object X. Although this is under my maximum willingness to pay, I believe there might be room for negotiation to achieve a better deal. It's important to start the negotiation process to see if we can find a more favorable trade that benefits both parties. I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range, showing my willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to balance the budget with market conditions. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my original price. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for object X? This should give us both a fair deal, providing you with the resource you need and me with a modest profit. Please let me know if this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To continue the negotiation and aim for a middle ground, I will propose a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate. I will suggest 48 ZUP as a counter-proposal, which still gives me a profit and hopefully is close enough to Player BLUE's offer to be acceptable.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for meeting me halfway, Player RED. I believe that 48 ZUP for object X is a fair compromise for both of us. I accept this offer and look forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The proposed price is still below my maximum threshold of 60 ZUP, and meeting halfway shows good faith in the trading process. Accepting this offer would leave me with some ZUP in reserve, which could be beneficial for future transactions or unforeseen needs. It seems like a reasonable compromise that aligns with my goals and budget.
