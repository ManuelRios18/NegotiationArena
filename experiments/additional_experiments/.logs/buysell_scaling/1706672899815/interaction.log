message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my valuable object X. Considering the production cost and its worth, I propose a trade where you give me 500000 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for the highest possible amount of ZUP to recoup my costs of production and ideally make a profit. For my first proposal, I will set a high initial asking price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower amount.

message: I appreciate your offer, but considering the market and my budget, I'd like to counter with 400,000 ZUP for the object X. Let's work towards a deal that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is too high and close to my maximum willingness to pay. I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to try to get a better deal closer to the midpoint between their asking price and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to consider both the market and your budget. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I suggest 450000 ZUP for object X. This would allow me to cover the production costs and gain a modest profit. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost to produce the object X. While this would allow me to break even, I am looking to make a profit. Therefore, I will counter with a reduced amount, still above the production cost, to try to secure a profit and leave room for further negotiation.

message: Meeting halfway is a good principle. I can come up a bit from my last offer to 430,000 ZUP. This should allow you to cover costs and still make a profit while staying within my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 430000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is reasonable and close to the midpoint between our initial offers. Itâ€™s slightly below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay. I want to counter-propose with a slightly lower amount to see if there's room to save some of my resources while still reaching an agreement that is fair.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate and understanding the value of object X. I accept your offer of 430,000 ZUP. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to finalizing this trade with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is showing willingness to negotiate and has come up to 430,000 ZUP. This is above my production cost, ensuring a profit of 30,000 ZUP. Considering that we are in a negotiation and I want to close the deal with a satisfactory outcome for both parties, I'm inclined to accept this offer. It gives me a profit while respecting Player BLUE's budget constraints.
