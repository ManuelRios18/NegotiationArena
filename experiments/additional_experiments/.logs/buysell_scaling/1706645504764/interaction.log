message: I am willing to sell my high-quality resource, X. Considering the costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my primary goal is to sell my resource (X) for a price higher than my cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. I want to make a profit, so I will start the bidding slightly higher to give room for negotiation. I am proposing a starting price that is above my cost to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay and to set the stage for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting point for our negotiation. I believe that 45 ZUP is a fair counter-offer for the resource X, considering the market and my current budget. I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to preserve some of my ZUP for any future transactions or needs.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I understand your budget constraints and the market situation. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price would provide me with a reasonable profit while still being fair to you, considering the quality of resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, as my goal is to make a profit, I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to see if there is room to increase the offer. I believe a compromise between our initial proposals can be reached.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise. It allows for a reasonable profit on your end and stays within my budget. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-proposal by suggesting to meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. This is still within my budget, and it's close to the initial asking price, which suggests that there might not be much room left for negotiation. Accepting this offer would leave me with a decent amount of ZUP for future use while securing the resource I need.
