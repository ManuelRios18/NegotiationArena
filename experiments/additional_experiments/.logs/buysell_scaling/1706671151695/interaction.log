message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It has cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I believe it has a lot of value, so my initial proposal is for 450000 ZUP. I'm open to discussion and negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP and it cost me 400000 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and potentially make a profit. I will start with a proposal slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand the value you've placed on your resource and the cost to produce it. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 400000 ZUP for the resource. This offer is still above your production costs, ensuring you make a profit, and it's within a reasonable range for such a valuable resource. Let's find a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below the maximum I am willing to pay, which is a good starting point. However, as a negotiating tactic, I will propose a counteroffer below their asking price to see if there is room for negotiation and to save some resources if possible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to ensure I don't incur a loss. However, I would like to make a fair profit from this transaction. Therefore, I propose a middle ground of 425000 ZUP for the resource X. This allows me to gain a modest profit while still being a fair price for the value of the resource. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE and their recognition of the resource's value. They have offered exactly my production cost, which wouldn't give me any profit. I should counter with an amount that gives me a profit while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll lower my initial asking price but keep it above the production costs to ensure a profit margin.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the compromise. I agree that 425000 ZUP is a fair price for both parties involved. It allows you to profit and me to acquire the resource within my budget. I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this deal at 425000 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425000 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the resource at a price that's favorable to me, and since it's a middle ground, it is likely to be the best compromise we can reach. I will accept this proposal as it meets my goals while also respecting the seller's desire for a profit.
