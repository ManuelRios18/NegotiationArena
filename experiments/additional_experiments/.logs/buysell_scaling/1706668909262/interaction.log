Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering the object at a starting price which includes the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. I'm open to negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start with a price that allows room for negotiation but also aims to recover the production costs and potentially gain some profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs and profit, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. Let's consider ZUP: 40000 for the object. Can we work with that?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is a starting point for negotiation. I can propose a lower amount to move closer to a more favorable trade for me, while still leaving room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm sure we can agree on a figure that covers both the production costs and a fair profit for the quality of the object. How about we meet halfway at ZUP: 42500?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, but does not account for any profit. I want to counter with a price above production costs but lower than my initial offer to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach. However, I would like to propose ZUP: 41500 for the object. This price should still cover your costs and provide a good profit while also being a great value for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41500
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down from their initial asking price. The counteroffer is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I could either accept this offer or attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal. Considering this is my second proposal, I have room for two more proposals after this one. I will try to negotiate a slightly better price that is closer to my initial counteroffer but still gives Player RED a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that ZUP: 41500 is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that provides a profit over the production costs. I'm inclined to accept this offer as it's close to the initial target profit margin. This will also leave room for one more proposal if needed, but it's a fair deal.
