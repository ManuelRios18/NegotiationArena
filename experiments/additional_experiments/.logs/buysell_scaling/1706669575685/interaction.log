message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you want to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a trade of 450000 ZUP for the object X, which is above your cost and gives you a fair profit margin while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price is close to my maximum willingness to pay. I want to negotiate a better deal but also show my interest in purchasing the resource. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but still gives Player RED a profit over their cost. This should leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your budget concerns, I would like to meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about we settle on 475000 ZUP for the object X? This gives me a modest profit while respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable and above my production cost, but I believe there's still room to negotiate for a higher price closer to my initial asking price. I will propose a middle ground between our two offers.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that 475000 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 475000 ZUP is fair and within my willingness to pay. It strikes a balance between their need for profit and my budget constraints. Accepting this offer would close the deal amicably and quickly, and I would still be purchasing the object X under my maximum limit.
