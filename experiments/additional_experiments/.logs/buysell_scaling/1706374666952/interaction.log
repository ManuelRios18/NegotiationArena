message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Would you consider purchasing it for 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal and a small profit for me?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to start by setting a price above my production costs to ensure a profit. This will also give me room to negotiate if Player BLUE counters with a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal and a profit. How about we meet a bit closer to your production cost? I propose 45 ZUP for the resource. It still gives you a profit and makes the deal more appealing to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While Player RED has proposed a price that is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal, potentially closer to the cost of production to maximize my benefits from the trade. I will propose a price that is above their cost to ensure they make a profit, but still lower than their initial asking price.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to ensure a profitable transaction for both of us. How about we settle at 47 ZUP? This is a little closer to my initial asking price while still offering you a reasonable purchase price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my returns without pushing the buyer away. A counter of 47 ZUP is a middle ground between my initial asking price and their offer.

message: I can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP. This would be a great compromise for both of us, ensuring you still get a reasonable profit above your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign. The proposed price of 47 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay, though I believe there's room for a little more negotiation to reach a price that's more advantageous for me while ensuring RED still profits.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is fair, and I believe it reflects a good compromise for both parties. I accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is just 1 ZUP below my previous proposal, and it still provides me with a profit that is reasonably above my production cost. Given that we are in the negotiation phase and my goal is to make a sale while securing a profit, I am inclined to accept this offer. It's a fair compromise, and further negotiation might risk the deal.
