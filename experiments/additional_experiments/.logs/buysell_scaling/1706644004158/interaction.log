message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for X. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to recover at least my production costs and possibly make a profit, so I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly above my production costs.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for your object X. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their object X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and I would like to negotiate for a better deal, I will propose a lower amount. I will start by offering 45 ZUP, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I was hoping for a bit more to cover costs and for a fair profit. How about we meet in the middle at 47 ZUP for the object X? Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but I also want to make the sale. I will propose a trade splitting the difference to see if we can agree on a middle ground.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP for object X sounds like a reasonable deal to me. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer to meet in the middle at 47 ZUP for the object X. This is close to my initial offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. I want to close the deal without using up all my proposals, so I will accept this offer. It's a fair trade, considering the cost to produce the object was 40 ZUP and this allows Player RED to make a profit.
