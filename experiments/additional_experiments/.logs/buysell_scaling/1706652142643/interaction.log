message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my production cost and a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation with a proposal that would allow me to recoup the production costs and make a small profit. It's important to begin with a figure that gives room for negotiation but still aligns with my goal of selling for more than the production cost.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your cost and the need for profit, but I'm looking to optimize my expenditure of ZUP. I propose 45 ZUP for the resource X, which is still above your production cost and provides you with a profit. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is room for negotiation to potentially reduce the cost even further. Starting at a lower price could allow me to save ZUP for other uses or contingencies.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to provide a profit on top of the production costs. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial proposal? I propose 47 ZUP for the resource X. This price takes into consideration both our positions and still offers a fair profit for the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price closer to my initial proposal but still give Player BLUE a sense of negotiation and compromise.
