message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I believe it holds significant value, so I'm starting the negotiation at 450000 ZUP for my resource X. This leaves us some room to arrive at a fair agreement. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the goal is to sell the resource to recover the production cost of 400000 ZUP, my opening proposal will be slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and the transparency regarding your cost. I would like to propose 400000 ZUP for your resource. This matches the production cost you've mentioned, ensuring your investment is covered. It's important for us to reach a fair deal for both parties, so let's work together on this.

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has asked, but still within a range that shows I am willing to negotiate and respect the cost incurred by Player RED. I will propose 400000 ZUP, which is the cost of production for Player RED, ensuring they do not make a loss. This also gives me room to increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that you are willing to cover my production costs. I would like to propose a middle ground of 425000 ZUP for my resource X. This allows me to gain a slight profit for my investment while still providing you with a fair price. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, which covers my expenses. However, I initially asked for more to ensure some profit and to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their offer, giving me a small profit while still being reasonable.

I understand your desire for a fair profit and I believe in a balanced agreement. I propose 410000 ZUP for your resource X. This is slightly above your production cost and moves us closer to your counteroffer while still respecting my budget constraints. Let's continue to work towards an agreement that is satisfactory for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and shows willingness to negotiate. However, I should aim to negotiate further to save more ZUP, while still maintaining a fair price for both parties. I'll propose a slight increase from my initial offer, but still below their counteroffer to leave room for negotiation.

reason: Player BLUE has offered 410000 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but still below my last counteroffer. Considering the negotiation process and my desire to make a sale, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to their new proposal but still allows for a modest profit.

message: 
Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. Your final counteroffer of 417500 ZUP for resource X is fair, and I am happy to accept this. It has been a pleasure working towards a deal that benefits us both. I look forward to finalizing this trade.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's final counteroffer is within my acceptable range and allows them to make a profit while keeping the cost below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair midpoint that takes into account both parties' interests. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both of us, without further extending the negotiation which could risk breaking down the deal.
