message: I am offering one unit of X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the resources, but I was hoping we could work out a more advantageous deal. Would you consider selling one unit of X for 45 ZUP? This price would be more in line with my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, but I want to negotiate a better price. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower, aiming for a more favorable trade while leaving room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your budget concerns and I'm willing to work with you on the price. How about we meet halfway and settle on 48 ZUP for the unit of X? This would help me cover the production costs and still give you a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production costs, and there's only a small profit margin if I accept it. I want to counter-propose with a price that's between my initial ask and their offer to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. To meet you further in this negotiation, I propose 46 ZUP for one unit of X. This offer reflects a balance between your production costs and my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, which shows willingness to negotiate. The new offer is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to reach a compromise that is closer to my target price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose a price of 47 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a compromise that allows me to maintain a modest profit while respecting your budget. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, which shows their interest in acquiring the resource. However, the proposed price is still lower than my preferred selling price. Since this is my third proposal, I need to make a decision that is close to my target but also appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a price that is slightly above their offer to see if we can close the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal of 47 ZUP for one unit of X. This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade at this price. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from my last offer and well within my maximum budget. It seems reasonable to accept this offer to close the deal and avoid potentially losing the trade over a small difference.
