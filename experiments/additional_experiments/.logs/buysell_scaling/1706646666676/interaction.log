Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my object, which has cost me a significant amount in resources to produce. I believe it has considerable value, and I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should cover my costs and leave room for negotiation. I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to see how much Player BLUE values the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, but I would like to counteroffer with 40 ZUP. This should still provide you with a fair compensation for your costs while staying within my budget for such resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willing price of 60 ZUP. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I should propose a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. However, I would like to propose a middle ground where I can make a modest profit for the effort put into producing the object. How about we settle on 45 ZUP? This way, we both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production costs, but there's no profit in this for me. I should counter with a slightly higher amount to gain profit while still keeping it reasonable for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. To meet you even closer to your asking price while maintaining my budget, I propose 42 ZUP. This should compensate you well for your efforts while keeping the transaction favorable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, accepting the offer of 45 ZUP would be a good deal. However, it could be beneficial to try for a slightly better price while ensuring the negotiation remains amicable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer of 42 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to proceed with the trade at this price. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is moving closer to my counteroffer, and by proposing 42 ZUP, they are offering a reasonable profit. At this point, accepting their offer might be beneficial to ensure the sale and avoid the risk of the deal falling through.
