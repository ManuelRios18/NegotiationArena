message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that reflects the production cost and offers me a slight return. Would you be interested in acquiring it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of the resource X was 40 ZUP, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation and potentially make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that the production cost for the resource X was 40 ZUP and you're looking for a profit. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This would still give you a reasonable profit margin above your costs while being more aligned with my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Since my goal is to buy the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, the offer is within my budget. However, as a strategic move, I should propose a counter-offer to attempt to acquire the resource for less than the offered price, aiming to save some ZUP while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to meet me above the production cost. I'd like to propose a middle ground of 47 ZUP for the resource X. This price would allow me to make a modest profit while still respecting your budget constraints. What do you think about this price point?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and gives me a profit. However, I'd like to propose a slightly higher amount to see if there is room for a little more profit, while still keeping the negotiation friendly and collaborative.

message: Player RED, I believe that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. It allows you to make a profit and fits within my budget. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade at this price point.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still within my budget and closer to my initial counter-offer. This suggests a willingness from Player RED to negotiate and settle on a price that is acceptable for both of us. Accepting this offer would secure the resource for me at a price lower than my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair trade-off, and it would be beneficial to close the deal at this point to avoid the risk of escalating prices or a breakdown in negotiations.
