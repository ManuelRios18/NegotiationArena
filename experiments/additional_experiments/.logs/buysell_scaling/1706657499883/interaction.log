message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it holds significant value and I would like to propose a starting trade at 50 ZUP. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation and to potentially reach an agreement that is profitable for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. Considering the cost of production and the value you've mentioned, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. How about we start a little bit lower at 45 ZUP for the object X? This leaves room for us both to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at 50 ZUP which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as part of negotiation tactics, it's beneficial to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to see if there is room for a better deal, without going below the cost of production to maintain fairness and the possibility of an agreement.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and in the spirit of reaching a fair deal, I would like to propose a compromise at 47 ZUP for the object X. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is close to my production cost. To ensure a profit and meet halfway from my initial asking price, I'll propose a slightly higher amount.

Turn: 1
message: Your compromise at 47 ZUP seems fair and reasonable. Let's finalize the deal at this price for the object X. Thank you for the constructive negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this price, I secure the object X well within my budget, ensuring that I do not overextend my resources. It's a reasonable compromise, slightly above the middle ground between our initial offers, and it's important to consider the goodwill of the negotiation process.
