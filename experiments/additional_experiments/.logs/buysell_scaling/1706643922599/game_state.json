This shows willingness to negotiate. Since 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and only slightly higher than my first counteroffer, I could consider meeting closer to this number but still aim to save some resources. A counteroffer of 47 ZUP would be a compromise showing willingness to close the deal while still attempting to conserve resources. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. Your adjusted proposal is definitely moving in the right direction. To further our progress towards a deal, I am willing to offer 47 ZUP for the object X.
