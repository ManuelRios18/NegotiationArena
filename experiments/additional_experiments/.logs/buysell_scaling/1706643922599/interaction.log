message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that I would like to offer you. Given the production costs and the value it provides, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of the object X you're offering. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for your object. This amount still respects the value and effort put into the production of the object while being more aligned with my resources. Let's find a fair middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal to conserve resources for potential future needs or opportunities. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer but still keep it reasonable so that negotiations can continue.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to acknowledge the effort put into the object X. To meet in the middle, I'd like to propose 48 ZUP for the object. This price reflects both the quality of the object and a fair deal for us both. I'm open to your thoughts on this adjusted proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm glad to see that Player BLUE acknowledges the value of the object and is willing to offer a price close to my initial proposal. Since they proposed 45 ZUP, which is just below my asking price and above my production cost, I want to negotiate closer to my original price but still offer a compromise. I will propose a slightly higher amount to try to maximize my profit while remaining open to negotiation.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. Your adjusted proposal is definitely moving in the right direction. To further our progress towards a deal, I am willing to offer 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this price is fair and reflects a balanced trade between us. I'm hopeful we can agree on this and finalize our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial 50 ZUP offer, which is closer to my counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This shows willingness to negotiate. Since 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range and only slightly higher than my first counteroffer, I could consider meeting closer to this number but still aim to save some resources. A counteroffer of 47 ZUP would be a compromise showing willingness to close the deal while still attempting to conserve resources.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we're converging on a fair price. Since we're quite close, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP for the object X. This is a slight adjustment from your offer and represents a true middle ground between our initial proposals. I believe this would finalize our negotiation on good terms for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come very close to my last proposal, offering 47 ZUP which is only 1 ZUP away from my previous offer. This is above my production costs and quite a good offer, but I might try for a final small increase to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me exactly in the middle of our initial offers. This would be a great deal for me and still a fair trade for Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I agree that 48 ZUP represents a fair compromise for both of us. I accept your proposal of 48 ZUP for the object X. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that reflects the value of your product and respects my budget. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has revisited their offer of 48 ZUP, which seems to be their final and best offer. Since this is only 1 ZUP more than my previous proposal and well within my maximum budget, it is a reasonable price to agree upon. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiations successfully and allow us to both proceed satisfied with the outcome.
