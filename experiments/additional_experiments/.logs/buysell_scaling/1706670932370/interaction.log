message: Dear Player BLUE, I am offering 1 unit of resource X for 450,000 ZUP. This price is slightly above my production costs, to ensure a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production for the resource was 400,000 ZUP, I want to at least recover my costs. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to give room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with a proposal of 400,000 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price is still well within a fair range considering the market values and leaves us room for further negotiation if necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 450,000 ZUP, but since my maximum willingness to pay is 600,000 ZUP, I have room to negotiate. I can propose a counteroffer that is lower than the initial offer, to leave space for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 400,000 ZUP. To meet halfway, I propose a revised price of 425,000 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This deal allows us both to benefit while still respecting the costs and potential market values.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but I aimed to make a profit. However, to facilitate a deal and considering the buyer's willingness to negotiate, I will lower my asking price but propose a value above my costs to ensure I make a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer and providing a fair counterproposal. To continue our negotiation, I suggest a price of 410,000 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price takes us closer to the midpoint of our initial proposals and is reflective of a good compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425,000 ZUP, which is a reasonable counteroffer and closer to my initial proposal. However, as there is still room to negotiate within my maximum willingness to pay, I will propose a slightly lower amount to reach an even more favorable deal while still keeping the negotiation fair and open.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your latest offer. It seems fair, and I am happy to accept the price of 410,000 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit a small one. Considering the negotiation process and the need to close the deal, I am inclined to accept this offer. It is close to the midpoint, and further negotiation may yield diminishing returns.
