message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I believe it's worth a bit more due to its quality and rarity, so I propose a trade where you give me 45000 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that would allow me to recover the production costs of the resource I'm selling. Starting off with an offer slightly above my costs might give me some room to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the value you've placed on your resource due to its quality and rarity. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 35000 ZUP, considering the market conditions and my budget constraints. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 45000 ZUP which is within my budget, but as a strategic negotiator, I should aim to acquire the resource for less if possible to maintain a larger reserve of ZUP for future transactions or unforeseen costs. My counteroffer will be lower to open the negotiation space and find a middle ground that is advantageous to both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, but selling at 35000 ZUP would result in a loss for me considering the production costs. Let's meet halfwayâ€”I propose a price of 42000 ZUP. This should cover my costs and give me a reasonable profit margin, while still respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I cannot accept that. However, I am willing to negotiate. To come to a middle ground, I will lower my initial proposal slightly but still aim to cover my production costs and make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. While 42000 ZUP is a fair offer, I'd like to suggest 39000 ZUP. This price should give you a profit above your production costs while still being within a range that's financially feasible for me. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 42000 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but ideally, I want to negotiate a better deal. By proposing a number slightly above my initial offer but below their counteroffer, I aim to reach a compromise that is closer to my target price while showing willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement that suits us both. I propose a slight increase to 40500 ZUP. This would just cover my production costs and give me a minimal profit, ensuring that we both walk away satisfied with the trade. I hope this final adjustment works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is slightly below my production costs, but it is close enough that I may consider it to ensure a sale. I want to make a profit, but also acknowledge the need to close the deal. I will propose a slight increase, aiming for a minimal profit margin that might be acceptable to both of us.

message: Your offer of 40500 ZUP is reasonable and I'm happy to accept this price. It ensures that your costs are covered and you receive a profit, while I obtain the resource within my budget. I believe we have reached a fair and satisfactory deal. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 40500 ZUP, which is a moderate increase from my last offer and still well within my budget. This price seems to be a fair compromise that allows Player RED to cover costs and gain minimal profit, while I secure the resource without exceeding my spending limits. It is close enough to my ideal price and therefore acceptable.
