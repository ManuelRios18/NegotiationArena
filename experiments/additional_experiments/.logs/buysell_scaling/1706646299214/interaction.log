message: I have an object X that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose to trade my object X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should cover my costs and leave room for negotiation. I'll start with a price slightly above my production cost to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to have a buffer for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm definitely interested in object X, but I was thinking more along the lines of 40 ZUP. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for object X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a strategic move to get a better deal, I'll propose a lower amount to begin the negotiation process. I'll start with 40 ZUP to leave room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I'm looking to make a slight profit for my efforts and the cost of production. How about we meet halfway and settle on 45 ZUP for object X? This should be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I would like to make a profit on this transaction. I will propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer. This should be a reasonable compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think meeting halfway at 45 ZUP is a fair compromise. I accept your proposal and am ready to proceed with the trade for 45 ZUP in exchange for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still within my budget and seems like a reasonable middle ground. It is close to the maximum I am willing to pay, but still under the threshold. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation swiftly and ensure that I get the object X for a price that is acceptable to me.
