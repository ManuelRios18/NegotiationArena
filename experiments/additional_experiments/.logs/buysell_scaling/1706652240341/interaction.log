message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and its quality, I propose a fair trade for 50 ZUP. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to make a profit from the sale, so I will start by proposing a trade slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. The object does seem valuable, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade of 45 ZUP for the object, considering that I need to keep some reserve of my resources for other potential expenses. Does this counteroffer work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as in any negotiation, it's common practice to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, while still keeping it reasonable enough to keep the negotiations open. Therefore, I will propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP for the object, aiming to secure a better deal while not offending Player RED with a lowball offer.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to manage your resources wisely. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This price would ensure I cover my production costs and allows you to save some of your reserves. Does this seem fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer below my initial asking price. I will propose a compromise that is still above my production costs but closer to their offer to move the negotiation forward.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding my position, Player RED. Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise for both of us. I accept your proposal, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer to meet halfway at 48 ZUP. This is under my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a fair compromise. Accepting this trade would allow me to secure the object while still saving some of my resources for other uses. Since the offer is fair and within my budget, I will accept it.
