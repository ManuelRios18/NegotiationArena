message: I have a high-quality resource X available. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a starting price that is higher than my cost, expecting Player BLUE to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I value the quality of the resource X you're offering. To ensure we can reach a deal that is mutually beneficial, I propose 45 ZUP for the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as it's the start of the negotiation, it is standard to propose a counteroffer to see if there is room for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and your recognition of the resource's quality. To come to a fair agreement, I propose a slight adjustment to 48 ZUP. I believe this reflects the value of the resource well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is close to my initial asking price. This offer covers my production costs and gives me a small profit. However, there might be room for a slightly higher price, so I will counter with a small increase, aiming to meet in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. Meeting in the middle, I propose 46 ZUP for the resource X. I think this offer is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the resource for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it is advantageous to negotiate a better price if possible. I'll propose a midpoint between our last two offers to show willingness to compromise and to move the negotiations forward.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects the value of the resource for both of us. I accept your offer. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that gives me a profit that is above my production costs. It is only slightly lower than my last proposal, and further negotiation could risk the deal. It's important to know when to close a deal, and this offer seems fair and close to my target price.
