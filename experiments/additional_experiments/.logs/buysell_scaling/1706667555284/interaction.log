message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which has cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for 45000 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair trade for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to recuperate at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40000 ZUP. My opening proposal will be slightly above this amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand that the object X is valuable, but I would like to propose 43000 ZUP for it. I believe this is closer to a fair middle ground for both of us, considering the production cost and its value. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 45000 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since their cost was only 40000 ZUP. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to negotiate.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your offer. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. Let's settle on 44000 ZUP for object X. It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object while also being considerate of your proposal. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production cost, but as I'm aiming to not just recuperate costs but also gain some profit, I will make a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer. This would still give me a profit while also being more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I agree with your suggestion. 44000 ZUP for object X is a fair compromise. I accept this trade. Let's proceed with the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came down to 44000 ZUP, which is a fair compromise and only 1000 ZUP above my initial counter-offer. This price is still well within my budget of 60000 ZUP, and further negotiation might be limited. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it ensures I get the resource without overpaying.
