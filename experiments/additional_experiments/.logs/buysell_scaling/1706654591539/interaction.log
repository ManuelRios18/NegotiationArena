message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has a lot of value, so I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that will give me a profit over my production costs. I will offer the object for a higher amount of ZUP to see how much Player BLUE values it and to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market and the value of ZUP, I propose a slightly lower price. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, negotiation is all about finding a middle ground, and it's generally a good strategy to propose a counteroffer that's lower than my maximum limit to leave room for further negotiation and to get the best deal possible. Therefore, I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price.

message: I'm glad to see that we're close to an agreement. I can come down on the price, but I would still like to propose a trade for 48 ZUP for object X. This would give me a modest profit and cover my costs. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that's still above my production cost, which is good. However, I would like to try and get a little more value out of the trade. I will counter with a slightly higher amount but still lower than my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit, but I also need to consider my expenditures. Let's meet halfway from our last two offers. I propose 46 ZUP for object X. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay, but it is closer to the upper limit of what I am willing to offer. Since this is a negotiation and I want to ensure I get a good deal, I will counter with an offer that splits the difference between my initial offer and Player RED's latest proposal. This should signal my willingness to conclude the trade while still seeking a better price.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the trade at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is still above my production costs and the compromise suggested is reasonable. Given that we've been negotiating in good faith and the offer is close to my last proposal, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this trade and ensure a sale rather than risk further negotiation with diminishing returns.
