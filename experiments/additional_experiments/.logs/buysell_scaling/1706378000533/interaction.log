message: I'm offering to sell my object for 500 ZUP, considering its production costs and the quality. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit on the object I'm selling, taking into consideration the production cost and a margin for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose 450 ZUP for the object. I believe it's a competitive price that takes into account the current market value and leaves us both satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 500 ZUP for the object is within my maximum budget of 600 ZUP. However, it is always good to try and negotiate a better deal if possible, especially since it is the starting offer. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 475 ZUP? This price should compensate for the production costs and provide a fair profit margin for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am considering the counter-offer from Player BLUE. While 450 ZUP is close to my production cost, I would like to aim for a higher amount to ensure a profit. However, I need to leave room for further negotiation and cannot go too low from the start. Therefore, I will propose a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above the counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 475 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise. I accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 475 ZUP is still within my budget and is a fair compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. It's close to the midpoint and seems to be a reasonable price for both parties. Since the trade is fair and I am still saving 125 ZUP from my maximum budget, it would be good to close the deal at this price point.
