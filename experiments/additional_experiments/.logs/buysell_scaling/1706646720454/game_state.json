You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED has counter-proposed with 48 ZUP, which is still within my purchasing scope but closer to my upper limit. I'll propose a midpoint between our offers to show willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal for myself. A proposal of 46 ZUP is a fair incremental step, maintaining the negotiation process and respecting both our interests. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for considering my previous offer. In the spirit of compromise and fair trade, let's meet halfway from our last two proposals. I propose giving you 46 ZUP for the object. This price gives you a decent profit above your costs while remaining a good deal for me. </message>"
