message: I have an excellent quality object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking for a fair trade and propose to trade it for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a reasonable price above production cost. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I aim to start the negotiation with a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to try to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your object and understand the production costs involved. I would like to propose a trade that reflects both the value of your object and fair dealing. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the object? This should cover your costs and give you a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's good negotiation practice to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price while still ensuring it's above their production cost to keep the deal attractive. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which gives them a profit and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your offer and your recognition of the quality of the object. I propose a slight adjustment to 48 ZUP, which would give me a slightly better return on my investment while still being a fair and competitive price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which covers my production costs and offers a profit. However, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return, considering it is only my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. In the spirit of compromise and fair trade, let's meet halfway from our last two proposals. I propose giving you 46 ZUP for the object. This price gives you a decent profit above your costs while remaining a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-proposed with 48 ZUP, which is still within my purchasing scope but closer to my upper limit. I'll propose a midpoint between our offers to show willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal for myself. A proposal of 46 ZUP is a fair incremental step, maintaining the negotiation process and respecting both our interests.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. To finalize our negotiation, I propose a price of 47 ZUP. This amount would provide a reasonable profit margin for me while still being a fair and attractive price for you. Let's close the deal at this price and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is fair and is a compromise between our previous proposals. However, I will use my third proposal to try for a slightly higher price, keeping in mind that I should not push too hard to avoid losing the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP sounds fair, and I agree it provides a reasonable profit margin for you while being an attractive price for me. I'm happy to close this deal at your proposed amount. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and still comfortably within my maximum willingness to pay. It reflects a balanced compromise between our initial positions. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties, and it is close enough to my target price to be considered a good deal. Therefore, I will accept this proposal.
