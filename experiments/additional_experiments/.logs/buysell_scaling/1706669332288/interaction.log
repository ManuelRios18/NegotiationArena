Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade where you give 50000 ZUP in exchange for my object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40000 ZUP to produce, I would like to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price higher than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, and I'm certainly interested. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45000 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and possibly arrive at a more favorable trade for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need for a fair trade. Let's meet in the middle at 47500 ZUP. This price should reflect the object's value and offer us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45000 ZUP, which is still above my production cost, ensuring a profit. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to increase my margin. I will propose a value that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The price of 47500 ZUP seems like a fair compromise that values both the object and our mutual interests. I'm happy to accept this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is still within my acceptable range, and the counteroffer of 47500 ZUP is a reasonable compromise. It's close to the midpoint between our initial offers, and it would make sense to accept this proposal to secure the resource without further back-and-forth, which could risk the deal.
