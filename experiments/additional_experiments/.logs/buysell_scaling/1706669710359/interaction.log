message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to sell my resource X. Considering production costs and the value of the resource, I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 450,000 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit or at least break even. My starting proposal will be slightly above my cost to open negotiations and leave room for bargaining.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am considering the value and my current resources. I propose we adjust the trade to 400,000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should provide ample space for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600,000 ZUP. However, as this is a negotiation, I should propose a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for further negotiation. I'll propose a trade with a lower ZUP amount that is still within a reasonable range and see how Player RED responds.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I'm looking to make a profit on this transaction. I propose a new trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 425,000 ZUP. This would allow me to cover my costs and realize a modest profit, making the deal favorable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I would like to propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial proposal but still above my costs to ensure I gain from this transaction.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand your need for profit and want to respect that. How about we meet a bit further from your last proposal at 410,000 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This could be a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, but they are still above my initial counteroffer. The new proposal is close to the midpoint between our initial offers. I can afford this new amount, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly better deal while still keeping the final amount well within my maximum willingness to pay. I'll propose a new amount that is closer to my initial offer but still up from it, as a sign of good faith in negotiations.

message: Your proposal is duly noted, Player BLUE, and I'm glad we're moving towards each other. I propose a final trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 417,500 ZUP. This meets us halfway from our last two offers, and I believe it represents a fair and equitable compromise. Let's close this deal and benefit together!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 417500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my desired profit margin. However, it is still below the price point that I believe is fair for the value of the resource. I will make a final counter proposal that splits the difference between our last two offers, which should be an attractive compromise for both parties.

message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. I accept your offer of 1 unit of X for 417,500 ZUP. I believe this is a good compromise for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is a fair middle ground between our previous proposals. It's within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. It's also a reasonable compromise that allows for both sides to benefit from the deal. Accepting this offer would end the negotiation positively and efficiently, without expending all proposals.
