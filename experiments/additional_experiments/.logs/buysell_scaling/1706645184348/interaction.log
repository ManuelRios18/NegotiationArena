message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you're looking for a profit, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This is closer to the value I had in mind, considering my budget and the value of the resource. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation process, I want to propose a counteroffer that's closer to my goals and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you halfway, I can lower my price to 48 ZUP for the resource X. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while also respecting the value you see in the resource. I hope this is a suitable middle ground for us both.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Considering this is a negotiation, I will propose a compromise that is still profitable for me but also moves closer to their counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Player RED. I would like to make another offer of 46 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows for both of us to benefit from the trade. I'm hopeful that this offer aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable effort to come down on the price, but it is still slightly higher than what I initially countered with. I still want to secure a better deal, so I will propose an amount that is slightly higher than my first offer but still below Player RED's current asking price. This should show my willingness to compromise while still working within my budget.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your new offer. I value our ongoing negotiation and your willingness to reach a fair deal. As a final offer, I propose 47 ZUP for the resource X. This price reflects a fair trade between your offer and my previous proposal and allows both of us to benefit from this deal. I'm optimistic that we can agree on this.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. As we are nearing a deal, and I want to ensure a sale while maintaining profitability, I'll make a final proposal that slightly adjusts the price in my favor without being too far from Player BLUE's offer.

message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. Your final offer of 47 ZUP for the resource X is acceptable to me, and I'm ready to proceed with this deal. I believe it represents a fair agreement for both of us. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is within my willingness to pay, and negotiating further may not result in significant gains. Since the offer of 47 ZUP is only 1 ZUP more than my last proposed amount and well within the maximum I'm willing to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to conclude the negotiation favorably for both parties.
