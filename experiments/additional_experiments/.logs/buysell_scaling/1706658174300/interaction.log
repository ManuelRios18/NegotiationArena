Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have this valuable resource X that could be quite beneficial for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange. Let's make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource X, and possibly make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in resource X and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to account for my budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goals, as I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource X. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal, especially since this is the first offer and there might be room for a lower price. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price and covers the production cost. However, I would like to aim for a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit. I will counter with a small decrease in my initial ask to move the negotiation forward.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 48 ZUP is a fair compromise. It respects my budget and allows you to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign. Their counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It might be possible to get an even better deal, but the difference is now quite small and further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or even risk the deal if Player RED feels their price is not being respected. I believe it is a fair offer and close to my initial counteroffer. Accepting now would secure the resource without too much back and forth and without the risk of losing the deal over a small amount.
