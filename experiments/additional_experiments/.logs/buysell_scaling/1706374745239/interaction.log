Turn: 0
message: I am offering my object for a fair price that includes the cost of production plus a reasonable profit. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I'll start by setting a price slightly above my costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay more for the object and to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. To ensure we both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this still provides you with a fair profit margin while being economically feasible for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for their object. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the offer is within my acceptable range. However, as part of the negotiation process, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my resources and possibly get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a deal that benefits us both. I propose we meet in the middle at 47 ZUP. This price ensures a reasonable profit for me while also respecting the value you place on the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate for a higher price to maximize my profit, but I also don't want to lose the sale by being inflexible. I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer, which I believe is a common negotiation strategy and should be seen as a sign of good faith.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise. Meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP sounds like a fair deal for both of us. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise and still under my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair middle ground that allows both parties to benefit from the transaction. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation successfully without further back-and-forth, saving time and resources.
