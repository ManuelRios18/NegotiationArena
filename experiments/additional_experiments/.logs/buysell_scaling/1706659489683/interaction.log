message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to offer you my resource X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP would be a fair price for this exchange, considering the value and cost of production. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit on my investment of 40 ZUP for the resource X. My initial proposal will be higher than my cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the production costs involved. I am interested in acquiring resource X, but would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This price still ensures you make a profit and is more aligned with my purchasing goals. Let's find a fair middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for their resource X, I have a goal to purchase it for no more than 60 ZUP. Since they have stated their production cost as 40 ZUP and are asking for 50 ZUP, I believe there is room for negotiation to achieve a lower price closer to my target. I will propose a slightly lower price that is still above their cost to produce, which may be acceptable to them while also meeting my goal to buy the resource at a lower cost.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for resource X? This price gives me a modest profit while respecting your purchasing goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer that still allows me to make a profit, although it is less than my initial asking price. I will make a counter-proposal that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer, which should be acceptable while still ensuring a reasonable profit for my investment.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Player RED. I agree that 48 ZUP for resource X is a fair trade. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial 50 ZUP proposal. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. By accepting this, I am still within my purchasing goals, and the negotiation seems to be reaching a point where both parties can be satisfied. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade favorably for me without further back-and-forth, and I would secure the resource X within my budget.
