message: I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe 500 ZUP is a fair initial asking price considering production costs and the value of the resource. Let's negotiate a price that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. I need to recover at least my production costs of 400 ZUP, but since this is a negotiation, I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand your production costs and the value you've attached to resource X. However, I'd like to propose 450 ZUP for the resource, considering I have to maintain a budget and also account for my own costs associated with acquiring and utilizing the resource. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 600 ZUP for the resources, I will start by proposing a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal of 450 ZUP and understand your budget concerns. To meet halfway, I propose 475 ZUP for resource X. This price reflects a fair compromise for the value of the resource and our respective costs. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 450 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to aim for a higher profit margin while remaining open to negotiation. Splitting the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer could be an acceptable middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to meet halfway. I propose 465 ZUP as a further step towards a middle ground. This price should cover your production costs while also respecting my budget constraints. I am hopeful we can agree on this figure and proceed with the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 465
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 475 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly lower price that is beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am grateful for your counteroffer of 465 ZUP and your effort to reach an agreement. I propose a small increase to 470 ZUP as my final counteroffer. This price allows us both to achieve our goals while valuing resource X appropriately. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope we can settle on this and finalize our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 470
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 465 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase from their last offer and still provides me with a profit over my production costs. However, it's slightly below the price I just proposed. Considering that this is a negotiation and we are close to an agreement, I can choose to accept this offer to close the deal quickly or try to push for a slightly higher price. I will make one final counteroffer to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, but I'll keep it close to their offer to show my willingness to conclude the negotiations.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your final counteroffer of 470 ZUP and your flexibility throughout this negotiation. I accept this offer as it aligns with my budget and allows us both to fulfill our respective goals. Let's proceed with the transaction at this agreed price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 470 ZUP is very close to my initial counterproposal and still well within my maximum willingness to pay. It seems to be a fair price that respects both our positions, and further negotiation may not yield significant benefits.
