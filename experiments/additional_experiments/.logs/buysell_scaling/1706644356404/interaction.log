Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X that I'm willing to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking for a fair offer that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for this item. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My goal is to sell X for more than 40 ZUP to cover production costs and make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade at a higher value to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the item. This still gives you a profit and allows me to make a reasonable purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower price that still gives Player RED a profit over their cost but saves me some ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and understand your position. To meet halfway, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP. This allows for a better profit on my end while still being a reasonable deal for you. Let's make it a win-win situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and does provide me with a profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my returns. I will propose a midpoint between my initial asking price and the counteroffer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? This is slightly above the middle ground between our initial offers and should be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still within an acceptable range. I believe there's room for a bit more negotiation to reach an even more favorable deal, but I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard. I'll propose a slightly lower amount that is more favorable to me yet still above their cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer of 46 ZUP for the item. It's a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The new offer is a compromise between our positions. It is a slight increase from the previous offer and still provides me with a profit above my production costs. Since the game allows for only one more proposal from my side, it might be strategic to accept this offer rather than risk a stalemate or a lower offer in the next round.
