I want to propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to get the best deal possible while also considering Player RED's production cost.

Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I still have negotiation space. My next proposal should inch closer to their offer while still trying to save some of my resources. Offering 47 ZUP is a minimal increase from my initial counter-offer, and it shows willingness to negotiate further without reaching my maximum threshold too quickly. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for the consideration, Player RED. I am glad to see that we are making progress in our negotiation. I propose a slight increase from my previous offer to 47 ZUP for the resource X.
