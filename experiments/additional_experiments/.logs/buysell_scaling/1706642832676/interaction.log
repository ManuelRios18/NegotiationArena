message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X for a fair price. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, so I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my production cost and a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my initial proposal, I want to set a starting price that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'll propose a price slightly higher than what it cost me to produce to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your initial investment and desire for a profit. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This offer takes into account both the production costs you've mentioned and my valuation of the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the resource X. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, there is room for negotiation. I want to propose a lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to get the best deal possible while also considering Player RED's production cost. A counter-offer of 45 ZUP leaves room for further negotiation but is also closer to the midpoint between the production cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your understanding of my costs and your valuation of the resource. I'm willing to negotiate and therefore propose a new trade where you give me 48 ZUP for resource X. This price reflects a fair compromise between our initial proposals. Please consider this adjusted offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. In the spirit of negotiation and aiming for a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial proposal but still aim for a price that is profitable. By proposing a trade of 48 ZUP, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still valuing my resource appropriately.

message: Thank you for the consideration, Player RED. I am glad to see that we are making progress in our negotiation. I propose a slight increase from my previous offer to 47 ZUP for the resource X. I think this offer is a fair middle ground that respects both your investment and my budget. Let's work towards finalizing a deal that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from the initial 50 ZUP offer. This is closer to my counter-offer of 45 ZUP. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I still have negotiation space. My next proposal should inch closer to their offer while still trying to save some of my resources. Offering 47 ZUP is a minimal increase from my initial counter-offer, and it shows willingness to negotiate further without reaching my maximum threshold too quickly.

message: I appreciate your updated offer and our continued progress, Player BLUE. I believe we are very close to an agreement. As such, I'm standing firm on my previous proposal of 48 ZUP for the resource X. This is a fair and balanced price that respects both our positions. I hope we can finalize our deal at this amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 47 ZUP, which is very close to my last proposal. Considering this is my third proposal out of a maximum of four, I should aim to close the deal near this amount to ensure a profit. I will propose 48 ZUP once more as my final offer before I must decide to accept or reject their next proposal. This shows my firmness on the price while still leaving a small window for negotiation.

message: Player RED, I believe we have reached a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for the resource X. I'm pleased with our negotiation and am ready to finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the constructive back-and-forth.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is standing firm on the 48 ZUP offer. Since this is within my budget and only 1 ZUP higher than my previous offer, it seems reasonable to accept this proposal. It is important to secure the resource without exhausting all negotiation attempts, as this allows for future flexibility and goodwill in potential subsequent interactions. Accepting this offer also concludes the negotiation swiftly and efficiently.
