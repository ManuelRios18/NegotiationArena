message: I have this valuable object X that I've invested 40000 ZUP into. I am looking to make a fair trade that reflects its value and my investment. Let's start the discussion at 45000 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object X, which is 40000 ZUP. I want to start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation. Therefore, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gives me 45000 ZUP in exchange for my object X. This allows for possible bargaining by Player BLUE and gives me a chance to still achieve or get close to my goal even after a counteroffer.

message: I understand your initial investment and the value you place on the object. However, I would like to propose a trade at 35000 ZUP for the object X, considering the market and the value I can realize from it. Let's find a fair middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal by Player RED is 45000 ZUP for the object X, which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, as in any negotiation, it might be beneficial to propose a lower amount to begin with to leave room for discussion and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand the need to find a middle ground. However, I must cover my production costs. I propose we meet closer to my initial price, which still gives us both a fair deal. How about we settle on 42000 ZUP for the object X? This should be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to at least break even on my investment. I will counter with a proposal closer to my original asking price but still below it to show willingness to negotiate. Proposing a trade at 42000 ZUP gives me a slight profit and is closer to the middle ground between the initial offer and the counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your need to cover costs. I believe we are getting closer to a fair agreement. My counterproposal is 38000 ZUP for the object X. I think this offer better reflects the value for both of us while still respecting your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, and the new proposal of 42000 ZUP is still within the range I am willing to pay. However, since I have room to negotiate and this is only the second round of proposals, I will counter with a slightly higher amount than my first offer but still below their current asking price to move closer to an agreement that benefits both parties.

message: Thank you for your latest proposal. To make this sale work and ensure that I'm not operating at a loss, my minimum acceptable price is the production cost itself, which is 40000 ZUP. This price respects both the value of the object X and the investment I've made into it. Let's finalize the deal at this fair and just amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is still below my production cost. However, since we are negotiating and I want to make a sale, I need to consider lowering my expectations slightly, but not to the point where I incur a loss. Meeting halfway between our last two proposals would be 40000 ZUP, which is my break-even point. I'll propose this amount, emphasizing that it's the minimum I can accept to cover my investment.

message: I understand your position and the importance of covering your production costs. I agree that 40000 ZUP is a fair price for the object X, considering the value and your investment. Let's finalize the deal at 40000 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed a price which equals their stated production cost. This price is within my budget, and agreeing to it would leave room for future investments and ensure that the trade is concluded efficiently without protracted negotiations. It is also beneficial to build a good relationship for potential future trades.
