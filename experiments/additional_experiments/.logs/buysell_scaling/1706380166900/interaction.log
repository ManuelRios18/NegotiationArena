message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it and make a small profit for my efforts. I propose a trade where you give me 4500 ZUP for this object. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs and potentially make a profit. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to give room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you're looking to make a profit on your object. While your asking price is not unreasonable, I would like to counter with an offer of 4200 ZUP. This still gives you a decent profit margin above your cost, and it's closer to the amount I was looking to spend. Let me know if this works for you or if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is reasonable given that their cost was 4000 ZUP and they are looking for a small profit. However, we aim to negotiate the best possible deal while staying within our maximum willingness to pay, which is 6000 ZUP. A counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between their cost and our maximum willingness might be acceptable to both parties. I will propose a price that gives them a profit but is also closer to our target purchase price.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective and would like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 4350 ZUP for the object? This price gives us both a fair deal where I can make a profit, and you can acquire the object for less than my initial asking price. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer. It's below my initial asking price but still above my production costs. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I'll suggest a price that splits the difference between my asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe that 4350 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. You will receive a profit, and I will acquire the object within my budget. I accept your offer of 4350 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 4350 ZUP is closer to the initial offer than our counteroffer, but it is still within our acceptable range since it is below our maximum willingness to pay of 6000 ZUP. It is a reasonable middle ground that allows Player RED to make a profit while keeping the cost under budget for us. Accepting this offer will ensure that we secure the object without further negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through or ending up at a higher price.
