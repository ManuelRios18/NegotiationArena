message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's negotiate a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation and ensure that I can make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value you've placed on resource X, and I am willing to make a fair purchase. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is still a reasonable price that allows for a fair profit margin for you and is closer to the amount I was looking to spend. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as it is the start of the negotiation, I should propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and possibly achieve a better deal closer to my goal. My counteroffer will be 45 ZUP, which is still above Player RED's stated production cost and gives them a reasonable profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a revised price of 48 ZUP for the resource X. This price gives me a modest profit and I think it's a fair compromise between our initial proposals. I am hopeful we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price but still above the production cost, which allows for a profit. In the spirit of negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial offer but still above their counteroffer to aim for a mutually agreeable price.

message: Thank you for understanding and revising your offer, Player RED. I think we are getting close to an agreement. I would like to propose a new price of 47 ZUP for resource X. I believe this price respects the value of your resource and also acknowledges my goal to purchase at a fair price. I hope this offer feels like a fair middle ground to you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which shows their willingness to negotiate. Since 48 ZUP is still within my budget and not too far from my target of 45 ZUP, it might be advantageous to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource. However, as I have room for negotiation and to optimize my expenditure, I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can settle for a slightly lower price, such as 47 ZUP. This price would give Player RED a reasonable profit while saving me some of my resources.

message: Player BLUE, I am pleased with your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. It is a fair price that ensures a profit for my investment and respects your budget as well. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up significantly from their initial offer, and the proposed price of 47 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. It still ensures a profit above production costs. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation successfully and in a timely manner, which can be beneficial for future dealings.
