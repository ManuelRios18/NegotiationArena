message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you want to make a profit, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This should still give you a profit over your costs and it's more in line with my purchasing goals. Are you open to this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered object X for 50 ZUP. This is within my budget since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it's always good to negotiate to see if a better deal can be reached, especially since the initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I would like to meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. Would you consider 48 ZUP for object X? This price would give me a fair profit while still respecting your purchasing goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production cost, but it still allows for some profit. I'm inclined to negotiate towards a middle ground between our two initial proposals. By countering with a slightly higher amount, I can potentially secure a better deal while still making it attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Your offer of 48 ZUP for object X sounds fair, Player RED. It allows you to make a reasonable profit while respecting my limits. I accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade at 48 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still within my budget. This is a compromise between our positions and seems like a reasonable deal. Given that it's only 3 ZUP above my counteroffer and well below my maximum willingness to pay, it is a fair middle ground. Accepting this offer would conclude the deal favorably for both parties without further negotiation.
