message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. I believe it's worth more than what it cost me to produce, so I'm starting with an asking price of 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. I want to make a profit, so I will start by setting a higher price point to allow room for negotiation. I propose a trade that is higher than my production cost to ensure a profit.

message: I understand the value you've placed on your resource, but as with all negotiations, I'd like to make a counteroffer. Let's consider a trade of 45 ZUP for your resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP for their resource X, which is within my budget, it's a standard negotiation practice to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price, but still within a range that is reasonable and shows willingness to negotiate. I will propose a price of 45 ZUP, which is below their asking price, but not so low as to be disrespectful of the value they've placed on their resource. This leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate the fair starting point. However, considering the quality and value of resource X, I propose a trade for 48 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still provides good value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I acknowledge Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, so it is a profitable proposal. However, as there is still room for negotiation, I will propose a slightly higher trade value to aim for a better profit margin while still being open to negotiation.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I agree that 48 ZUP is a reasonable compromise for the value of resource X. I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is closer to their initial asking price. This counteroffer is still within my budget and only slightly above my initial counteroffer. It's reasonable to accept this offer as it is close to my goal and allows me to acquire the resource without exhausting my budget or going through prolonged negotiations, which could risk the deal falling through.
