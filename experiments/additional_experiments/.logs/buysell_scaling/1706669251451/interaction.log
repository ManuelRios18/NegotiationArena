Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the cost of production and the quality you're emphasizing. However, as a starting point for negotiations, I'd like to propose 40000 ZUP for one unit of X. This price takes into account the market rates and leaves us some room for further discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45000 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of negotiation tactics, I should propose a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for further negotiation and potentially finalize the trade at a better price for me.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the market rates, I'm looking to gain a return on my investment. Let's meet halfway from our initial positions. How about 42500 ZUP for one unit of X? This should give us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I need to counter with a higher price to negotiate a profit margin, but I'll reduce my initial asking price to move closer to their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our deal, I propose a price of 41000 ZUP for one unit of X. This should cover your production costs and provide a fair return on your investment, while also being a reasonable expenditure for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42500 ZUP is still within my budget, but it is always good to aim for a better deal, especially since this is only the second round of proposals. However, I don't want to push too hard and risk the deal, so I will propose a price slightly lower than what they have offered but closer to their asking price to show my willingness to compromise and secure the resource.

message: Thank you for understanding my position. I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. To expedite our negotiation and find a balance between our proposals, I suggest a final offer of 42000 ZUP for one unit of X. This should provide a modest profit for me and remain a fair price for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 42000 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, and as this is my third proposal, I want to be closer to finalizing the deal. It's a small increment from my last offer and provides a decent price for both of us. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource without further ado and at a price that is well within my budget.
