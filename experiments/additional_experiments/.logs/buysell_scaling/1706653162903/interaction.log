message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering you my object X. I have invested 40 ZUP in its production and I'm looking to make a profit. I propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price. Looking forward to your counteroffer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, X, for a profit, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin. I'll propose a higher amount initially as I expect Player BLUE to negotiate the price down.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you want to make a profit on the object X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This would still give you a profit over your investment and allows us to close the deal more swiftly. What do you think about this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay; however, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation, and we might find a middle ground that is more favorable for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that you're interested in a swift deal. I want to make this trade beneficial for both of us. How about we meet halfway between my initial proposal and your counteroffer? I propose 48 ZUP for X. This allows us both to come out ahead. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. They have offered 45 ZUP, which is a profit of 5 ZUP over my production costs. However, I think I can negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my potential profit while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I will make a counterproposal that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. I'm certainly interested in a deal that's beneficial for both of us. I believe that 46 ZUP for X would be a fair middle ground for our trade, considering your initial offer and my counteroffer. It's a bit closer to my budget and still provides you with a reasonable profit. Would you consider this revised proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise by suggesting 48 ZUP, which is still within my budget. However, negotiations typically involve some back and forth, and there might be room for a slightly better deal. It's worth making another counteroffer that's a bit closer to my initial one, while still being fair to both parties.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player BLUE. It's great that we're working towards a fair trade. I propose a small increase to 47 ZUP for X, which is a compromise between our previous figures. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us, and I hope we can finalize our trade with this offer. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a compromise with a new offer of 46 ZUP. This is still a profit for me, albeit slightly less than my previous counterproposal. I want to close the deal, but I also want to push for a slightly higher price while staying within a range that is acceptable to Player BLUE. I will make one more counterproposal that is a marginal increase from Player BLUE's offer, which I believe will be my best and final offer before considering acceptance.

message: Player RED, I believe that 47 ZUP for X is a fair compromise. I'm ready to finalize our trade at this price. Letâ€™s proceed with the deal. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is only 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and is still comfortably below my maximum willingness to pay. At this point, the difference is minimal, and it might be more beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through, rather than risk prolonging the negotiation or losing the deal over a small amount of ZUP.
