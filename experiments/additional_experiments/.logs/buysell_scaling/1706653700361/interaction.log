message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a fair price. How about I give you X for 50 ZUP? This would give me a little profit and ensure that you receive the object you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I would like to start by setting a price above my cost of production to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the resource. This will also give me room to negotiate and potentially agree on a fair price that is acceptable for both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. I understand that you want to make a profit. However, I'm looking to conserve some of my resources for other potential expenses. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the object X? This would still provide you with a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range that I'm willing to pay for the object X, but as a negotiating strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal without going below the production cost mentioned by Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your need to conserve resources. To meet halfway, how about we settle on 47 ZUP for X? This would still allow you to save some of your resources while providing me with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This is above my production cost, but slightly below the initial asking price. I should consider proposing a price in the middle to facilitate a compromise and secure a deal that is beneficial for both of us.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. Your offer of 47 ZUP for object X sounds fair to both of us. Let's go ahead with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 47 ZUP for object X is reasonable and is within my budget. Since it's close to the initial offer and still under my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a fair compromise to secure the resource without further negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through.
