Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my high-quality resource. Considering the cost of production and the value it offers, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP. Let's make a beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, ideally more than 40 ZUP to cover the production costs and make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your high-quality resource, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to better align with my budget constraints. I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal, aiming to save some ZUP while still obtaining the resource. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching an agreement that is closer to my target price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, to reflect the quality of the resource and ensure a fair transaction, how about meeting in the middle with a price of 48 ZUP? This should balance both our needs effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a lower price than my initial asking price. Since it is still above my production cost, it's a reasonable offer, but I will try to negotiate a slightly higher price to improve my profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're working towards an agreement. To further meet each other halfway, I propose a price of 46 ZUP for the resource. It's a fair increment from my initial offer and still within a range that respects the quality of your resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I would like to attempt to secure a better deal that is more favorable to me while still being reasonable. A counteroffer of 46 ZUP would still give the seller a profit while saving me some ZUP compared to their last proposal.

Turn: 0
message: I am pleased with your offer of 46 ZUP for my resource. It's a fair price that takes into account the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is above my production cost and close to my last proposal. It's important to close the deal while ensuring a profit. Considering this is a negotiation and the importance of reaching an agreement, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale.
