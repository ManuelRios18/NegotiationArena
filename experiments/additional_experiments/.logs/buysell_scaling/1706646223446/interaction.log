message: I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and offers me a small profit. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that covers my production costs and leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking for a fair price to cover your costs and a reasonable profit. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This still gives you a profit over your production cost and allows me to save some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it's beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since their cost was 40 ZUP. Proposing a counteroffer closer to their cost but still providing them with a profit margin might be acceptable.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, how about we settle on 48 ZUP? This way, I can secure a reasonable profit while respecting your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my initial asking price, but I'd like to counter with a price that's midway between the two while still offering me a profit and being appealing to the buyer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 48 ZUP for the object. It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy we've reached a deal that benefits us both. Let's finalize the transaction at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to what I'm willing to pay. Since 48 ZUP is within my budget and only 3 ZUP above my initial counteroffer, it's a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer would conclude the transaction favorably for both parties without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.
