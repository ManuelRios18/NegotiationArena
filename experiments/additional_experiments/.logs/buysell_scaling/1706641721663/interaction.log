message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X for 45 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open the negotiations. I aim to at least break even on the cost of production, which was 40 ZUP. I might ask for slightly more to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I would like to propose a slight adjustment. How about I give you 40 ZUP for the resource X? I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but as it is the start of the negotiation, I will attempt to get a better deal by proposing a lower price. It's a common strategy in negotiations to counter the first offer. However, I should ensure that my counteroffer is reasonable and not too low, as that might lead to an impasse or Player RED rejecting the deal. I will propose 40 ZUP which gives us room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your point of view, but I would like to propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for the resource X. This would allow me to cover the production costs and account for the effort and time invested.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost. While breaking even ensures that I don't incur a loss, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to account for the opportunity of making a profit, while still keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. The price of 42 ZUP for the resource X seems fair considering your production costs and efforts. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is still within my budget. It is close to my initial counteroffer, and making a deal at this point would secure the resources without exhausting the negotiation process. I believe accepting this offer is in my best interest, as it aligns with my goal and leaves me with some ZUP reserves.
