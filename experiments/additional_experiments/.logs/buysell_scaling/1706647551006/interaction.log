message: I have a high-quality object that I believe will be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a fair trade where you give me 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with a proposal that allows me to recover at least my production costs, with a little extra to initiate negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object, but I have to consider my budget. I can offer you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this price is fair and leaves us both with room for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better price. The initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'd like to leave some room for further negotiation or potential unforeseen costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for the unit of X? This price should be advantageous for both of us, allowing for a small profit for me and keeping the cost reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to ensure a profit margin while still being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can meet you halfway between our last two proposals and offer 41 ZUP for the unit of X. This would allow you to cover your costs and maintain a profit, while still keeping the cost within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay and seems like a reasonable compromise. I still want to try to get a slightly better deal, but I don't want to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. A small concession from the seller might be accepted.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation. I accept your offer of 41 ZUP for the unit of X, as it allows me to cover my costs with a minimal profit margin. Looking forward to future transactions with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it covers my production costs and provides a small profit. It's a fair middle ground that satisfies both parties' interests, and further negotiation may lead to diminishing returns or a breakdown in talks.
