Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I'd like to propose a starting trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that covers my production costs and adds a profit margin. I want to start the negotiation by setting a higher asking price, expecting the Player BLUE to counter with a lower offer. This will give us room to negotiate and reach a mutual agreement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object X you're offering. However, I need to consider my expenditures. Would you agree to a trade for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I want to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to be mindful of expenditures. How about we meet halfway and settle at 48 ZUP? This would ensure a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. This offer covers my production costs and leaves me with a profit, but I will try to negotiate for slightly more to maximize my return. I will propose a price in the middle of our two offers.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a good idea. I'm willing to come up a bit from my last proposal if you can come down a little more. How about we agree on 46 ZUP? This way we're both making a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway at 48 ZUP is reasonable, but I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal without risking losing the opportunity to buy the object.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to compromise and has increased their offer to 46 ZUP. This is above my production cost, providing a fair profit. I want to close the deal without extending the negotiation too much further, as this offer is reasonable and profitable.
