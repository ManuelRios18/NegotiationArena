message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your quick response and understanding of the costs. However, to make this transaction worthwhile for me, I would need to gain some profit. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 425 ZUP. This should cover my costs and provide a small return on the investment. I hope this meets your valuation as well.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer covers my production costs, it does not provide any profit. However, it's a starting point for negotiation. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above the cost to aim for a profit margin.

player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 425 ZUP is closer to the initial proposal and still within my willingness to pay.

It's a fair middle ground that both recognizes the seller's need for profit and my own resource conservation.
