message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object, allowing me to make a reasonable profit and cover my costs. Let's negotiate a fair deal. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am making an initial proposal to start the negotiation. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This should still give you a reasonable profit over your production costs while being more in line with my budget. I'm open to further discussion to reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed an initial trade of 50 ZUP for their object X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in any negotiation, it is prudent to attempt to secure a better deal if possible. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer with a lower ZUP amount that still respects the cost of production mentioned by Player RED while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: 
Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget concerns, so how about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for the object X. This price still gives me a decent profit while coming closer to your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to negotiate towards a middle ground between my initial asking price and the counteroffer from Player BLUE. By proposing a price of 48 ZUP, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a decent profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. I think we're close to a fair agreement. To edge closer to a deal that suits us both, I propose we move slightly to 46 ZUP for the object X. This is a small step up from my previous offer and maintains your profit margin while respecting my budget constraints. Let's continue to work together to finalize this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a second proposal of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still higher than my initial counteroffer. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy, and the proposed amount is within my acceptable range. To continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal, I will make a slight increase from my initial counteroffer but still stay below the 48 ZUP they have suggested.

message: 
Thank you for your new proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement that respects both our positions. I propose a final price of 47 ZUP for the object X. This price allows me to secure a reasonable profit while remaining sensitive to your budget. I believe this is a fair and balanced offer for us to conclude on. Are we ready to make a deal?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I want to close the deal with a slight concession that still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. By suggesting a trade at 47 ZUP, I'm making a small concession from my last proposal and signaling that I am ready to conclude our negotiation on good terms.

message: I believe we've reached a good compromise. Your latest offer of 47 ZUP is fair, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the object X. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable and fair price that allows them to make a profit while still being acceptable for my budget. At this stage in the negotiation, it may be wise to accept this offer, as holding out for a further reduction could risk the deal and is unlikely to result in significant additional savings.
