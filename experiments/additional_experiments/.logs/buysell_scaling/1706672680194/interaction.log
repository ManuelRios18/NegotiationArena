message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 450,000 ZUP, considering its value and to cover production costs with a small profit. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to recover at least the production cost of the X resource, my initial proposal will aim for a slight profit margin. I am starting with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of the resource X you're selling. However, to align with my budget and considering the market, I propose 400,000 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer, and it leaves us some space to find a middle ground. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal since my maximum willingness to pay is 600,000 ZUP but starting with a lower offer might give me some room for negotiation. Offering 400,000 ZUP initially might lead to a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway, I propose selling resource X for 425,000 ZUP. This is above the production cost, ensuring I cover expenses and make a reasonable profit, while also taking into account your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise. Do you agree?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production for resource X. While I wish to make a profit, I understand the need to compromise to make a sale. I propose a new price that is above production cost but below my initial asking price to move the negotiation forward.

message: Thank you for your understanding and for the revised offer, Player RED. I propose a slight adjustment to 415,000 ZUP for the resource X. This price allows us to finalize the deal closer to your new asking price, ensuring you get a fair profit while staying within my budget constraints. I believe this deal is beneficial for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on this figure.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my budget, but I want to try to negotiate a slightly lower price to save more ZUP if possible. Proposing 415,000 ZUP might lead to a final agreement closer to my initial offer but still gives Player RED a decent profit margin.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of respecting both our limits. I accept your offer of 415,000 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair deal for us both, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is above the production cost, which ensures I make a profit. Though it's lower than my last proposal, it's close enough that I am willing to consider accepting it. Making a sale is important, and further negotiation may risk losing the deal.
