However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate to see if I could get the resource for a lower price, closer to my target of spending less. I will propose a lower amount, but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for your offer, Player RED.
