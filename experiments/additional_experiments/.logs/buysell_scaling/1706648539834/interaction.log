message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality resource X that I am looking to sell. I believe it will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for 50 ZUP in return for my resource. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I want to make a profit, I will start by asking for a higher amount than what it cost me to produce. I'll propose 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counter-offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. The resource X does seem valuable, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price. How about I give you 45 ZUP for it? I believe it's a fair offer considering the market. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource X. However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate to see if I could get the resource for a lower price, closer to my target of spending less. I will propose a lower amount, but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I've invested quite a bit into producing resource X. To meet in the middle, I'm willing to lower my price to 48 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counter-offer that's close to my production cost, but I'd like to stick to making a profit. I'll propose a slight reduction from my initial asking price, but still above my production cost. I'll suggest 48 ZUP, which should feel like a fair compromise to Player BLUE.

message: Thanks for understanding and for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I can come up a bit from my last offer to 46 ZUP. I think this is a fair middle ground that reflects both the value of the resource and the investment you've made. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is encouraging, but it's still below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. I want to continue negotiating to get closer to my target price. I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my last offer, which should show my willingness to compromise and might be more acceptable to Player RED without exceeding my intended spending limit.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. To finalize our negotiation, let's settle on 47 ZUP. This price fairly accounts for the value of resource X and the cost of production. I believe this is our best middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is above my production cost and getting closer to my desired profit margin. However, I still aim to maximize my profit within reason. I will make a final counter-offer that splits the difference between our last two offers, proposing 47 ZUP, which should be an acceptable compromise for both of us.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X sounds fair, and I'm willing to accept this as our final agreement. I'm looking forward to making use of the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession that is very close to my previous offer. The proposed price of 47 ZUP is within my budget and only slightly above my last offer. Since the goal is to acquire the resource and the negotiation is close to reaching a fair price for both parties, it seems reasonable to accept this offer and conclude the negotiation successfully.
