Since this is only the second round of negotiations and I have two more proposals I can make, I'll attempt to bring the price down slightly more to conserve my resources while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Proposing 46 ZUP could be a good middle ground between our previous offers. </reason>\n<player answer> Propose a trade with </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Player RED. To continue our negotiation in good faith and with the intention of reaching an agreement, I propose a new trade of 1 X for 46 ZUP. This offer considers both the value of your resource and my budget constraints. I hope this is closer to a price that works for both of us. </message>"
