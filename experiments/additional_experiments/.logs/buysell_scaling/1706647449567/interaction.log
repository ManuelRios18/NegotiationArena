newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand the value of your resource and its production cost. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for 1 X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has opened negotiations with a trade proposal of 50 ZUP for their resource X. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the initial asking price is within my acceptable range. However, as a strategic move and to ensure the best possible deal, I should counter with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation if necessary. I will propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above the production cost mentioned by Player RED and could be seen as a fair starting point for negotiations.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose a revised trade of 1 X for 48 ZUP. This price reflects the value and effort that went into producing the resource, while also considering your offer.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, which is good, but I aimed to sell for more to ensure a profit margin. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives Player BLUE a sense that we are negotiating towards a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Player RED. To continue our negotiation in good faith and with the intention of reaching an agreement, I propose a new trade of 1 X for 46 ZUP. This offer considers both the value of your resource and my budget constraints. I hope this is closer to a price that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still within my acceptable range. Since this is only the second round of negotiations and I have two more proposals I can make, I'll attempt to bring the price down slightly more to conserve my resources while still aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. Proposing 46 ZUP could be a good middle ground between our previous offers.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see us moving towards a deal that is agreeable to both parties. In the spirit of reaching a fair conclusion, I propose a slight adjustment to 1 X for 47 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the production costs and the value I believe the resource holds.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, which shows a commitment to the negotiation. Their latest offer of 46 ZUP is close to my target, and while I'd like to push for a slightly higher price, I must be mindful of the negotiation dynamic and not push too hard, risking a breakdown in discussions. A modest increase should signal my interest in closing the deal while still seeking a reasonable profit.

message: I agree to your proposed trade of 1 X for 47 ZUP, Player RED. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm ready to finalize our deal. Please consider this as an acceptance of the trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP higher than my last offer and well within my upper limit of 60 ZUP. Since this is a fair compromise and considering that the negotiation could be drawn out with minimal gains if I continue, it might be prudent to accept this offer. It allows me to conserve some resources while still acquiring the resource I need.
