message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I propose a trade for 4500 ZUP. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to see how Player BLUE values the resource and to give myself some negotiating room.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I acknowledge the value of the resource X, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource X, but as a negotiating strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I believe we're getting close to a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 4350 ZUP for the resource X? I think this reflects its value and the effort put into producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs, which is a good sign. However, I would like to negotiate for a price closer to my initial asking price. I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference between our two proposals, aiming for a fair trade that is profitable for me.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I think 4350 ZUP is a fair price for resource X and reflects the quality of the resource well. I am happy to accept this offer and look forward to concluding our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to their initial proposal. Since the counteroffer is still within my budget and only slightly above my initial counteroffer, it is a fair middle ground. I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through and to maintain good trading relations for potential future trades.
