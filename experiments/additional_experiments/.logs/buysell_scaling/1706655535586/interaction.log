message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 45 ZUP, allowing me to recover my costs and gain a small profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Starting the game with an initial proposal that aims to cover the production costs of the resource X and potentially get a small profit. This would also help gauge the willingness to pay from Player BLUE.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate you sharing your costs and your initial offer. I would like to make a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the object X. This would still give you a profit while also being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player REDâ€™s initial proposal is reasonable and is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource X. However, as a good trading practice, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal for myself while still offering Player RED a profit over their cost.
