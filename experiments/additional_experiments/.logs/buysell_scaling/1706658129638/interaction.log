Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe its value is well worth the 50 ZUP I am asking for, considering its quality and utility.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As player Red, my objective is to sell the object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a price that allows me to make a profit. I will thus propose a trade with a price higher than 40 ZUP to open negotiations and see how player Blue responds.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on the object X, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This price takes into account the cost of production you mentioned and also leaves room for some profit for you, while staying within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, since it is a negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a lower price to see if there is room for a discount, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED. I will propose 45 ZUP which gives me some savings while respecting the cost Player RED has indicated.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have considered your offer of 45 ZUP and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for object X? This price would still provide you with a valuable acquisition while allowing me a fair profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate player Blue's counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which acknowledges the production cost and offers some profit. However, I'd like to propose a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still remaining within a range that might be acceptable for player Blue. I'll suggest a compromise between the initial asking price and their counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP sounds fair and I am happy to agree to this price. It allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize the trade at 48 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their original asking price. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to a satisfactory deal for both parties. Accepting this offer would secure the object for me at a price within my range, and also allow Player RED to make a profit. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this counteroffer.
