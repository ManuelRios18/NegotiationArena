Turn: 0
message: I'm offering 1 unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and a modest profit. Let's start the discussion at 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my costs and possibly make a profit. I will start with a slightly higher asking price with the expectation that Player BLUE may want to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit, but I'd like to propose a trade at 45 ZUP. This should give you a modest profit while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's always good to try and negotiate a better deal, especially since there might be room for Player RED to still make a profit at a slightly lower price. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to the middle of their cost and my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. I would like to propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP, which gives me a bit more profit while respecting your budget. Let's find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production costs and provides a profit, albeit smaller than initially proposed. Since we are early in the negotiation and I wish to maximize profit without risking the deal, I will counter with a slightly higher price, aiming to meet in the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the middle ground of 48 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, though it is closer to the upper limit of what I'm willing to pay. Since it's beneficial to secure the resources for the game and maintain good trade relations, and this price still allows me to acquire the resource under my maximum willingness to pay, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
