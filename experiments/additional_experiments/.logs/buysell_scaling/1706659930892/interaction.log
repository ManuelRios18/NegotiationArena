message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a small profit. Would you be willing to purchase it for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I am setting a price slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement that covers my costs and provides a profit.
proposal count: 1

message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you are looking for a profit. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the unit of resource X. This would still give you a profit above your production cost and would be more in line with my budget. What do you think about this proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. However, as it's the beginning of the negotiation, I believe I can propose a slightly lower price to see if there's any flexibility and potentially save some resources. I will propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP which is above their cost of production and allows for a profit.
