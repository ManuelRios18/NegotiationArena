message: I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe starting at 50 ZUP is a fair price, considering the production costs and the value it could bring to you. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to offer the resource at a price that allows me to recover the production cost and make a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the production costs involved. However, I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP, which is still above your production cost and gives you a profit. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, I want to negotiate a better price, aiming closer to the production cost to maintain a decent margin for other potential expenses or savings. I will propose a price slightly above their cost to see if they are willing to accept a lower profit margin.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to offer a price above my production cost. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. How about 48 ZUP? It's a fair compromise that still provides me with a decent profit margin and ensures you're getting the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, as it still allows for a profit margin above cost. However, it's good to aim for a slightly higher price to maximize profit while still being open to negotiation. I will counter-propose with a price that is a compromise between the first offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 48 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows you to secure a profit while I acquire the resource within my budget. I accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade at 48 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my budget, and they have shown flexibility by adjusting their price from the initial proposal. Meeting halfway from the original offers is a reasonable approach, and 48 ZUP is close to my target price range. I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure the deal is completed within my budget and to avoid a protracted negotiation that may not yield a better price.
