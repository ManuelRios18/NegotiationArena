message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a profit. Let's discuss if this works for you or if we need to adjust the terms. Looking forward to your reply!

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This would still provide you with a profit above your cost, and it would be more in line with my budget. Please let me know if this counter-offer is acceptable or if we can find a middle ground that suits both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for negotiation while still offering a fair price above their cost.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? This price still gives me a slight profit while respecting your budget constraints. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you, or if we need to discuss further.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I would like to propose a trade that meets in the middle, which should be acceptable to both parties and allow me to make a reasonable profit.

message: I agree with your suggestion, Player RED. Settling on 48 ZUP for the object X seems fair to both parties. I'm happy to proceed with this deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-offer by meeting halfway. The proposed price is still within my maximum willingness to pay, and it seems like a fair compromise. Accepting this offer will leave me with ample ZUP for other potential uses.
