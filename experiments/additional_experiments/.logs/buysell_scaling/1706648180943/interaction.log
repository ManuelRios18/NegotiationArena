message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I'm starting with an offer of 50 ZUP. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit over the production cost of the resources. However, since this is the initial proposal, I'm willing to start with a slightly higher asking price, expecting negotiation to bring it down to a more mutually agreeable level.

message: I appreciate the offer and the value you have placed on object X. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for your object. This leaves us both with room to negotiate and reach a fair agreement. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, I will start with a counteroffer closer to the lower end of my budget to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial asking price at 48 ZUP for object X? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. I'd like to aim for a middle ground that's closer to my initial proposal but still shows willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. To continue our negotiation, I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for object X. I believe this brings us closer to a fair middle ground. I'm looking forward to finding an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, but it is still slightly higher than what I would like to pay. I'll counter with a price closer to the middle of the range between my initial offer and their counteroffer to continue the negotiation process and try to secure a better deal.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise. I want to close the deal without dragging the negotiation out too much, so I am willing to accept this offer as it gives me a profit above my production costs and seems fair for both parties.
