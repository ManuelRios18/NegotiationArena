message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be quite valuable to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my costs and a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit while also being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost.

message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object. This would allow us both to make a fair trade, considering the costs and the value of the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for the object, I believe that there is room for negotiation. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, starting with a lower counteroffer will give me some room to negotiate further if necessary. Thus, I will propose a trade at a lower ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to accept or negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand where you're coming from, and I'd like to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object? This price is a compromise between both our positions, and I believe it's a fair deal that benefits us both. Are you willing to agree to this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but slightly below the initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'll propose a compromise that is halfway between my initial asking price and their offer. This should be fair to both parties and still allows me to make a profit.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to 47 ZUP for the object. I think this price is very close to a fair middle ground for us both. If this works for you, I believe we could finalize this deal. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I believe I can still attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal, but I should not push too far as we are nearing a reasonable price. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I continue the negotiation process while still showing willingness to close the deal soon.

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us. Let's proceed with finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a slightly lower price than my last offer. Since the proposed price is still above my production costs and the negotiation is moving in small increments, it makes sense to accept this offer to ensure a sale and secure a profit. Continuing to negotiate might risk the deal, and the difference is negligible.
