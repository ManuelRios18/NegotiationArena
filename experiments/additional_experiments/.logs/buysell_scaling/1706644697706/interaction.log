Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality item that I'm sure you will find valuable. Considering the costs I've incurred and its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even but would ideally like to make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value of the item. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to start with. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation and it is always wise to try and get a better deal, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially save some resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand we are trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 47 ZUP? This would give me a slight profit margin while still giving you a fair price for the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, but since my goal is to make a profit, I will counter with a price above my production cost but lower than my initial asking price to facilitate a potential deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my proposal. I believe we are close to a deal. I would like to propose 46 ZUP as a compromise that leans towards your suggested price while still providing me with some savings.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still under my maximum willingness to pay. This is a good sign that we are converging towards an agreement. However, I might try for one more round of negotiation to see if I can get a slightly better deal without pushing too hard, as the current offer is already reasonable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 46 ZUP is acceptable, and I am happy to proceed with this trade. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that is above my production cost, which allows for a small profit. Considering the negotiation process and the desire to close the deal, it may be advantageous to accept this offer.
