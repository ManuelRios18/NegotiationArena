Turn: 0
message: I have a quality object X to offer, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose a price of 50 ZUP, considering the value and production cost. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with an opening proposal that's slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the production cost and the value of the object. I am interested in making a fair trade. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This respects the production cost you've mentioned and leaves us room to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay for the object X. However, as a strategic move to ensure the best deal for myself, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the production cost mentioned by Player RED, leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position. I would like to counter with an offer of 46 ZUP. This is a bit more balanced between your cost of production and my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is very close to their initial asking price and is just below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a better deal than the first offer, but I will attempt to negotiate it down slightly more to preserve my resources while still arriving at a fair deal for both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. Let's meet halfway between your offer and mine. How about we finalize this deal at 47 ZUP? It's a fair middle ground that gives me a slight profit while respecting your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved up from their initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise. I'll attempt a final proposal that meets in the middle of our last offers, still ensuring a profit for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the price of 47 ZUP. It's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 47 ZUP is reasonable and very close to my last counteroffer. It is also within my budget and allows for a small profit for Player RED. Since this negotiation is about finding a fair price for both parties, and the offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a good point to agree on the deal.
