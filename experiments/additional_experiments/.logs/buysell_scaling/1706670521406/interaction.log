message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource (X) that cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a reasonable profit. I propose a trade where you give me 450000 ZUP for this resource. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the costs and the value of the resource. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) at a price that at least covers my production costs, which are 400000 ZUP. My initial proposal will be slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I can make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I acknowledge the quality of your resource and your production costs. However, I'd like to propose a revised offer of 425000 ZUP for the resource. This should still provide a sizable profit margin for you while keeping the purchase within a reasonable range for me. Let's continue the discussion and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, there is room to negotiate for a better deal since my maximum willingness to pay is higher than the asking price. I will start with a lower counteroffer to find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective and would like to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 435000 ZUP for the resource? This price gives me a modest profit while respecting the value you're looking for. I'm hopeful we can agree on this number and make a fair deal for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I see that Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 425000 ZUP for the resource. This is above my production cost, ensuring a profit. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my returns while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE. A compromise between our initial proposals could be a good middle ground.
