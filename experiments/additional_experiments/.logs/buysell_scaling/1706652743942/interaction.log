Turn: 0
message: I have an object X available for trade. Considering the production costs and a fair profit margin, I propose a trade for 45 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object X, which is 40 ZUP. Since this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a slight profit margin while leaving room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to counter with a proposal of 40 ZUP for the object X. I believe this offers a fair compromise while allowing for further negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay, but as it's the starting point of the negotiation, it's standard practice to propose a counteroffer with a lower price to find a mutually agreeable middle ground. Thus, I'll propose a trade at 40 ZUP, which is below the initial asking price but still within a reasonable range considering my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your position. However, to make this trade worthwhile for me, I need to include a small profit. I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP. This should cover my production costs and give me a minimal return on my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost but doesn't provide any profit. While I'm willing to negotiate, I would like to propose a trade that includes a small profit to justify the sale. I will come down slightly from my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility and understand the importance of your profit. The price of 42 ZUP seems reasonable, and I'm willing to accept this trade. Let's proceed with the deal at 42 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering the price from 45 ZUP to 42 ZUP. This is closer to my initial counteroffer, and it's also below the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resources. Since the objective is to buy the resources at the lowest possible price while still achieving a deal, I will accept this trade as it is a fair price and within my budget.
