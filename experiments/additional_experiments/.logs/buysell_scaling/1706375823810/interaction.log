Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe that this object has significant value, taking into account the production cost and its quality. I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP to open the discussion.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs of the object and also gain a profit. As the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will propose a higher value to start the negotiation with the expectation that there might be some bargaining involved.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality and value of the object, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to reflect my current market assessment and budget constraints. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but starting with a counteroffer below that could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for me. I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. However, considering the costs and the inherent value of the object, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP, which I believe is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To move towards a compromise and still ensure a profit, I will counter with a slightly reduced price, yet still above my production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position. I believe that 46 ZUP is a fair value that respects both our stances. It's a modest increase from my initial counteroffer and reflects my sincere intention to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. Considering this is only the second round of proposals, I have room to negotiate. I will counter with a slightly lower offer that is closer to my initial counteroffer but still shows willingness to move towards Player RED's asking price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair value for both of us. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is closer to my counteroffer, and it allows for a profit margin that is satisfactory. It's a good compromise between recovering costs and making a profit while also considering the buyer's position.
