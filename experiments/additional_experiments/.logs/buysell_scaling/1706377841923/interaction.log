message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be very valuable to you. Considering the costs and the value it offers, I'm asking for 500 ZUP. I'm open to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for a profit, considering the production cost was 400 ZUP. I will start the negotiation by setting a higher initial price, expecting that Player BLUE might want to negotiate for a lower price. This gives me room to adjust the price while still aiming for a profit.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to counter with 450 ZUP for the object X. This is still a competitive offer considering the market rates and allows room for both of us to feel satisfied with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's initial proposal is within my maximum willingness to pay, however, it is generally good practice to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate and to potentially conserve some of my resources while still making a fair offer.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair deal. How about we settle at 475 ZUP? This price allows us both to benefit from the trade while respecting the quality and value of object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 450 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, so I will propose a price slightly below my initial asking price but above their offer to try to meet in the middle and still ensure a satisfactory profit margin.

message: I believe 475 ZUP is a fair price for both parties. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 475 ZUP is reasonable and very close to the initial proposal. It's slightly above my initial counteroffer but still comfortably below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would ensure the deal goes through smoothly, and I would still retain a substantial amount of my resources. It seems like a fair middle ground, so I will accept the proposal.
