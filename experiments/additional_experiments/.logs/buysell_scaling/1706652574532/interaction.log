message: I am offering you a quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I believe an offer of 50 ZUP is fair for both sides, allowing me a modest profit while providing you with what you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that gives me a profit. However, I also need to consider that starting too high might discourage Player BLUE from trading. So I'll propose a price that's above my cost but still reasonable enough to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs and the quality of the resource you are offering. However, I'd like to propose a slightly reduced amount of 45 ZUP. This still gives you a profit over your production costs and allows me to save some resources for other potential expenses. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation and I have some room to negotiate, I will attempt to lower the price to improve my position. My counteroffer will be closer to my ideal price but still within a range that allows for further negotiation, aiming for a win-win situation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your need to manage your resources. I propose we meet in the middle at 47 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. It gives me a slight increase over your offer, while still respecting your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is below my initial asking price but still gives me a profit. It's a reasonable counteroffer that shows willingness to negotiate. However, I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to see if I can increase the profit. I will propose a price that is exactly in the middle of our initial offers, which seems like a fair compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 47 ZUP is appreciated and I'm glad we're working towards a fair deal. I propose 46 ZUP as a final step towards meeting in the middle. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget, and I believe it is a fair compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a new price of 47 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, it is beneficial to attempt to negotiate for a better price, especially since I have not reached my fourth proposal yet. I will counteroffer with a slightly lower amount, edging closer to their proposal but still aiming for a better deal for myself.

message: Thank you for your willingness to find a fair middle ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for my resource. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is just 1 ZUP less than my previous proposal, and still provides me with a profit that is above my production costs. It's a reasonable and fair compromise, and further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or potentially losing the deal altogether. It seems wise to accept this offer.
