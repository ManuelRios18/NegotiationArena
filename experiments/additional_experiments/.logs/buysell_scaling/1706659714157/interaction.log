message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I would like to propose a trade where I give you X: 1 and you give me ZUP: 50. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for me, but I am open to discussion. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP to recover at least my production costs. I will begin by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I understand the need for profit, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer takes into account both your production costs and a fair profit margin, while also respecting my budget. I believe this can be a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but since there is room for negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my resources while still making an offer that should be attractive to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of my production costs and the need for a profit. I would like to propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This meets us halfway between our two proposals and should reflect a fair trade for both sides. I hope this is acceptable to you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, which is close to my production cost. I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure a better profit margin while also moving towards an agreement.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a great approach, and to continue in that spirit, I propose offering 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit closer to your last proposal and still ensures a reasonable profit for you. I hope we can agree on this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal is still slightly above the midpoint of our initial offers but below my maximum willingness to pay. I can afford to increase my offer slightly to reach an agreement that is closer to my target price while showing willingness to compromise.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see that we are converging towards a fair agreement. I would like to propose 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is just a slight increase from your offer and ensures a reasonable profit for me as the seller. I am hopeful that this will be a satisfactory price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to a price that still allows for a profit on my end. As this is my third proposal, I should aim for a final price that I would be comfortable with, without having too many more back-and-forths.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X is acceptable to me. I'm glad we could find a price that works for both of us. I accept this trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is only 1 ZUP away from my last offer. This is a reasonable compromise and is well within my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties, and I would still be purchasing the resource at a price that is satisfactory to me.
