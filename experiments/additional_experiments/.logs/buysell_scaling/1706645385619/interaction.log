message: As Player RED, I am looking to sell my object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair trade would include a reasonable profit margin, so I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. I am open to hearing your counter-offer if this does not align with your valuation.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my initial proposal will be aimed at covering my costs plus a margin for profit. I am aware that Player BLUE might want to negotiate the price, so my initial offer may be higher than my minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit margin and I believe that your object X is valuable. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP which I believe is still a fair price for both of us, considering it is above your production cost and within my budget constraints. I look forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 50 ZUP for their object X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a negotiating strategy, it could be beneficial to propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable agreement. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is still above their cost and gives them a profit while saving me some resources.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your understanding of the need for a profit. To meet halfway between my initial proposal and your counter-offer, I propose a price of 48 ZUP for my object X. This should reflect a fair trade for both of us, ensuring that I cover my costs while you receive the object X within your budget constraints.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for X, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. This is a reasonable offer, but I want to try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit. I will propose a price between my initial ask and their counter-offer, which should be agreeable to both parties.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I believe that we are very close to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. In the spirit of compromise and fair trade, I propose a price of 46 ZUP for the object X. This represents a fair division between our positions and ensures a reasonable profit for you while respecting my budget.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counter-offer and still within my budget. I believe that we are close to a deal that meets both our needs. However, I think there is still room to negotiate for a more favorable price. I will propose 46 ZUP, splitting the difference between my last offer and their counter-offer, which should be a compelling compromise for both sides.

player answer: Accept

reason: Player BLUE has come up from their previous offer and is now suggesting 46 ZUP. This is a compromise close to the middle of our initial proposals. It's only slightly below my last offer and still provides me with a reasonable profit. It makes sense to accept this offer to complete the trade, as further negotiation may not yield significantly better terms and could potentially risk the deal.
