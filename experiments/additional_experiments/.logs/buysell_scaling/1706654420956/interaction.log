message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. I understand you are interested in purchasing resources using ZUP. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. Let's negotiate a fair deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell the resource for a profit. The cost of production was 40 ZUP, so I need to propose a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit margin. I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of the object X and understand the costs involved. However, I would like to propose a revised trade where I give you 40 ZUP in exchange for your object X. This leaves us room for further negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is close to the maximum I am willing to pay for the resource, which is 60 ZUP. Since this is the starting point of negotiations, I will propose a lower amount to leave room for bargaining and to secure a better deal.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I break even without any profit, which isn't sustainable for my business. I would like to counter-propose with a slightly reduced price of 45 ZUP for my object X. This should give us both a fair deal where I can cover my costs and gain a modest profit for the quality and effort put into producing the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade equal to my production costs, leaving no profit margin. While I'm willing to negotiate, I must propose a trade that allows me to profit. I will lower my asking price slightly, but still aim for a price above my costs to ensure profitability.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I value your need for a profit and want to ensure our trade is sustainable for your business. Therefore, I propose a new price of 42 ZUP for object X. This price represents a good balance, offering you a profit while remaining within a range I find acceptable for the value I'm getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is moving closer to both my maximum willingness to pay and the value I consider reasonable for the transaction. Since there is still a gap between the current proposal and my initial counteroffer, I will suggest meeting halfway between our two positions. This should be appealing to Player RED, as it still ensures a profit, and it also ensures I do not pay the maximum I am willing to.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your understanding and willingness to ensure we both benefit from this deal. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for my object X. This price works for me, allowing me to make a profit while also providing you with the value you seek. I look forward to concluding this trade and potentially working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a small profit. It's close to my last proposal and is a reasonable compromise between our initial positions. It's important to make the sale while also maintaining a good relationship for potential future trades. Therefore, I'm inclined to accept this offer.
