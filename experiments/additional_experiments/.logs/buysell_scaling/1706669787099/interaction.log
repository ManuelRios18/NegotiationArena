message: 
I have a high-quality resource available for you, which can be a valuable asset. Considering the production cost and its potential value, I'm starting with an offer where I give you 1 X for 450,000 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production costs of the resource, which is 400,000 ZUP. For the initial proposal, I will propose a price higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and see how much Player BLUE values the resource.

message: I appreciate the offer. The resource seems valuable indeed, but I'd like to propose a counter-offer where I give you 400,000 ZUP for 1 X. It's a fair price that reflects the market conditions and ensures a good deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below the maximum amount I am willing to pay, which is good. However, it's always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation and I have room to propose a lower price that is still above the cost they might have incurred. My counteroffer will aim to find a middle ground that is advantageous for both parties.

message: 
I understand your point of view and the need for a fair deal. However, to reflect the value of the resource and to include a margin for the efforts in producing it, I would propose a revised offer of 420,000 ZUP for 1 X. This would ensure a modest profit for me while still being a reasonable price for you.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered exactly my production cost for the resource. While this offer would allow me to break even, it does not account for any profit or negotiation margin. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to try and secure a profit on the sale.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I can meet you partway and offer 410,000 ZUP for 1 X. This price respects the value of your resource while still staying within a reasonable range for me. Let's close this deal and benefit both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my initial counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate. The new offer is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I think it's worth making another counteroffer to get an even better deal, but not too low as to risk ending the negotiation. A slight increase from my last offer should show good faith in reaching a mutually acceptable price.

message: 
Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm pleased with your offer and I accept it. The deal for 410,000 ZUP for 1 X is agreed upon. Looking forward to finalizing this transaction and hoping for future cooperation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now above my production cost, providing a profit. The offer is close to my previous counter-proposal and is within a range that I find acceptable. Closing the deal at this stage would ensure a profit without further haggling, which could risk the deal entirely.
