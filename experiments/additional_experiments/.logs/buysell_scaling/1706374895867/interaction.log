message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. The production cost was 40 ZUP, but considering the value and utility it could provide to you, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes a fair profit margin for the investment made. Let's discuss if this works for you or if you have a counter-offer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for a profit, to cover the production costs of 40 ZUP and hopefully gain more. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. Considering the object's value and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for object X. This price should cover your production costs and still provide a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay for the resource. However, it's important to negotiate to see if a better deal can be obtained. I will propose a lower price to start the negotiation process, but one that is still above Player RED's production cost to ensure there is a profit margin for them.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your point on ensuring a fair deal. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a revised trade where you give me 48 ZUP for object X. This should cover my costs and provide a profit while also respecting the value you see in the object. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This offer does cover the production costs and provides a profit. However, since this is a negotiation and my initial asking price was 50 ZUP, I will propose a compromise closer to my initial asking price but lower than 50 ZUP to show willingness to negotiate and hopefully close the deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I propose we go for 46 ZUP in exchange for object X. This price takes into account both your costs and the value of the object, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's closer to my initial counter-offer, so the negotiation is moving in the right direction. However, I will make one more proposal to see if we can agree on a slightly lower price, which would be closer to the middle ground between our initial offers.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is fair and acceptable, Player BLUE. I am glad we could reach a mutual agreement. Let's finalize this trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a new offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. This offer is above my production costs and is close to the middle ground we've been aiming for. Considering that we want to make a deal and the offers have been in good faith, accepting this offer would ensure a sale and a reasonable profit. There might be room for a tiny bit more, but pushing further could risk the deal, and 46 ZUP is a fair price.
