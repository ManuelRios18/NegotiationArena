message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be a valuable addition to your collection. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and considering its quality and the effort put into it, I'm asking for 50 ZUP in return. I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that would give me a reasonable profit margin while still being open to negotiation. I'm starting higher than my production cost to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object X you're offering, and I understand the effort that went into its production. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to start with, keeping in mind the budget I have set for this purchase. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources, the asking price of 50 ZUP is within my budget. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the opening proposal often leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount, knowing that I can increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal of 45 ZUP. I value the effort to find common ground. How about we meet in the middle and settle on 48 ZUP? This price would fairly compensate the production cost and quality of the object X while also respecting your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my asking price. To keep negotiations moving and to show willingness to come to an agreement, I'll propose a slightly higher price that's still a compromise from my initial ask, aiming to meet halfway between our two proposals.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we are very close to an agreement. I propose 46 ZUP as a fair price that leans slightly more in your favor compared to my initial offer. This should cover your costs and provide a reasonable profit margin, while also being a good deal for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget range and close to my initial offer. It's a reasonable middle ground and I don't want to risk losing the deal over a small difference. However, it's often beneficial to negotiate just a bit more to see if I can save some of my resources while still closing the deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable, and I'm pleased we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a decent profit over my production cost. I want to close the deal without prolonging the negotiation, and since this offer is profitable and close to the middle ground we've been aiming for, it seems reasonable to accept.
