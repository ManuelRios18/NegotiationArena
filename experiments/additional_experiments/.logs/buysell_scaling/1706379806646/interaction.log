message: I'm offering the resource for 4500 ZUP, which includes the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade by proposing a starting price that would allow me to recover the production costs and potentially make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. I'm looking to make a fair deal that works for both of us. How about we settle on 4200 ZUP for the resource? This price would cover your costs and still provide a profit while being within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is a good starting point for negotiation. However, as in any negotiation, it could be beneficial to counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there is room for an even better deal, while still keeping the counteroffer within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair deal. To meet in the middle, I propose we settle on 4350 ZUP for the resource. This splits the difference between our initial figures and should be acceptable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production cost and provides a profit, but I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my returns. I propose meeting halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise. I agree that 4350 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 4350 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a good sign of cooperation and willingness to come to an agreement. Considering the initial offer and this new proposal, it might be a good opportunity to close the deal at a price that is below my maximum budget and is agreeable to both parties.
