message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the costs and the value of the resource. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit over the production cost, but I'll leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the cost of production you've incurred, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for one unit of X as a counteroffer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable trade for me.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for one unit of X? This price takes into consideration the production costs and still provides a reasonable profit margin for me. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but slightly lower than my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate and meet halfway to secure a deal that is beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate the need for a fair profit margin. However, I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for one unit of X, balancing both our interests and edging closer to an agreeable price for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay but is getting close to the upper limit. I'd like to negotiate a slightly better deal while still keeping the conversation open and moving towards an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the new proposal. I'm glad to see we're aligning on the value of X. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP. This price fairly reflects the production cost and the value it brings. Looking forward to your response, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is closer to my initial proposal. Since I want to make a sale and still obtain a decent profit, I am inclined to accept this offer, but I will attempt one final negotiation to see if I can secure a slightly higher price while showing willingness to close the deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your assessment, and I'm happy to finalize the deal at 47 ZUP for one unit of X. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I'm ready to close the deal at this agreed price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 47 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay and seems fair given the previous proposals. I believe it is in my interest to accept this offer to secure the resource without further prolongation of the negotiation, which could risk no agreement being reached.
