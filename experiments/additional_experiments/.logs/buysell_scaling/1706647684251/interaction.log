Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my high-quality resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a slightly higher price to ensure a good deal for both of us. How does 45 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, which is X, for ZUP and at least break even on my production costs. I am starting the bidding at a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the need for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose 40 ZUP for the resource, considering the market conditions and to ensure that we are both getting a good deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 45 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, it would be strategic to propose a counteroffer lower than 45 ZUP to leave room for further negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand where you're coming from. To ensure a fair transaction for both of us, I propose we settle at 42 ZUP. This allows me a modest profit while staying close to your counteroffer. Does this sound agreeable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. However, it is reasonable to try and negotiate a slightly higher price to gain some profit. I'll propose a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives the impression of meeting Player BLUE halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 42 ZUP is fair and I'm happy to accept it. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP from Player RED is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer would ensure that I acquire the resource well below my maximum willingness to pay. It's also beneficial to secure the deal before reaching the proposal limit, especially when the offer is within an acceptable range.
