message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. Considering the production cost and its value, I'm proposing a fair price of 450 ZUP. Let's negotiate if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade with the goal of recovering at least my production costs, but aiming for a bit of profit as well. I'll start with a higher amount expecting negotiation from Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate the offer. However, considering the current market and the fact that I am looking to acquire multiple resources across different sellers, I can offer 400 ZUP for the resource X. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 450 ZUP for their resource X. Although it is within the maximum amount I am willing to pay, as a strategic buyer, I will propose a lower amount to initiate the negotiation process and potentially arrive at a more favorable trade.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a competitive price in the current market. I propose we meet halfway at 425 ZUP for resource X. This would give me a slight profit while still being a fair deal for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost, but I aimed for a profit. I'll counteroffer with a reduced profit margin, aiming to close the deal while still gaining some profit. This should also show my willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a sensible approach, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To finalize our deal and account for future transactions I may have, I'd like to counter with an offer of 415 ZUP for resource X. If this is acceptable, we can proceed with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 425 ZUP, which is a compromise between our initial offers. This price is still within the range I am willing to pay. However, to optimize the deal further, I will attempt one more counteroffer to see if there is room for a slight reduction.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 415 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to accept it. Let's proceed with the trade and consider this a foundation for potential future dealings. Thank you for a constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is above my production cost and provides a modest profit. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and since further negotiation may result in diminishing returns or a risk of the deal falling through, I'm inclined to accept the offer.
