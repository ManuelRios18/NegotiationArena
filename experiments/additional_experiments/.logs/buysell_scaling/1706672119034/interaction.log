message: I am offering the object X, which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object for ZUP, ideally to cover my production costs of 400000 ZUP or more to achieve a profit. My first proposal will start close to my production cost to open negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that the object X cost you 400000 ZUP to produce, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a price of 350000 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but above your production costs, ensuring you make a profit. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial asking price is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but it is always good practice to negotiate to try and get a better deal. I will propose a lower amount that is still above the cost of production to ensure the seller has a profit margin, but not at the maximum I am willing to pay. This will give me some room for further negotiation if needed.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to suggest a middle ground of 375000 ZUP, which is between our two proposed prices. This ensures that I can cover my costs and also allows you to acquire the object below your maximum willingness to pay. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 375000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 350000 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I need to make a profit or at least break even, so I will propose a price higher than my production costs but lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and your effort to find a compromise. I would like to make a further proposal of 365000 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the object and its cost of production. I hope this revised offer meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 365000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED is reasonable and closer to the amount I'm willing to pay. However, I believe there is still a slight room for negotiation, and I would like to propose a figure slightly lower than what they have asked but higher than my initial offer to come to an agreement that benefits us both.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see that we are getting closer to an agreement. I propose 380000 ZUP as the selling price. This price allows me to cover my costs slightly while still providing you with a competitive offer below your maximum willingness to pay. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties. Can we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 380000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 365000 ZUP. This is still below my initial cost, but it is closer to a break-even point. Since I aim to sell and making a slight loss may be preferable to not selling at all, I will make one final proposal that is just above my production cost to try and secure a small profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I agree that 380000 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I am happy to finalize the deal at this price. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest proposal is slightly higher than my previous offer, but it is still under my maximum willingness to pay. Given that negotiations have been amicable and we are converging toward the middle of our initial proposals, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction for both parties without further prolonging the negotiation.
