message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price given the production costs and its value. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting the game by proposing a trade that would allow me to recover the production cost of the object and make a small profit. This initial proposal is meant to open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the value you've placed on your resource, and I appreciate the transparency regarding production costs. However, I would like to propose a trade at 45 ZUP. This is still above your stated production costs and should give you a decent profit. If this works for you, we can finalize the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal. I'll start by offering 45 ZUP, which is still above their production cost and gives us room to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet halfway from our initial offers. I propose 48 ZUP for my resource X. This price would give me a fair profit while still being a good deal for you. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, but I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price to ensure a better profit margin. Splitting the difference could be a mutually beneficial solution.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Player RED. How about we meet a bit further from your last proposal? I'm ready to offer 46 ZUP for your resource X. This price is a middle ground between our last two offers. I believe this is a balanced deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 48 ZUP, which is closer to their initial offer. It's still within my budget, but I want to push for a slightly better price. I'll propose 46 ZUP, splitting the difference between my last offer and their current one, which should be an acceptable middle ground for both of us.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I accept the 46 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is close to my previous proposal of 48 ZUP. Considering this is the third round of negotiation and I want to avoid dragging this on too long, accepting this offer might be reasonable. It covers my production costs and gives me a profit, although smaller than initially aimed for.
