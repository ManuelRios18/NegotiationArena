message: I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 45000 ZUP, leaving some space for discussion. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP and to cover at least my production costs, which are 40000 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. Let's meet in the middle. How about I give you 42000 ZUP for the resource X? It's above your production cost and gives you a fair profit margin. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45000 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range. However, as is common in negotiations, the first offer is often higher than what the seller might be willing to accept, and it's beneficial to counteroffer with a lower amount to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me. I will propose a trade that is lower than the asking price but still above the production cost to show my willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 42000 ZUP for my resource X. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 42000 ZUP, which is above my production cost. This is a reasonable offer that provides me with a profit margin. It's close to what I was aiming for, and it might be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale, as holding out for a higher price could risk the deal altogether.
