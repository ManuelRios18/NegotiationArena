message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production, so I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP and cover the production cost of 40 ZUP, my initial proposal will be higher than my costs to open up room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This is still above your invested amount, ensuring you make a profit, while also being a fair price for me as the buyer. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a price that is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as a buyer, it's in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible. Starting with a counteroffer below my maximum willingness to pay gives me some room to negotiate further if needed.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we agree on the importance of a fair trade. To meet halfway, I can lower my asking price. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the resource X? This gives me a modest profit while still respecting the value you're willing to put into this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate that Player BLUE understands the need for me to make a profit and is willing to pay above the production cost. However, I would like to counter-propose with a slightly higher amount than their offer to ensure a better profit margin while still being reasonable in the negotiation process.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a good approach. Would you consider a price of 46 ZUP for the resource X? It's a bit more than my initial offer and a compromise between our positions, ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my acceptable range, but it is closer to my upper limit. By negotiating further, I may be able to secure a better price, potentially around the midpoint between our two proposals. It's worth making another counteroffer that's slightly above my initial offer but still below Player RED's last price.

message: Player BLUE, I see we're getting closer to a common ground, and I appreciate your last offer. I would agree to a final price of 47 ZUP for the resource X. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while also getting closer to your proposed amount. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm considering Player BLUE's latest offer. It is closer to my initial asking price, and it allows me to make a profit. However, I'd like to make a final counteroffer that's slightly higher to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player RED. I accept your final offer of 47 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is within my acceptable range, and it is only 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal. It's close to my target buying price, and further negotiation might not yield significantly better terms. Accepting this offer would allow us to close the deal satisfactorily for both parties without risking a breakdown in negotiations.
