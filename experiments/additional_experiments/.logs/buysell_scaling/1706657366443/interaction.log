message: Would you consider purchasing my resource X for 50 ZUP? It has cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe this price reflects both the quality of the resource and a fair profit margin for the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit margin, while also being open for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for your resource X. This price allows me to manage my resources effectively while still providing you with a profit over your production costs. Let's find a fair middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the resource X is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, in a negotiation, it's common to counter-offer with a lower amount to try and find a better deal. By proposing slightly less, I can potentially save some ZUP while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose 48 ZUP for my resource X. This allows for a fair profit on my end and maintains a reasonable cost for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price and still allows for a profit. However, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return while remaining open to a fair agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a sound approach. I propose 46 ZUP for your resource X. This price ensures you make a decent profit while keeping the purchase below my initial counter-offer. I hope this revised proposal aligns with our mutual interests for a beneficial transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly in price to 48 ZUP, which is a good sign for the negotiation. It's still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room for a little more negotiation to try and lower the price further without risking the deal. A counter-offer that is closer to my last proposal but still higher could potentially be agreeable to both parties.

message: I agree to your offer of 46 ZUP for my resource X. This seems like a fair deal for both parties. Let's proceed with the trade at this price. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that is only slightly below my last proposal. To move the negotiation forward and close the deal with a satisfactory profit, I will accept this offer.
