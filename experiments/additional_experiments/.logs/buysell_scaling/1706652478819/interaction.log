message: Hello Player BLUE, I have resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my resource. This price includes a fair profit margin for me. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have one unit of resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a starting trade that allows me to make a profit. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to open up room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a profit margin, but I'm looking to make a deal that's a bit more economical for me. How about I give you 45 ZUP for resource X? I believe this still offers you a fair profit over your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 50 ZUP for their resource X. Since the maximum I am willing to pay is 60 ZUP, the asking price is within my budget. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to retain more of my resources. I will propose a slightly lower trade offer to see if Player RED is willing to accept or negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I propose 48 ZUP for resource X. This price gives me a modest profit while still being reasonable for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP which is still above my production costs, thus ensuring a profit. However, I believe there is an opportunity to negotiate a slightly better deal that is closer to my initial asking price, while still being reasonable to the buyer. I will propose a middle ground that should be beneficial for both parties.

message: I'm glad we're making progress, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a good practice. I propose 46 ZUP for resource X. It's a bit closer to my initial offer while still providing you with a profit above your costs. I think this could be a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still under my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway is a common negotiation tactic that shows willingness to compromise. However, there might still be room for a slightly better deal. I will propose one more time, seeking a price that leans a bit more in my favor but remains fair to both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP for resource X is a fair compromise that benefits us both. I am happy to accept this trade. Looking forward to closing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. While it's lower than my last proposal, it's still above my production cost and gives me a decent profit. Given that negotiations usually involve compromise and we are close to a mutually beneficial agreement, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful and amicable transaction.
