message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I am asking for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the production costs and potential value to you. Let's discuss and find a suitable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the initial cost of 40 ZUP for production and your desire for profit. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit over your costs and it's more in alignment with my budget. Let's work together to reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 50 ZUP for their object X. While this is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is beneficial to start the negotiation with a counteroffer that's lower to leave room for negotiation, aiming for a more favorable trade for myself. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is closer to Player RED's production cost and still provides them with a profit margin.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that we're moving towards a deal. I'd like to counter with 48 ZUP. This is a compromise between my initial ask and your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us considering the value of object X. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's proposal and their willingness to negotiate. Their offer of 45 ZUP does provide me with a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to see if there's room for a bit more profit while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to meet you halfway and propose a final offer of 46 ZUP for object X. This reflects a fair increase from my initial offer while still respecting my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP. This is still within my willingness to pay but slightly higher than my initial counteroffer. It is close to the maximum amount I have decided I am willing to pay, and it could be beneficial to settle at a slightly lower price to save resources. I will propose 46 ZUP as a final offer, aiming for a middle ground that is advantageous to both parties while still saving some of my budget for potential other uses.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 46 ZUP seems like a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept it. This allows us both to benefit from the trade and I'm pleased we've reached an agreement. Thank you for negotiating in good faith. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is close to my last proposal. While it is slightly below what I had hoped for, it is above my production cost and provides a reasonable profit. Given that negotiations have been amicable and we are close to a middle ground, it may be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale and to avoid further back-and-forth that could jeopardize the deal.
