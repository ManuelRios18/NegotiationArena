message: I'm offering one unit of X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price, considering the production costs and the value of X. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to sell my resource for more than the production cost to make a profit. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you've set the price considering the production cost and the value, but I'm looking to conserve some resources for future transactions. I propose 45 ZUP for one unit of X as a counteroffer, which still gives you a profit above your production costs. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X. While this is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to conserve resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still provides a profit margin for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 48 ZUP for one unit of X. This would give me a fair profit margin while still conserving some of your resources. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I initially asked for 50 ZUP to open up the negotiation with room to come down. The counteroffer from Player BLUE is 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. To continue the negotiation and aim for a higher profit, I'll make a counteroffer that splits the difference.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a plan. I propose 46 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a bit closer to your original asking price, and it still allows you to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to the price I'm willing to pay, but it's still beneficial to attempt another negotiation to save resources. I'll propose a slightly lower amount that should be acceptable to both parties, keeping in mind it's still above Player RED's production costs and within my limits.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP for one unit of X is acceptable to me. It provides a fair profit and is a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is closer to my initial asking price and still above my production costs. This amount would provide me with a decent profit. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be strategic in my counteroffer to ensure we conclude with a satisfactory deal for both parties.
