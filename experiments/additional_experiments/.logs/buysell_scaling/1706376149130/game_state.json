It is only a 5 ZUP difference from what I last offered, which is a negligible amount in the context of my maximum budget. It would be reasonable to accept this offer to secure the resource and finalize the transaction, ensuring a successful negotiation for both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Player RED, your offer of 420 ZUP for resource X sounds good to me.
