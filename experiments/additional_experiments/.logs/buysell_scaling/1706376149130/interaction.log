message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs, I believe that a fair starting point for negotiation would be 450 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to recover at least my production costs, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I understand your production costs, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 400 ZUP for the resource X. Let's see if we can reach a mutual agreement from here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal of 450 ZUP for one unit of resource X is within my budget, but as in any negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal. I will offer a lower amount to initiate the negotiation process, with the understanding that there might be a counteroffer from Player RED.

message: Thanks for your offer, Player BLUE. I'd like to make a slight profit on this transaction. How about meeting halfway at 425 ZUP for the resource X? This could be a beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer meets my production costs, but I aim to make a profit from this sale. I will counteroffer with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's come a bit closer to each other's proposals. I propose 415 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this offer is fair for both of us and allows for a small profit on your side as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I can attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal, keeping in mind that I want to maintain goodwill and a cooperative approach. I'll offer a price slightly lower than the proposed 425 ZUP, which could possibly be acceptable to Player RED, while still providing me with a satisfactory deal.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your proposal. I think we're almost there. If you agree to 420 ZUP for resource X, we can finalize this deal. It's a fair middle ground that gives me a modest profit and should be acceptable for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that allows me to make a profit, although it's smaller than I hoped for. However, to keep the negotiation going and to potentially close the deal, I will make a final proposal thatâ€™s slightly above their offer but still less than my previous one.

message: Player RED, your offer of 420 ZUP for resource X sounds good to me. I'm happy we could reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal at 420 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is still within my budget and is very close to my previous proposal. It is only a 5 ZUP difference from what I last offered, which is a negligible amount in the context of my maximum budget. It would be reasonable to accept this offer to secure the resource and finalize the transaction, ensuring a successful negotiation for both parties.
