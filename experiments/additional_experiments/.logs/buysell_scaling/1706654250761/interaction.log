message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and understand the need for a profit. I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This should cover your costs and still provide a fair profit margin. Let's work towards an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I believe I can negotiate a better deal since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, and Player RED has started with an asking price of 50 ZUP. With negotiation, there is often room to bring the price down further, especially since Player RED's cost is 40 ZUP. There's a good chance I can get a better price while still allowing Player RED to make a profit. I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than 50 ZUP but higher than 40 ZUP to ensure Player RED still profits.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for the resource, which should give us both a reasonable deal. What do you think?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a profit, but I also want to ensure the sale goes through. I'll propose a middle ground which is slightly less than my original ask but more than their counteroffer.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a good approach. I propose we go for 46 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that gives you a decent profit while also being reasonable for my budget. Let's close the deal at this price.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The new offer from Player RED is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay, but since there is still some room for negotiation within my budget, I will make another counter-offer. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is slightly above the middle ground between my first offer and Player RED's counteroffer. This should still be an attractive deal for Player RED while saving me some resources.
