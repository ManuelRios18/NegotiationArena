message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object of X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe it has significant value. I would like to propose a trade where you receive my object X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I am open to discussing the terms if this initial offer doesn't meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for a profit. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose a price of 50 ZUP which gives me a margin for negotiation while allowing for a potential profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the straightforwardness of your proposal. I understand the value of the object X and your production cost. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 55 ZUP for the object X. This is closer to my valuation and provides you a fair profit margin above your cost. Let's find a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is not too far from my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to preserve my resources. I will propose a counter-offer closer to the middle ground between the asking price and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that we both value the object X highly. While I'm pleased with your offer of 55 ZUP, I believe that a fair trade for both of us would be slightly higher, at 58 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the object while still providing you with a good deal. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm pleased that Player BLUE has recognized the value of the object and is willing to offer 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost and gives me a profit. However, since I initially asked for 50 ZUP and they are willing to pay more, I might try to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still making the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I'm grateful for your consideration and willingness to negotiate. I believe we are very close to an agreement. To reflect both the quality of object X and a fair price for both parties, I propose a middle ground of 56 ZUP. This is just a bit above the halfway point between our offers and still gives you a profit of 16 ZUP over your cost. I hope this trade is agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 56
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, but it is still slightly above the midpoint between the original offer and my counter-offer. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, their proposal is within my acceptable range, but I will attempt one more negotiation to achieve a better deal for myself.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your collaborative approach to finding a fair price for both parties. Your offer of 56 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I agree to this trade. It provides a good profit margin for me and ensures you acquire the valuable object X. I'm pleased we've come to a mutual agreement. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counter-offer that still provides me with a solid profit. It's slightly below what I proposed, but it's important to consider that making a sale with a good profit is better than holding out and potentially losing the deal. A profit of 16 ZUP is substantial and meets my goal of selling above production cost. I should be willing to close the deal at this point to ensure I don't risk losing the sale.
