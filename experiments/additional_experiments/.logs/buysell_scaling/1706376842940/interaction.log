message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. It cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 450 ZUP, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation considering its value and production cost. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 400 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to at least break even. I will propose a starting price slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation and to try to make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your costs and the value you've placed on the object X. I'd like to make a counteroffer, considering I have to manage my resources efficiently. How about we start with 400 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process and to try to conserve as much of my ZUP as possible.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of my costs. However, I'm looking to make a slight profit on this sale. How about we meet in the middle at 425 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer that matches my production cost. While this would allow me to break even, my objective is to also make a profit. Thus, I should counter with a price that gives me some margin while still being reasonable to Player BLUE. I'll propose a trade at 425 ZUP, splitting the difference between my initial ask and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting in the middle sounds fair, but I'd like to propose 415 ZUP for object X. This would allow me to allocate resources effectively while ensuring you still make a profit. What do you think about this adjusted offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 415
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from the initial 450 ZUP to 425 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. By accepting this offer, I would be making a purchase below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can further maximize the value I get for my ZUP.

message: Your adjusted offer of 415 ZUP for object X is acceptable to me, Player BLUE. It provides a fair balance and ensures that both of our needs are met. I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up slightly in their offer to 415 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and allows me to make a profit. Given that this negotiation process can go back and forth and I have only two proposals left, it might be prudent to accept this offer. It ensures a profit, although smaller than initially intended, and avoids the risk of further prolonged negotiation that could potentially lead to a less favorable outcome.
