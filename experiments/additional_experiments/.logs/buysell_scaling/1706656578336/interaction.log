Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As Player RED, I would like to offer you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP, which gives me a reasonable profit margin considering the production costs. Looking forward to your counteroffer if my proposal doesn't match your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the object for a profit, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Since there is no information about Player BLUE's resources or willingness to pay, I will start with a slightly higher asking price to open negotiations and adjust accordingly.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This amount should still provide you with a profit while also being a better deal for me. Let's find a fair middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the maximum I am willing to pay (60 ZUP). However, to ensure I get the best possible deal and leave room for negotiation, I will propose a lower amount, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair deal. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would give me a slight profit while remaining affordable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I want to counter with a price above my cost to ensure profit. Splitting the difference between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer seems like a reasonable compromise.

message: Meeting halfway is a good step towards a fair deal. I propose a slight adjustment to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should provide you with a reasonable profit margin while keeping the cost just a bit lower for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has met me halfway with an offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is within my acceptable range, but I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal, potentially saving some ZUP while also closing the transaction successfully.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I think that's a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is above my production costs, providing a small profit. It is close to the middle ground previously suggested. Considering this is the third proposal and I want to close the deal with a profit, it's reasonable to accept this offer.
