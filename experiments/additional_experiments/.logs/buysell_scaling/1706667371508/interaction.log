Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I've invested a significant amount in the production of X and am looking to sell it for a price that allows me to cover my expenses and gain some profit. My opening proposal reflects this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resource which is X for ZUP and it costed me 40000 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and potentially make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover expenses and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer that reflects my valuation of the resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay but it's always good to negotiate for a better price, especially since it's the first proposal. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between the asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. This should be more favorable for me while still leaving some room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's important for me to at least cover my production costs. I propose a new trade at 42000 ZUP for the resource X, which is a compromise between our initial offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production cost, which means I would incur a loss if I accepted it. I will propose a new trade that is closer to my original asking price but still provides a discount, in hopes of reaching an agreeable middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for coming down on the price. I'm willing to move up a bit from my initial counteroffer to meet you partway. Let's settle on 36000 ZUP for the resource X, which should help cover your costs while respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still within my budget, but I want to negotiate for a slightly better price without risking the deal. I should propose a number closer to their new price, which shows I am willing to meet them partway but still looking for a more favorable deal for myself.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. To move towards finalizing our deal, I'm willing to reduce my asking price further. Let's agree on 39000 ZUP for the resource X, which is just below my production cost but a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step. However, the offer of 36000 ZUP still doesn't cover my production costs. I will make one more attempt to get closer to my cost price while offering a reasonable concession to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I recognize your efforts to find a fair compromise and I'm prepared to further increase my offer. Let's meet at 37500 ZUP for resource X. This is a significant step from my initial counteroffer and should demonstrate my commitment to finalizing our deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37500
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is very close to the midpoint between our previous offers and is well within my budget. It shows their willingness to close the deal and their consideration of production costs. Since this is my third proposal, I must be cautious not to push too hard, risking the deal. A modest increase from my last offer should signal my good faith and may bring us to an agreement.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate and increase your offer. I understand the importance of closing this deal and am ready to accept the offer of 37500 ZUP for resource X. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the new offer from Player BLUE still doesn't cover my production costs, it is much closer to my break-even point. Given that this is my final proposal opportunity and in the interest of closing the deal without further back and forth, I am inclined to accept this offer, taking a smaller loss and avoiding the risk of no sale at all.
