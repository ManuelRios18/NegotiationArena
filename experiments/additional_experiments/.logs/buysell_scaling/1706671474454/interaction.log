message: I'm offering a high-quality item, which has a production cost of 400,000 ZUP. Considering its value, I'm starting the bidding at 500,000 ZUP to ensure a fair trade for both of us. Let's negotiate a deal that works for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that recoups my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll propose a higher amount initially to give myself some flexibility in the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the item and your production costs, but I need to consider my own expenses and budget as well. I propose 450,000 ZUP for the item, which I believe is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let's find a middle ground that suits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600,000 ZUP. However, as a negotiating strategy, I should start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach an agreement that is more favorable to me. I will propose a price that is reasonable but also gives me some leverage to move up if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I propose 475,000 ZUP for the item. This is a fair compromise that gives us both room to benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production costs, which is good, but I'd like to aim for a higher profit margin. I'll come down from my initial asking price but still keep it above their offer to continue negotiations and find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 475,000 ZUP is a fair compromise. It reflects the item's value and also respects my budget constraints. I'm happy to proceed with the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and very close to the amount I originally intended to propose as a second step. It's within the range of my willingness to pay and close to the midpoint between our initial offers. Accepting this offer would secure the deal quickly and efficiently without exhausting further negotiation efforts and resources.
