message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade where you give me 500 ZUP for this object. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the objective is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost 400 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a trade where I can make a profit. I will propose a trade with a higher price, anticipating negotiation that may bring the price down to an acceptable level.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object but would like to propose a counteroffer of 450 ZUP. This still gives you a reasonable profit margin above your production cost, and it's more aligned with my resource management strategy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 600 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate to see if it's possible to obtain the object at a lower cost to preserve some of my resources for future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost that Player RED mentioned, but still provides them with some profit.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see we're close to an agreement. To meet halfway, I would be willing to lower my initial asking price to 475 ZUP. This revised proposal should benefit both of us, yielding me a fair profit while saving you from the full initial cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that still provides me with a profit, which is a good sign. However, since this is a negotiation and they've come up from my initial asking price, I believe there's room to propose a slightly higher amount to aim for a better profit while still showing willingness to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I propose a slightly adjusted amount of 460 ZUP, which I believe is fair for both of us, considering the production cost and value of the object. This way, you'll still make a decent profit, and I'll be able to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable effort to meet me halfway, reducing the price to 475 ZUP. This is still within my acceptable range, but as part of the negotiation process, I aim to secure the resources at the lowest possible cost without exhausting my proposals too quickly. I will make one more counteroffer, which is closer to their last price but still advantageous for me.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 460 ZUP for the object. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in price again, which suggests they are keen on acquiring the object but are mindful of their resources. The offer of 460 ZUP is above my production cost, ensuring a profit of 60 ZUP. Pushing for a higher price might risk the deal, and since the goal is to make a profit, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
