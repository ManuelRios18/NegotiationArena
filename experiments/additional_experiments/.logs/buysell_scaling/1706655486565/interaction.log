message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a reasonable profit margin. I hope this serves as a good starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also make a profit. However, I don't want to start with a price that is too high, as this might discourage Player BLUE from continuing the negotiation. I'll propose a price that is slightly above my costs.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the initial offer. I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the resource X. This price takes into consideration my budget and the current market value I have assessed for the resource. Let's find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation process, it may be beneficial to propose a counteroffer to see if we can agree on a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about budget and market value. I propose we meet in the middle with a trade of 1 unit of resource X for 48 ZUP, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. This price covers my production costs and provides me with a modest profit. Let's work together to finalize this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer is below the initial asking price but is still above my production costs. I want to make a profit, so meeting in the middle could be a good compromise that ensures a fair deal for both parties. I'll propose a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above the counteroffer to maintain a profit margin.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that 48 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your proposal, and I'm happy to finalize this trade. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise of 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range of expenditure for resource X. It's a fair middle ground between our initial proposals, and accepting this offer would secure the resource without further negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through or the price increasing.
