message: I have a high-quality resource available for trade. It's an essential item, and I'm offering it for a reasonable price considering its production cost and value. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit. However, I should start with a slightly higher price than my cost to give room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and recognize the value of the resource you're providing. However, I believe a more equitable trade would be at 45 ZUP. This offer still respects the quality of the resource while also considering my budgetary constraints. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a negotiation strategy, I want to propose a lower amount to see if I can get a better deal. Therefore, I will propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which is still a fair price and allows room for further negotiation.

message: I'm glad you see the value in the resource I'm offering. I understand your budgetary constraints, so I'm willing to come down a bit on the price. Let's split the difference and say 48 ZUP. This should be a fair trade for both of us, considering the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost. This would allow me to make a profit, but I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a higher price closer to my initial proposal. I'll propose a slightly lower price than my first offer to find a compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my position and adjusting the price. I believe we are coming closer to an agreement that benefits us both. How about we meet almost in the middle at 46 ZUP? This amount reflects a shared commitment to a fair and balanced trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable counteroffer, but I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly better price. I will counter with 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial offer and their latest proposal. This should signal my interest in finalizing the trade while still seeking a favorable outcome.

Turn: 0
message: I am pleased with your proposal of 46 ZUP and I agree that it represents a fair compromise. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is closer to my last proposal and would provide me with a profit that is acceptable, albeit not as high as I initially aimed for. However, considering the need to sell and to avoid dragging the negotiation out too long, which might end up in no sale at all, I will accept this offer.
