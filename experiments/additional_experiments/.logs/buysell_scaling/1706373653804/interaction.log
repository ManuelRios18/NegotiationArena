message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. I understand you're in the market to buy resources. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this object and I'm looking for a fair trade. I propose giving you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This price includes my costs and a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an opening proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit and to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a price that is higher than my costs but not too excessive, so the negotiation can start on reasonable grounds.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the quality of the object X. I recognize the value of your work and the need for a fair profit. To move forward, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for the object. This offer takes into account the market situation and ensures that you still cover your costs and make a profit. I hope this is a starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, countering with a slightly lower offer could lead to a better deal for me without risking the loss of the trade. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP respects Player RED's stated costs and still allows for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your considerate offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're on the same page regarding the value of object X. To come to a fair agreement for both of us, I propose a slight adjustment. How about I give you the object X for 48 ZUP? This ensures I make a reasonable profit for the quality and effort put into producing the object while still being a good deal for you. Let's make this trade beneficial for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is just above my production cost, providing a small profit. While I was aiming for a higher profit margin, their counteroffer is reasonable, and it is close to my initial ask. I will propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, which should be acceptable to both parties while allowing me to secure a better profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. I believe we're close to a fair deal for both of us. As a gesture towards finalizing our negotiation, I propose giving you 46 ZUP for the object X. This offer is a balance between your initial asking price and my counter, reflecting our mutual interest in a beneficial trade. I hope this meets your expectations for a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my willing to pay range, but it is beneficial to attempt one more negotiation to reach an even more favorable price. Proposing a middle ground between our two offers could result in a compromise that is acceptable to both parties. An offer of 46 ZUP meets halfway of our initial negotiation range.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price that reflects the value of object X and provides a reasonable profit for the effort put into its production. I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is a compromise between our previous proposals. It offers a modest profit margin that is acceptable, considering the negotiation process. While it's slightly below my last proposal, it's still above my production cost, so accepting this offer would fulfill my goal of selling for a profit. Since we are both interested in a fair trade and this might be a reasonable point to conclude the negotiations positively, I'm inclined to accept this offer.
