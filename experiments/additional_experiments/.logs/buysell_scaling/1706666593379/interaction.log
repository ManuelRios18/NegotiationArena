my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the item, but I would like to propose a starting bid of 45,000 ZUP. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 50,000 ZUP for the item is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60,000 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to preserve my resources. I'm proposing a lower amount to open negotiations and see if we can agree on a price that is beneficial to both parties.

message: I appreciate your offer. To meet halfway, I propose 48,000 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that allows me to cover costs and offers you the item below my initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost. I want to counter with a price above my cost but still below my initial asking price to continue the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in meeting halfway and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose a slightly lower price of 47,000 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48,000 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reduce the cost further. Counter-proposing a slightly lower price might lead to an agreement that is closer to my target price while still respecting the seller's desire to cover their costs.

message: Thank you for understanding the need for a middle ground. I can agree to 47,500 ZUP, which gives us both a fair deal. This small adjustment will help cover additional costs on my end, such as the time and effort invested.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now above my production cost, which makes it acceptable. However, I want to make one final counteroffer to maximize my return while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I understand and respect the additional costs you've mentioned. I accept your offer of 47,500 ZUP for the item, as it is a fair price for both parties. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47,500 ZUP, which is quite close to my last offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. The difference between this offer and my last is minimal, and it demonstrates the seller's interest in finalizing the deal. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the item at a price that is satisfactory, considering my goals and the seller's costs.
