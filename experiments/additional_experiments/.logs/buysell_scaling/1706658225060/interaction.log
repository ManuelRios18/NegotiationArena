message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the production cost and the value of the resource. Let's discuss and come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a profit, but I also want to leave room for negotiation, so I will propose a price that is higher than my production cost.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is also a fair offer considering the market value and our respective needs. Let's find a middle ground that is satisfactory for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I have room to negotiate, so I will respond with a lower offer to leave space for further negotiation. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay but also above the average market value, assuming a fair market value would be somewhere in the middle.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 48 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit while also respecting the market value you mentioned. I hope this offer is closer to something we can both agree on.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is slightly above my production cost, which is good, but I would still like to aim for a higher profit margin. I will propose a compromise closer to my initial asking price, hoping to reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both sides.

message: I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, Player RED. This seems like a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my acceptable range. This offer is only 3 ZUP above my initial counteroffer and 12 ZUP below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the offer is reasonable and I want to secure the resources without prolonged negotiations, I am inclined to accept this trade.
