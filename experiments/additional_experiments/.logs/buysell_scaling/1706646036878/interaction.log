Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering the object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this offer interests you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the game by proposing a trade that would allow me to recover the production costs and potentially make a profit. By starting at a higher price than the cost, I can negotiate and find a middle ground that is satisfactory for both parties.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. Considering the production cost and the value of the object, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP which still ensures a profit for you. Are you open to this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still beneficial to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a trade that's closer to the cost of production for Player RED, but still provides them with a profit, while also saving me some ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I see that you're willing to ensure a profit for me, which I appreciate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for the object X. This amount would give me a reasonable profit and should be a fair trade for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE provides a profit, but it's slightly below the initial asking price. I believe there's room for negotiation, aiming for a compromise between the proposed amounts. I will make a counterproposal that still offers me a decent profit margin while moving closer to the amount Player BLUE is willing to pay.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair, and I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my last offer. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the object X? This should still provide you with a decent profit margin while keeping the trade within a comfortable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED made a counteroffer that is closer to their initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation tactic, and their offer is reasonable. However, as it is my second proposal, I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased with your willingness to find common ground. Your offer of 46 ZUP for the object X seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at this price. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. While the offer is still below my last proposal, it does provide a profit above production costs. To foster good relations and close the deal, I am inclined to accept this offer, as further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns and potential loss of the deal altogether.
