message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, selling at 35 ZUP would incur a loss for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about 42 ZUP for one unit of object X? This ensures that I cover my costs while still offering you a fair price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a loss. I will propose a new trade with a lower profit margin but still above my cost to find a middle ground.
