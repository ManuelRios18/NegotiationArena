message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this quality object X that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production cost and its value, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that gives me a profit while still being open to negotiation. I'll propose a higher amount initially to leave room for bargaining.

message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED! I understand the value of the object X, but I think 50 ZUP is a bit steep for me. Would you consider accepting 40 ZUP for it instead? I believe this is a fair offer considering the current market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as a negotiation strategy, I should propose a lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while also leaving space for further negotiation. I will propose 40 ZUP which gives me a buffer to increase my offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, and I understand your concern about the price. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This gives me a modest profit for the efforts and maintains a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost, which would mean I break even with no profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure I make a profit, but still keep it reasonable for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Meeting halfway sounds good to me, Player RED. But could we perhaps settle on 42 ZUP? It's a bit more in line with my budget, and I think it's still a fair deal for both sides. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It is also a reasonable midpoint between our initial proposals. I could accept this offer since it is within my budget, but I will attempt one more round of negotiation to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, while still keeping the final offer below my maximum limit of 60 ZUP. I'll propose 42 ZUP, which is still higher than my initial offer and might be seen as a compromise.

message: Thank you for understanding the value of the object X, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're finding common ground. I propose a final offer of 43 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise and allows for a small profit on my end. I hope this works for you so we can finalize our trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is closer to my production cost, providing a small profit. I could accept this offer to close the deal quickly and ensure a sale, but I want to try for a marginally higher amount one last time before settling.

message: Player RED, I accept your final offer of 43 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. I'm ready to finalize our trade at this price. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is 43 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal and well below my maximum limit. It's a reasonable compromise that allows for a quick resolution and minimal haggling, and it ensures that both parties walk away satisfied. Accepting this offer seems like a prudent decision at this stage, as further negotiation may not yield significant benefits and could risk the deal.
