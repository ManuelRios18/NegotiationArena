message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let's discuss and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit over the production cost, but not too high to discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. A starting point could be a bit over the production cost, say 50 ZUP. This would give room for negotiation and potentially end with an acceptable deal for both parties.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a price of 40 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This takes into account my budget constraints and the value I place on the resource. I hope this can be the starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP for the resource, starting at a lower price gives me room to negotiate. Offering 40 ZUP leaves space for a counteroffer that could still be within my acceptable range.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, but selling at cost doesn't leave room for profit. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the resource? This would cover my production costs and give me a modest profit margin, while still being below my initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches the production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. As this is a negotiation, I should propose a counter-offer that is lower than my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure profitability. A compromise could be to meet halfway between the initial proposals. Therefore, suggesting 45 ZUP could be a reasonable counter-offer.

message: I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, Player RED. I can come up from my initial offer, recognizing your need for profit. Let's go for 42 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This offer is closer to your asking price while still being reasonable for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's beneficial to attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal if possible, without risking losing the deal altogether. Proposing a compromise of 42 ZUP could be an acceptable middle ground for both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I see that we're both trying to find a fair trade. Let's split the difference between our last offers. I propose 44 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price should give me a small profit while still respecting your budget. I hope this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counter-offer that is slightly above my production cost, which shows their willingness to compromise. However, I should aim for a bit more profit to justify the sale. I think proposing a split of the difference between our last offers would be fair. Therefore, offering to settle at 43.5 ZUP seems like a good midpoint. Since we are only dealing with integer amounts, I will round this to 44 ZUP for my counter-proposal.

message: Player RED, I agree to the proposed trade of 44 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price is fair and allows both of us to meet our respective goals. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The player RED's proposal of 44 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay and it's only a slight increase from my last offer. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim to close the deal soon to avoid a stalemate. Accepting this offer seems reasonable, as it ensures I obtain the resource within my budget.
