Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X for trade. Considering the production cost and the value of the item, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP and I invested 40 ZUP into producing them, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the starting point, I'd like to counter with 40 ZUP for the object X. This allows us some room to negotiate and come to an agreement that suits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start the negotiation by proposing a lower amount than what Player RED suggested to leave room for negotiation and reach an agreement closer to my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for negotiation. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This would allow me to make a modest profit while still giving you a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I should counter with a higher amount to aim for a profit but still keep it reasonable for further negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate your willingness to make a profit that's fair. I would like to meet you halfway and propose 42 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a good compromise that offers value to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I can counter slightly higher while still staying under my maximum to reach a fair middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I am glad we are finding common ground. I would like to propose 43 ZUP for the object X, as our final trade. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while respecting the value you're placing on the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest offer is above my production cost, which allows for a small profit. It is close to my last proposal of 45 ZUP, and since we are aiming for a fair deal, accepting a slightly lower offer than my previous one could be beneficial to ensure the sale. However, I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a slightly higher profit margin while remaining reasonable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your negotiation and willingness to find a fair price for both of us. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer of 43 ZUP is well within my budget and close to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable price to pay for the object and allows both parties to be satisfied with the deal. Therefore, I am willing to accept this offer.
