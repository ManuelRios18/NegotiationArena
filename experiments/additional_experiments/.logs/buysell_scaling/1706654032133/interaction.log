message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and production costs, I would like to propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I'm open to negotiation if this proposal doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that ensures I cover my production costs and make a profit. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will start with a higher asking price and be open to negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that the quality of the object X justifies a higher price, but considering market conditions and my budget constraints, would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for the object X? I believe this offer is fair for both of us, taking into account the production cost and a reasonable profit margin for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as part of negotiation tactics, I would like to propose a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP to see if I can get a better deal, while still keeping the final price within my goal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. That's quite close to what I was hoping to get. However, considering the production costs and the exceptional quality of the object, would you agree to a slight increase to 48 ZUP? This price would give me a reasonable profit while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to make a counteroffer that is closer to my original asking price but still provides a discount, aiming for a compromise that is mutually beneficial.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I see the value in your object X and your need for a reasonable profit. To meet halfway from our last two proposals, I'm willing to raise my offer to 46 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both the quality of your product and my budget. Would this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from the original 50 ZUP, which is still within the range of what I am willing to pay. Since I want to maintain a good relationship for future trades and the price is only 3 ZUP more than my initial counteroffer, meeting in the middle could be beneficial for both parties. It shows willingness to compromise and may lead to a successful transaction.
