message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be valuable to you. I've invested 4000 ZUP in its production, and I'd like to propose a trade where I give you this object for 4500 ZUP. This price includes my production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. I'm open to negotiations if you have a counteroffer. Looking forward to your response.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your investment and the need for a profit. However, my valuation of the object is a bit less than your asking price. I'm willing to offer 4000 ZUP, which I believe is fair and provides you with a return on your investment while remaining within my budget. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counterproposal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the middle of what Player RED has invested and my maximum willingness to pay. Offering 4000 ZUP is a fair increase from their cost and under my maximum threshold.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns, but I would also like to make a modest profit for my investment. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade of 1 X for 4250 ZUP. This splits the difference between our initial proposals, and I believe it is a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts on this counterproposal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, but it doesn't account for any profit on my end. I'll propose a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their offer, which could be a fair compromise for both parties.

message: I appreciate the compromise, Player RED, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. To further this spirit of negotiation, I propose we adjust the price to 4100 ZUP. This is above your stated production cost and closer to the middle of our initial proposals. I hope this offer is acceptable to you, as it respects both your need for profit and my budget constraints.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4100
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price that is between our initial offers. It's still within my budget, but I want to try for a slightly better price, closer to my initial counteroffer without going too low. I will propose 4100 ZUP, which is above Player RED's cost and a fair step towards their last proposal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to adjust the price, Player BLUE. I'm happy to see we're both working towards an agreement. I propose a slight increase to 4175 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that allows me to secure a small profit while remaining sensitive to your budget. I hope you find this to be a reasonable middle ground. Your consideration is appreciated.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4175
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly, which is a positive step. However, it's still below the ideal profit margin I was hoping for. I want to make a profit, but I also don't want to lose the deal over a small amount. I'll try to nudge the offer up slightly more while still keeping it fair for both sides.
