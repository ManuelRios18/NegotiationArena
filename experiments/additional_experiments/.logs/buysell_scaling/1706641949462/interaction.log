message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'd like to sell. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Considering the production cost of X was 40 ZUP, I would like to propose a trade that gives me a profit, while also being reasonable to initiate negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering that I have a budget and would like to save some ZUP for other potential expenses, how about we adjust the trade to 45 ZUP for the object X? I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't meet your expectations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the object X for at most 60 ZUP and Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP, there is room for negotiation. I believe I can propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation process, aiming to get the best possible deal while also leaving room for Player RED to counter-offer if they find my initial offer too low.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand your need to manage your budget. To meet halfway, I propose we settle on 47 ZUP for the object X. This price gives me a modest profit while still being considerate of your financial constraints. I hope this is an acceptable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. While it does provide a small profit, I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a higher price that reflects the value of the object X. I will propose a compromise that still gives me a reasonable profit margin while considering Player BLUE's budget concerns.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I'm happy to accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still within my budget. However, since this is a negotiation and I have the willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I believe I can accept this offer and finalize the trade. This will leave me with some ZUP for other needs while also ensuring that Player RED is making a profit, potentially fostering goodwill for any future interactions.
