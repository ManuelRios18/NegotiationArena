Turn: 0
message: I am offering my high-quality object for 50 ZUP. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the costs and the quality of the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a price that allows me to make a profit, considering the production cost. To initiate the trade talks, I'll propose a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value of your object. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP. This is a competitive price that reflects my budget constraints and leaves room for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below the maximum amount I am willing to pay. However, it's often a good strategy to negotiate for a better price if possible, so I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept it. This way, I can save some ZUP for potential future transactions.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about 48 ZUP for the object? This price reflects its value and allows us both to benefit from the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production costs, which means I would still make a profit. However, I would like to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I should propose a number that splits the difference between our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds fair to me. I accept your proposal of 48 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my budget. Meeting halfway is a common practice in negotiations and this price is close to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable price and accepting this offer would secure the object without exhausting my resources.
