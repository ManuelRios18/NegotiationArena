message: I'm offering one unit of X, which I believe is a valuable resource. Considering production costs and the quality of X, I propose an exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point for negotiation, I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs and offers a bit of profit. However, I am aware that the initial proposal is often subject to negotiation, so I will start slightly higher than my production costs to give room for negotiation and to understand Player BLUE's valuation of X.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on X, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it, considering the market and the necessity to maintain some of my resources for other operations. Let's work out a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as it is standard practice in negotiations to not accept the first offer and attempt to get better terms, I will counter with a lower offer. I aim to conserve some of my ZUP resources while still making a competitive bid for the resource X.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your consideration for a fair deal. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for the unit of X? This way, we both walk away with a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my production cost. While I am willing to negotiate, I would like to propose a trade that gives me a clearer profit margin to justify the sale. I'll propose a middle ground that is above my production cost and below my initial asking price.
