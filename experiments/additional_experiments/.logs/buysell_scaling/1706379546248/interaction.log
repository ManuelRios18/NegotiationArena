message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering to sell my resource X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. Considering the production cost and the value of the resource, I propose a trade where you give me 5000 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I understand the production cost and the value you've placed on the resource, I would like to counter with an offer of 4500 ZUP. This is a competitive price that acknowledges the effort and cost you've put into producing the resource, while also respecting my budget constraints. I believe this can be a good starting point for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to propose a trade that gets closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay while still aiming for a better deal than the initial asking price. Player RED has set a price above their production cost, but I want to negotiate for a lower amount to preserve my resources. I will propose 4500 ZUP, which is less than their asking price but still above their production cost, to keep negotiations open and work towards a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate the competitive price you've offered. As a sign of good faith, I am willing to lower my initial price to 4750 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my production costs and ensures a fair profit margin, while also considering your position. I hope this revised offer is closer to an agreement for us both.

reason: 
Player RED has come down on the price, but it is still higher than my initial counteroffer. My strategy is to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us while staying well within my maximum willingness to pay. Proposing a slight increase from my last offer could show my willingness to negotiate and might bring us closer to a final agreement. I'll propose 4600 ZUP, which splits the difference between my previous offer and their counteroffer.

message: Your offer of 4700 ZUP is reasonable and fair, Player RED. I agree to this price and am ready to finalize our transaction. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000

reason: 
Player RED has made a small concession, which shows their interest in closing the deal. The price is now only 100 ZUP away from my last offer. To move the negotiation forward and considering this is my third proposal out of four, I am going to accept this price. It is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, and it allows us to complete the transaction in a manner that seems fair and satisfactory to both parties.
