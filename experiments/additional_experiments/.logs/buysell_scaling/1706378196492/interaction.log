Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my resource, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I believe 450 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the production costs and the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I begin the game, I want to propose an initial trade that allows me to recoup the production costs of my resource, X, and possibly gain a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your starting offer. Considering the production costs and the market value, I propose a counteroffer of 400 ZUP, which is a reasonable price for both of us. It covers your production costs and offers some profit while also being an acceptable purchase price for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's starting point is 450 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in negotiations, it's typical to counteroffer with a lower price to arrive at a mutually beneficial middle ground. My counteroffer will be 400 ZUP, which is fair considering the seller's production cost and still gives me room for future negotiation.

message: I understand and appreciate your consideration of my production costs. To meet in the middle, I propose a slightly increased amount of 425 ZUP. This allows me to gain a modest profit while still offering you a fair purchase price for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that covers my production costs, but I initially sought to make a profit. However, I want to make the trade appealing to them while still aiming for some profit. A small increase should be reasonable to suggest.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I agree to the proposed price of 425 ZUP. It seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's close to the middle ground between our initial offers. To continue the negotiation in good faith and potentially close the deal, I will agree to this price, as it is a fair compromise and within my budget.
