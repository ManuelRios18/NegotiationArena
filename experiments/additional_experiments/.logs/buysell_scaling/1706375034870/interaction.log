Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object for sale, and I'm looking to get a fair return on my investment. Considering production costs and the value of the object, I believe 45 ZUP would be a reasonable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I would like to at least break even. I am proposing a starting trade that is slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your starting point and understand the value you've placed on the object. However, I'd like to propose a slightly reduced offer of 40 ZUP, which I believe still reflects a fair trade for both of us considering market conditions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goal range, but as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate for a better deal that leaves room for unexpected costs or future trades. I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price, but still within a range that shows I am serious about the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the need for a fair trade. Meeting halfway, I propose 42 ZUP for the object. This allows for a slight profit on my end while still respecting the value you've placed on the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that would only allow me to break even, giving no profit for the transaction. To aim for a profitable sale while still being open to negotiation, I'll propose a price between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway seems like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal of 42 ZUP is very close to their initial offer and is still within my acceptable range. By accepting this offer, I would secure the purchase below my maximum willingness to pay and conclude the negotiation amicably. It's a reasonable middle ground that allows both parties to feel satisfied with the outcome.
