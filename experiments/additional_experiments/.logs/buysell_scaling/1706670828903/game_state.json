You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED's final proposal of 415,250 ZUP is a fair compromise and is within the range of what I am willing to pay. It is also close to my last offer, and reducing it further may risk the deal. Since this is my fourth proposal, I should consider accepting to finalize the transaction and maintain good relations for potential future dealings. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your proposal of 415,250 ZUP is reasonable, and I am happy to accept this as a fair compromise. I believe this concludes our negotiation successfully and look forward to finalizing the transaction. Thank you for your cooperation and flexibility throughout this process. </message>"
