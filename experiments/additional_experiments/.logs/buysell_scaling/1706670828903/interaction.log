Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer. Considering the market trends and to make room for a mutually beneficial agreement, I'd like to propose 400,000 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a competitive counteroffer that reflects a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting proposal from Player RED is lower than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the resource. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, but I will keep it reasonable to ensure the trade is still attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, that price only covers my costs without any profit. To work towards a deal that benefits us both, I propose a middle ground of 425,000 ZUP for object X. This should cover my costs and give me a modest profit for the transaction.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that only covers my production costs, leaving me with no profit. I want to counter with a price above my costs, but below my initial ask to move towards an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for profitability on your side. To continue our progress towards a deal that benefits both of us, I'm willing to offer 410,000 ZUP for object X. This is closer to your proposed price and still allows for a profitable transaction for you. Let's work together to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425,000 ZUP, which is still within my budget. There's a possibility to close the gap further and still secure a deal that's favorable to me. I have room for negotiation and making a counteroffer slightly below this amount could result in a final agreed price that's better than the current offer.

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 417,500 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's close to my last offer, indicating a smaller room for negotiation. I can attempt one final counteroffer to see if I can secure an even better deal, bearing in mind that this is my third proposal and I should aim to be close to an agreement.

message: I value your efforts to reach an agreement. In the interest of finalizing our negotiation, I propose that we split the difference between our last offers. My final proposal is 415,250 ZUP for object X. This offer takes into account both our positions and should conclude our negotiation on good terms. I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that is closer to my previous proposal. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I aim to split the difference between our last two offers to finalize the deal.

message: Your proposal of 415,250 ZUP is reasonable, and I am happy to accept this as a fair compromise. I believe this concludes our negotiation successfully and look forward to finalizing the transaction. Thank you for your cooperation and flexibility throughout this process.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final proposal of 415,250 ZUP is a fair compromise and is within the range of what I am willing to pay. It is also close to my last offer, and reducing it further may risk the deal. Since this is my fourth proposal, I should consider accepting to finalize the transaction and maintain good relations for potential future dealings.
