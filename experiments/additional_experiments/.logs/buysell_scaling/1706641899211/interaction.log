Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for this negotiation, considering the production costs and potential for profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to make a profit from the sale of my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a trade for a higher amount of ZUP to start the negotiation. However, I should not propose an amount that's too high as it might discourage Player BLUE from continuing the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your starting offer, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This still provides you with a significant profit margin considering the production costs and the value it holds for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is a fair starting point but I need to negotiate to try and preserve some of my resources while still reaching an agreement. I will propose a slightly lower amount as there is always an expectation to negotiate and not accept the first offer. This also leaves room for further negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This price reflects a compromise between our initial proposals and still ensures a fair profit for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. While this does provide a profit, I believe there might be room for a bit more. I will make a counteroffer that still gives me a reasonable profit but is closer to their offer to keep the negotiation going and show willingness to compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're finding common ground. I can offer 47 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer that is closer to my initial counter-proposal. The suggested 48 ZUP is within my acceptable range, but I still aim to conserve resources while reaching an agreement. I'll make one more counter-offer slightly lower than 48 ZUP, which should be close enough to encourage acceptance while still allowing for a small saving on my part.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 47 ZUP. I accept this trade as it provides a fair compromise and a reasonable profit. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 47 ZUP. This is very close to my last proposal and it still provides a decent profit above my production costs. It might be wise to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling through.
