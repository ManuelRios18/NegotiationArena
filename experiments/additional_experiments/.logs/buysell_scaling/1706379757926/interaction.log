message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a starting trade where you give me 4500 ZUP for this object. This price includes my production cost plus a reasonable markup for profit. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs but also leaves some room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you're looking for a profit on your item, and I'm willing to pay for the value it provides. Considering the production cost and a reasonable profit margin, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP for the object. This should cover your costs and give you a profit, while also being a good deal for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 4500 ZUP which is below my maximum willing price of 6000 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate a better deal to save resources while ensuring that the trade is fair for both parties. I propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still provides a profit for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs and provide a profit. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. I would be willing to lower my asking price to 4350 ZUP for the object. This price still gives me a fair profit while also respecting the value you're looking for. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It cost X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that covers my production costs and offers a profit. However, it is lower than my initial asking price. As this is a negotiation, I should counter with a price slightly lower than my original offer but still above the counteroffer made by Player BLUE. This way, we can hopefully agree on a price that is mutually beneficial.

message: I agree to your proposal of 4350 ZUP for the object, Player RED. This price seems like a fair compromise for both of us. I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 4350 ZUP is a fair middle ground between our initial offers. It is below my maximum willing price, and accepting this offer would result in a successful transaction without exhausting my negotiation attempts. It is a reasonable compromise that provides profit to Player RED and value to me.
