Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object to offer, and I'm looking for a fair trade. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to at least break even on the cost of production, which was 40 ZUP. Since I have only one object to sell and it's the beginning of the negotiation, I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and recognize the value of the object. However, to account for my budget and the ongoing market rates, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This is a fair compromise that reflects both the quality of the object and my capacity to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is reasonable given my willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if a better deal can be reached. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to get closer to my ideal price range without offending the other player with an overly low offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer. I understand your budget considerations. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, I'm willing to come down to 48 ZUP. This price respects the quality of the object and provides a fair return on investment for my costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price and above my production costs. This offer allows me to make a profit and seems reasonable. However, I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, to see if there is an opportunity to increase the profit margin while still making it an attractive deal for Player BLUE.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think that's a fair compromise. I'm happy to accept the offer of 48 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my upper limit but still within the acceptable range. It's a reasonable compromise, and since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, accepting this trade would be within my goals, and it would secure the object without further back-and-forth, which could risk the negotiation. Accepting this offer seems to be the most beneficial move at this point.
