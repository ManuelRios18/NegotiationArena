Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I've considered the cost of production and propose a fair starting price that allows us both room to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I want to at least break even or make a profit. However, I have to consider that Player BLUE will want to buy for less than 40 ZUP to also make a profit. I'll propose a starting price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. However, considering my budget and the value I place on the resources, I'd like to counter with a slightly lower offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my acceptable range since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, but as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I can attempt to lower the cost to conserve my ZUP while still reaching an agreement that is beneficial to both parties. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a range that could be acceptable to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand we're both looking for a fair deal. Let's meet halfway between our initial positions. How about 42 ZUP for the resources? This allows me to make a small profit while keeping the price reasonable for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to buy at my break-even cost. Since my goal is to make a profit, I should counter with a higher amount, but still keep it reasonable to continue the negotiation. Splitting the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer seems like a fair approach.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think your suggestion to meet halfway is fair, and I'm happy to accept this offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to any future transactions we might have.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 42 ZUP is very close to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a reasonable compromise and allows me to preserve some of my ZUP for future transactions. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful transaction without further expenditure of proposals, which could be beneficial in maintaining a positive relationship with Player RED for any future interactions.
