message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. Considering the production costs, I think 500 ZUP would be a fair trade to start our negotiations. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade with an offer that gives me a profit over my production costs. Starting a bit higher leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the starting offer. I understand the cost of production for you is 400 ZUP. However, I'd like to propose 450 ZUP for the resource, considering that it is our first negotiation and I need to account for my own expenses and the value I place on the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to buy the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay which is 600 ZUP. Since the initial proposal from Player RED is 500 ZUP, I will counter with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to reach an agreement closer to the middle ground between 400 ZUP (their cost) and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand your need to manage expenses, I believe we can meet in the middle. How about we settle on 475 ZUP for the resource? I think it's a reasonable compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is still above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit. Splitting the difference between our initial offers could be an acceptable compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. 475 ZUP is closer to my limit, but I would like to propose 460 ZUP for the resource. This offer considers both our positions and moves us towards a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is higher than my initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. To progress towards a deal, I can increase my previous offer slightly, but I will still aim to pay less than the 475 ZUP proposed by Player RED.

message: Your offer of 460 ZUP sounds fair, and I'm happy to accept it. Let's finalize this deal at that price. Thank you for the negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's latest offer is less than my previous proposal, it still provides a reasonable profit margin. I want to close the deal and secure a profit without risking the negotiation dragging on and potentially falling through.
