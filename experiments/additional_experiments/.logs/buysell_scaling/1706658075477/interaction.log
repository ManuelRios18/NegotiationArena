message: I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. The resource has value and I've considered the production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let's discuss any counteroffers you might have.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I want to start with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation and potentially make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and your consideration of the costs. I believe there is a bit of room to discuss the price further. How about we adjust the ZUP slightly? I'm sure we can find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and the initial offer is well within my budget, it's a good starting point. However, it's common in negotiations to counteroffer to try and get a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair deal for both parties. I propose we meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal at 47 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and offers me a modest profit for the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. While this is above my production cost, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly higher price, which can provide me with a reasonable profit margin. My counteroffer will aim to meet in the middle between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds like a reasonable compromise. I am happy to accept your offer of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Looking forward to concluding this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer to meet halfway at 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This is still within my budget and seems like a fair compromise. It's slightly above my initial counteroffer but still below the maximum I'm willing to pay. Considering it's important to maintain good relations and ensure a positive transaction, I'm inclined to accept this offer.
