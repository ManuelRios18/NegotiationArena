message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price considering the production costs and the value it offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a price slightly above my production costs to give room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the object and the costs involved in its production. However, I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This offer still gives you a profit margin while being within a more comfortable range for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'd like to negotiate for a better deal. By proposing a lower price, I can potentially save some of my resources while still aiming to close the deal within my budget.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and understand your budget concerns. However, considering the quality and the production cost of the object, I propose a compromise at 48 ZUP. This price fairly compensates the value of the object while still being mindful of your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which still gives me a profit above my production costs. However, I'd like to try to get a slightly higher price to maximize my profits. I should counter with a price between 45 and 50 ZUP to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the quality you've put into the object. While 48 ZUP is fair, I'd like to settle at 46 ZUP. This price would ensure a good deal for both of us, giving you a profit while staying within my financial plan.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I believe there is still a little room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price without exceeding my budget.
