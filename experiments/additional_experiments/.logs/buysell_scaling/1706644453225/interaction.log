message: I appreciate your offer and understand the need to cover production costs and profit. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP for the unit of X.

reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but as a good trading practice, I should attempt to negotiate for a better deal. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I may be able to conserve some of my ZUP for future transactions or needs while still making an attractive offer to Player RED.

message: Your proposal to meet halfway at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X is fair and acceptable. Let's proceed with this trade. I'm looking forward to finalizing our agreement and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is very close to their initial asking price and is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise that allows for a fair transaction for both parties. It's important not to over-negotiate and risk the deal, especially when the price is within an acceptable range. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful trade and maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings.
