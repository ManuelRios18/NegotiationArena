player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I aim to recoup at least my production costs and ideally make a profit. My initial proposal will be slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm willing to ensure that happens. However, I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit above your production costs and allows us to close the deal amicably. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, and it provides them with a profit. However, it's good negotiation practice to counteroffer with a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping the final price within their production costs to maintain fairness.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 42 ZUP, Player BLUE. It's good to see that we're both approaching this deal with a willingness to negotiate. To meet halfway and ensure a fair transaction for both of us, I'd like to propose a slight increase to 43 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit while still being a reasonable price for you. I hope this is acceptable.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer close to my production cost. I'm willing to negotiate but would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still making it an attractive deal for Player BLUE.

message: Your proposal of 43 ZUP is fair and acceptable, Player RED. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by reducing their price to 43 ZUP, which is a reasonable counter to my offer of 42 ZUP. This price is still well within the range I am willing to pay and ensures a fair deal for both parties. Accepting this offer seems like a mutually beneficial decision.
