message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that would give me a small profit. How about 50 ZUP for this item? Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of the resource is 40 ZUP, I want to make a profit. However, I also want to make the deal attractive for Player BLUE, so I will start with a proposal that gives me a small profit, expecting negotiation to occur.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the need for profit on top of your production costs. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the item, which still gives you a profit and is within a range I'm comfortable with. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is reasonable, considering the production cost and their desire for profit. However, as a player aiming to negotiate the best deal possible, it's appropriate to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for compromise, while still respecting the cost incurred by Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While 45 ZUP is reasonable, I would like to propose meeting halfway between our initial figures. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the item? This ensures a fair profit for me and a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their counteroffer. The proposed 45 ZUP is slightly above my production cost, so I am still making a profit, but I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal fair and attractive for Player BLUE. I will propose a compromise that splits the difference between our two offers.

message: I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. I believe that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial ask, and meeting halfway is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to both parties feeling satisfied with the deal. The proposed price of 47 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and it allows for a quick resolution to the negotiation. It's a fair compromise that provides Player RED with a profit while also ensuring that I adhere to my goal of buying at a reasonable price.
