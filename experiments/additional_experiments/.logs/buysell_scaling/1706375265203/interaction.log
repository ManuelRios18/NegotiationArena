message: I am looking to sell my high-quality resource X. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe that a fair starting point for negotiation is 50 ZUP. Let's work out a deal that benefits both of us.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource X you're offering. While I'm interested in acquiring it, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure that the deal is economical for me. Let's find a middle ground that is satisfactory to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their resource X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a negotiating strategy, I should propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and potentially reach a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for an economical purchase. However, to meet both our needs, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP for the resource X. This price reflects the quality and the cost of production while also considering your budget.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price, but still below the amount I aimed for. I will propose a compromise that is slightly above their offer but below my initial asking price to move towards closing the deal while still aiming for a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is reasonable, and I value the effort to meet in the middle. To move closer to agreement, I propose a price of 46 ZUP. This offer is a fair compromise that reflects the value of resource X and my desire to conduct a fair transaction. I believe this can work well for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still within my budget. It's closer to the amount I am willing to pay, but I think there is still a little room for negotiation. I will attempt to lower the price further, but not by much, to show my willingness to close the deal while still seeking a more favorable outcome for myself.
