message: I understand the importance of resources, and I assure you that my resource X is of the highest quality. Considering the investment I've made into producing it, I propose a starting trade of 50000 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP, ideally to recoup my production costs of 40000 ZUP or more. I'm initiating with a high asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your resource, and I'm interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 48000 ZUP to reflect the current market conditions and my budget constraints. I believe this is still a competitive offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as in any negotiation, there's an opportunity to counter-offer for a better deal. I have room to negotiate up to 60000 ZUP but would like to get the resource for less if possible. My counteroffer will be lower than the asking price but still within a range that may be acceptable to the seller.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad to see we're in the same ballpark. To meet halfway and considering the quality and production costs of the resource, I'd like to propose 49000 ZUP. This should accommodate both our interests and reflect a fair market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 49000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with a slightly lower amount that is still above my production costs. This is a good sign that we are close to a deal, but I aim to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return.

Turn: 1
message: The offer of 49000 ZUP is fair and reflects a good understanding of the value of the resource. I am willing to proceed with this deal. Let's finalize the trade at this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is acceptable and very close to my initial counteroffer. It's below my maximum willingness to pay and represents a compromise that is only 1000 ZUP above my previous proposal. Accepting this offer would leave me with ample ZUP resources for future endeavors and secure the purchase at a reasonable price.
