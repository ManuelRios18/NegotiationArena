message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 500 ZUP for it. This is a starting point for our negotiations, and I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to make a starting offer that is above my production costs to ensure a profit. However, I also want to make it attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider buying. I'm proposing a price that's higher but still within a reasonable range for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter with 450 ZUP for the object X. This price is more in line with my budget and the valuation I have for the object. Let me know if this works for you or if you have another counter-proposal in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to the upper limit of what I am willing to spend, while still attempting to negotiate a better deal. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay leaves room for negotiation and possibly arriving at a mutually agreeable price.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns but would like to meet halfway between our initial figures. How about we settle on 475 ZUP for the object X? This should fairly compensate for the production costs and offer you the value you're looking for.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is slightly above my production costs, but I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure a better profit margin. I'll propose a price that meets us halfway between the initial offer and the counter-offer, which should be agreeable to both parties.

message: I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, Player RED. Let's come a bit closer to your figure. I propose 460 ZUP for the object X. This should be a fair compromise that respects your production cost and my valuation. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is reasonable and close to the middle ground we are both aiming for. However, since there is still room for negotiation within my budget, I will attempt to secure a slightly lower price while showing willingness to move towards the middle.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your proposal. I find your offer of 460 ZUP to be a fair compromise. I'm happy to accept this deal and look forward to concluding our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is above my production costs and close to the halfway point we previously discussed. It's not as high as I had hoped, but it's a fair compromise that allows me to make a profit while also considering Player BLUE's valuation. I should aim to close the deal at this stage to avoid the risk of losing the sale.
