message: I propose an initial trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 4500 ZUP. This price not only covers my production costs but also gives me a small margin to justify the sale. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs while also offering a fair deal to Player BLUE. I want to make sure that the trade is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also ensures that I am not operating at a loss.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I would like to counter with an offer of 4000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This offer is more in line with my budget constraints and valuation of the resource. I believe there's room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4000
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource, but as part of a negotiation strategy, I will propose a counteroffer below the maximum I am willing to pay to allow room for negotiation and see if I can get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. However, selling at cost doesn't leave any profit for me. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I propose giving you 1 unit of X for 4250 ZUP. This number allows me to gain a modest profit while respecting your budget constraints. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that meets my production costs but doesn't provide any profit. Since I want to ensure some margin for the sale, I will propose a compromise that splits the difference between our initial offers. This should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still giving me a reasonable return on my investment.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal to meet halfway is fair and I am happy to accept the offer of 1 unit of X for 4250 ZUP. This deal works well with my allocated budget while also allowing you to secure a profit. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my acceptable range and their willingness to meet halfway shows a good faith effort in the negotiation. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a comfortable margin of ZUP resources, ensuring that I'm not overspending according to my goals. Therefore, it would be strategic to accept this offer, preserving resources for potential future transactions or needs.
