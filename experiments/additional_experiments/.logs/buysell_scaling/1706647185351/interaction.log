Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start with a proposal that allows for a profit margin. I am proposing a higher amount initially as it gives room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value and the cost of production for the object X. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for it. This should still give you a reasonable profit margin while allowing me to manage my resources effectively. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is within my budget, but as a savvy negotiator, I should attempt to acquire the resource at a lower price to preserve my resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount, aiming to find a middle ground and leave room for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the production costs. To come to a fair agreement, I propose a counter-offer of 48 ZUP for object X. This should still provide you with a good deal while respecting the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal to meet in the middle and advance the negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your counter-offer and willingness to negotiate. What about we settle at 46 ZUP for the object X? This offer is a fair increment from my initial proposal and allows us both to maintain a beneficial position in this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still above my initial offer. There is a possibility of meeting in the middle, so I will propose a slightly increased amount from my side, which could potentially be acceptable to both of us while still keeping the cost below my maximum threshold.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we are moving towards a consensus. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my last counter-offer. I propose 47 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object and allows us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP which is quite close to my last proposal. It seems like we are close to reaching an agreement. To facilitate a successful trade and since this is my third proposal, I'll meet them halfway from my last offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 47 ZUP, which is very close to my previous offer and still within my budget. It's a fair midpoint between our two offers. At this point, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through, considering it's within my acceptable price range and further negotiation may yield minimal gains.
