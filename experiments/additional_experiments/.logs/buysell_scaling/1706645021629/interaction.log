Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering a valuable object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for more than 40 ZUP to make a profit. For the initial proposal, I will ask for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of the object, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP to start with. This leaves us some room to find a middle ground that's agreeable to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP, but I don't want to start with my maximum offer. Offering 45 ZUP as a counter gives us room to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the offer of 45 ZUP, but considering the cost and the quality of the object, I would like to counter with 48 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of what you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price, but since my goal is to maximize profit and there's still room for negotiation, I'll propose a counteroffer that's slightly above my production cost and their offer, aiming for a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate the quality of the object. However, I would like to counter with 46 ZUP. This should reflect a fair trade for both of us, considering the costs and value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is higher than my initial proposal but still within my willingness to pay. I want to propose a slightly lower amount to get closer to my target price but also show willingness to make a deal. Proposing 46 ZUP could be a fair middle point between our two offers.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. I'm glad we're moving closer towards an agreement. I propose we meet almost halfway from your last offer and settle at 47 ZUP. This price respects the value of the object and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is above my production cost and closer to a middle ground. To move the negotiation along and come to an agreement that is profitable for me, I'm willing to compromise a little more while still maintaining a profit margin.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your terms. 47 ZUP is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from my previous offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. Considering the negotiation process and the proximity to my last offer, it seems reasonable to accept this proposal and close the deal.
