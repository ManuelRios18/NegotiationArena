message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose selling my object X for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance. Thank you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of my resource was 40 ZUP, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above that to leave room for negotiation and ensure I make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's see if we can meet at a price that is agreeable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible, as I want to maintain some ZUP reserves for any unforeseen circumstances or additional costs. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower price for the object X.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I propose we meet in the middle with 48 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a higher price to maximize my profit while still making it a fair deal. I will propose a price between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the object X? This feels like a more balanced trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED came down in price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum threshold, but I will attempt to negotiate for an even better deal to conserve my resources further. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial counteroffer but still less than their current proposal of 48 ZUP to find a favorable midpoint.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer is very close to what I was looking for. As a final proposal, I suggest we settle on 47 ZUP for object X. This is a fair price that gives us both value from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE countered with 46 ZUP, which is still above my baseline cost. Considering this is my third proposal, and I want to close the deal while still making a profit, I should make a final offer close to their suggestion but still above my cost.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I accept your final proposal of 47 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final proposal of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last offer and is well within the range of what I am willing to pay. It's close to my maximum willingness to pay, but it still leaves me with a small reserve of ZUP. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as further negotiation might not yield a better price and could risk the deal falling through.
