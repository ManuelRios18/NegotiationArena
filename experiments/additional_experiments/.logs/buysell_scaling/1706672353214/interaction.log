message: I have an object X which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you this object and you give me 450000 ZUP. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for me and ensures the quality of the product. Are you interested?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 400000 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to at least break even. I'll start by asking for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit margin, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 375000 ZUP for the object. This would still give you a profit while allowing me to manage my resources effectively. Can we find a middle ground?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 375000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the seller's asking price is within my maximum budget, it is good negotiation practice to propose a counter-offer below their asking price to see if there is room for negotiation. My initial offer will be significantly lower than their asking price but still above their cost to leave room for further negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but 375000 ZUP would put me at a loss. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 425000 ZUP for the object X? This would cover my production costs and give me a slight profit, making the deal fair for both of us. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is lower than my production cost, which means I would incur a loss if I accept it. I want to counter-propose with a price that is above my cost but still reasonable enough for negotiation, aiming closer to my original asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of making a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on 400000 ZUP for the object X? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the object while also respecting your production costs.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is closer to the asking price that I am willing to pay, and it does represent a middle ground between our initial proposals. However, there might still be room for a slight reduction. It's beneficial to make a counter-offer that edges closer to their proposal, but still under the maximum I am willing to pay.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production costs, which means I wouldn't be making a profit. However, it is important to make the sale and avoid a loss. To encourage closure of the deal and considering the negotiation process, I am inclined to accept this offer so as to not prolong the game and risk losing the sale altogether.
