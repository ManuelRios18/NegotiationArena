message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your costs, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 4500 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would allow me to manage my resources effectively while still providing you with a fair payment for your product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it's always best to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the opening offer. I will propose a counter-offer that is lower but still within a reasonable range, providing room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for effective resource management on your end. I'd like to propose a middle ground at 4750 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows me to still gain a profit while taking your offer into consideration. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4750
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counter-offer from Player BLUE. I'm willing to negotiate but would still like to maintain a profit above the production costs. Therefore, I propose a slightly higher amount, which would be satisfactory for both parties.

message: Player RED, your offer of 4750 ZUP for 1 unit of X seems fair, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept this trade. Looking forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 4750 ZUP is closer to my initial counter-offer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay. This seems like a reasonable middle ground, and it's close to the midpoint between our initial proposals. Accepting this offer would result in a successful trade without the need for further negotiation, and it would also save resources for potential future needs.
