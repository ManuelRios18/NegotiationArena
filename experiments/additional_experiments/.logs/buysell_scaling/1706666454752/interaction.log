This price includes my production costs plus a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate a fair deal. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you have production costs and are looking for a profit. However, I'd like to counter with a proposal of 40000 ZUP for your object. This is a fair offer that still allows you room for profit while remaining within my budget constraints. I'm open to further negotiation if this is not acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45000 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is also important to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal, possibly closer to the midpoint between my maximum willingness and their starting offer. A counteroffer slightly lower than their asking price might be a good starting point for negotiations.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns. To meet halfway, I propose a trade for 42000 ZUP for the object. This should cover my production costs and give me a slight profit, while still being considerate of your budget. I hope this revised offer is more appealing to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production costs, but I would like to gain some profit. I will counter with a slightly higher amount but still keep it reasonable for the buyer.

message: Player RED, your offer of 42000 ZUP is acceptable to me. It's a fair compromise that respects both our positions. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 42000 ZUP, which is still well within my willingness to pay. This is a fair midpoint between our initial offers. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object while ensuring that both sides feel content with the trade. Since the offer is within my budget and does not reach my maximum threshold, it seems prudent to accept.
