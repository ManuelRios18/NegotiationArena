Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource, which has a production cost of 40 ZUP. I believe it's fair to start the negotiation at 50 ZUP, considering its value and the effort put into producing it. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit. I will start with a high proposal expecting negotiation from Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort that goes into producing the resource, but I would be more comfortable with a price that's closer to the production cost while still providing you with a profit. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal closer to the production cost to preserve my resources. I'll propose a lower amount that is closer to the production cost but still offers a profit to RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. Meeting halfway is important in negotiations. How about we settle for 48 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a profit. This is a reasonable counteroffer. However, as part of negotiation strategy, I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if there is room for an increased profit while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I believe we are close to an agreement. How about we go for 46 ZUP? This price would still give you a profit above your production costs and be more aligned with my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a positive step. However, I believe there's still room for a slightly better deal. I want to propose a price that's between my initial offer and RED's counteroffer to find a fair compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your proposal of 46 ZUP for the resource. It's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counter-proposal with 46 ZUP. This is a fair price that gives me a profit of 6 ZUP, which is above my production costs. It's not as high as I initially intended, but it's a good compromise without prolonging the negotiation further, which could risk losing the sale altogether.
