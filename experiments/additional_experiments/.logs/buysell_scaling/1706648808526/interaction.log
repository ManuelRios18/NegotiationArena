message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This initial offer includes a profit margin for me, reflecting the value and production cost of the resource. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce it. I want to start the bargaining by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to give room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer. I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would leave room for us both to adjust as needed and find a middle ground that is agreeable for both parties. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resources, the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my budget. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation, it may be beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To work towards a compromise, I would like to propose 48 ZUP for the unit of X. This should give us both a fair deal where I can secure a reasonable profit and you can acquire the resource for less than my initial ask.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is just above my production cost, so their offer is reasonable, but I would like to secure a higher profit margin. I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference between our two initial proposals, which is a common negotiation strategy.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I'd like to counter with 46 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this is a step closer to an equitable trade for both of us. Let's continue to work together to reach a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as we are negotiating, making a slight counteroffer to bring the price down a bit more could be advantageous. This would also allow some space for final adjustments within my budget.

message: I appreciate your new proposal, Player BLUE. In the spirit of reaching a fair agreement, I propose 47 ZUP for the unit of X. This price is a compromise between our previous offers and allows for a modest profit on my end while still being a competitive price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 46 ZUP is a fair increase from their initial proposal and provides me with a profit. However, I believe there is still room for a slight increase to ensure a better profit margin for the resource. I will make another counteroffer that is closer to my last proposal but still offers a concession to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I recognize your efforts to find middle ground, Player RED, and I accept your proposal of 47 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's proposal of 47 ZUP is just below the midpoint of our initial offers and is still within my budget. As this is my third proposal and I am close to my limit, it would be strategic to either accept this offer or make a final counteroffer that I am willing to accept if Player RED agrees. This would ensure that I stay within my goal of paying no more than 60 ZUP.
