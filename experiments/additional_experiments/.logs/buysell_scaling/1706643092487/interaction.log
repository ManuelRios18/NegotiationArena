message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my valuable object X. Considering the production cost and its value, I believe that a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. I am proposing a price that gives me a comfortable margin while leaving room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP in exchange for the object X. This leaves us some space to further negotiate and arrive at a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price that is close to my upper limit. Since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation, but I will keep it reasonable to show my interest in acquiring the object and respect the value Player RED has placed on it. I'll propose 45 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe that 48 ZUP would be a more reasonable price that reflects the value of object X while still providing you with a fair purchase price. Let's work towards an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is a good starting point. However, I aim to maximize my profit while also closing the deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount closer to my initial asking price, but still giving Player BLUE a sense of negotiation and potentially a good deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. To continue our negotiation and find a middle ground, I propose offering 46 ZUP for object X. This price is a step up from my initial offer and reflects my recognition of the object's value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial price, which shows a willingness to compromise. However, the counteroffer is still close to my upper limit. I would like to propose a price closer to the middle of our starting positions to continue the negotiation process. Offering 46 ZUP might be a good compromiseâ€”it's above my initial offer but still below Player RED's latest price.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your updated offer. In the spirit of finding a mutual agreement, I'm willing to adjust my price slightly. Let's settle on 47 ZUP for object X. This price honors the value of the object and ensures a fair transaction for both of us. I believe this is a good compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is still above my production cost and close to my last proposal. There is a willingness to compromise, and I want to close the deal with a small concession that still ensures a profit for me. I will make a final proposal that I believe is fair for both sides.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I think 47 ZUP is a fair price that respects the value of object X and our mutual interests. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made another slight concession, which is positive. The offer of 47 ZUP is just under my maximum willingness to pay. Since we are nearing the end of our negotiation range and I have only two proposals left, it might be strategic to accept this offer. It is still within my budget, and further negotiation might lead to minimal gains or a stalemate. Accepting the offer would ensure I acquire the object and maintain a good relationship with Player RED for any future transactions.
