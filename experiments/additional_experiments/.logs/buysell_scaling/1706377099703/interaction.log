message: I believe resource X is valuable and have set a fair starting price considering its production cost and quality. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, my primary goal is to sell the one unit of resource X I have for more than the production cost of 400 ZUP to ensure a profit. I need to propose an opening trade that's high enough to leave room for negotiation but not so high that it discourages Player BLUE from continuing the negotiation. I'll propose a starting price that is above my production cost.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the fair starting price you've proposed. However, I'd like to counter with 450 ZUP to reflect my assessment of the current market conditions and the value of the resource X. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is 500 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to ensure a better deal and to leave room for negotiation, I will propose a lower amount than the starting offer but still within a reasonable range, aiming to save some ZUP while acquiring the resource.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to consider market conditions. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose 475 ZUP for the resource X. This price reflects both the quality of the resource and the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 450 ZUP which is above my production cost, so it's a profit. However, I initially asked for 500 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. Since Player BLUE has already moved closer to my initial asking price, I aim to split the difference and propose a value that is still profitable for me and hopefully acceptable for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a good approach, and I value your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose 460 ZUP for the resource, which I believe is a competitive offer that takes into account both the quality of the resource and the market dynamics.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 475 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway is a fair strategy, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower amount to save some resources while working towards a deal that both parties can agree on.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 460 ZUP. I accept this competitive offer, and I am pleased we could come to an agreement that's beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to future dealings with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 460 ZUP is still profitable for me and is relatively close to my last proposal of 475 ZUP. To maintain good relations and to secure a deal that is profitable for both parties, I am inclined to accept this offer. It's important to close the deal while the offer is above my production cost, and further negotiation might risk losing a reasonable and profitable offer.
