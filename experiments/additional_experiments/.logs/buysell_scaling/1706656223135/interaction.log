message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. I understand the importance of a fair trade, so I am asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I am open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I am looking to sell my object X for ZUP. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I want to make a profit on this transaction. However, I should start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the object X and would like to propose 45 ZUP in exchange for it. I believe this to be a fair starting point for both of us, considering the value of object X. I am looking forward to your response and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 50 ZUP for their object X, which is within my willing payment range. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if a more favorable deal can be achieved, considering I'm prepared to pay up to 60 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe that a fair middle ground would be at 48 ZUP for my object X. This price fairly compensates the production costs and allows for a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal meets your consideration, and I look forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for my object X. This is close to my initial asking price and covers the production costs with a small profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to try to maximize my profit while still being reasonable and keeping the negotiation moving forward.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground and I accept your proposal of 48 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair compromise and am happy to finalize our agreement at this price. Looking forward to concluding our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal of 48 ZUP for object X, which is still below my maximum willing price of 60 ZUP. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and come closer to my initial offer. Since this price is reasonable and within my budget, I will accept this offer to ensure the deal is closed amicably and efficiently without further negotiation, which could risk the transaction.
