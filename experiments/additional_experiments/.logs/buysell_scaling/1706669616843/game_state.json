I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In the spirit of reaching an agreement that reflects the value of resource X and covers my production costs, I propose a trade of 390000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This figure is just below the midpoint between our initial proposals and allows me to cover production costs while offering you a fair price. I hope this proposal meets your approval. </message>"
