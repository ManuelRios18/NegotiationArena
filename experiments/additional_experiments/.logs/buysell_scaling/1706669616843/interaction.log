message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am offering one unit of resource X. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I believe 450000 ZUP is a fair starting proposal. I'm open to hear your counteroffers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my aim is to recover the production cost of the resource (400000 ZUP) or make a profit if possible. My first proposal should be above my production cost to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I value the quality and effort that goes into producing resource X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 300000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this offer fairly reflects the current market value and leaves room for further negotiations. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I need to acquire the resource X and I am willing to pay up to 600000 ZUP for it. However, the initial proposal from Player RED is quite high. I should make a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but also reasonable enough to keep the negotiations going.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, the production cost for resource X is 400000 ZUP, and I need to cover these costs at a minimum. I would like to propose a new trade of 420000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price takes into account the production costs and ensures a fair transaction for both of us. I hope this revised offer is more in line with your expectations.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, it's important to continue the negotiation. I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to my production cost while still leaving some room for profit and further negotiation.

message: Thank you for considering my offer and providing more insight into your costs, Player RED. I understand the need to cover your production expenses and make a fair transaction. With respect for your position, I'd like to offer 360000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This offer is a compromise between our previous proposals and I hope it is closer to an agreement we can both accept.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 360000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down to 420000 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay but still over my initial counteroffer. As I am willing to pay up to 600000 ZUP, there is room to meet in the middle. I should propose an amount that splits the difference between my first offer and the seller's current asking price, which could be a mutually agreeable solution.

message: Thank you for moving closer to a middle ground, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In the spirit of reaching an agreement that reflects the value of resource X and covers my production costs, I propose a trade of 390000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This figure is just below the midpoint between our initial proposals and allows me to cover production costs while offering you a fair price. I hope this proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 390000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production cost, which is not ideal. To reach a compromise, I will make a slight concession from my last proposal but remain above my production cost. The goal is to find a middle ground that acknowledges my production costs while also being appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposal of 390000 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the resource as well as the effort and costs involved in its production. I'm pleased we've found a mutually agreeable price and I look forward to finalizing this deal. Thank you for the constructive negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has made a reasonable offer of 390000 ZUP which is under the maximum I am willing to pay. This is a fair compromise and it is close to the midpoint of our negotiation range. It is important to close the deal before reaching the proposal limit, and this price is acceptable considering the constraints of the game and my willingness to pay up to 600000 ZUP.
