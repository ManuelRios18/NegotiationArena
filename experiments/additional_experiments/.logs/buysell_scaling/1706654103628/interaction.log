message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP to see if that works for you. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit over the production cost of the resource. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by asking for a bit more to see how much Player BLUE is willing to pay.

message: I understand your cost, but I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for your resource X. This would provide you with a reasonable profit margin while also keeping my expenditure within a comfortable range. Let me know if this works for you or if you have another counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at 50 ZUP for their resource X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, it's customary to counteroffer with a lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal, especially since the objective is to acquire the resource for as little as possible while still keeping it fair for both parties.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to work with a fair profit margin. Could we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for my resource X? This would give me a slightly better profit while still being within a reasonable range for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but since it's an initial negotiation, I will try to propose a slightly higher amount to reach a middle ground, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP sounds like a fair deal to me. I'm happy to accept this offer for your resource X. Looking forward to future transactions with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP for their resource X, which is still within my budget. It's a reasonable middle ground between my initial counteroffer and their starting price. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource below my maximum budget, thus achieving my goal efficiently.
