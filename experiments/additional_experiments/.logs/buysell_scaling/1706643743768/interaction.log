message: I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a profit. I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price, considering the production costs and the value of the resource. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I will propose a trade that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'm starting with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand that you are looking to sell your resource X for a profit. While I appreciate that 50 ZUP covers your costs and provides profit, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. This amount is closer to the cost of production and still offers you a profit, while also allowing me to conserve some of my resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, but as this is a negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal. However, I will keep my offer reasonable and not too far from the asking price to maintain good faith in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. It's close to my production cost and I appreciate your consideration for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP. This would give me a slightly better profit margin while still being a reasonable price for you. Does 47 ZUP work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it still allows me to make a profit, but I will try to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable move towards compromise. This price is still within my budget and allows me to achieve my goal while ensuring that Player RED makes a profit. Accepting this offer seems like a fair trade for both parties and it will save us time from further negotiations.
