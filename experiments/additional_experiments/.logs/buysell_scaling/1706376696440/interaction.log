message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'd like to sell. It cost me 400 ZUP to produce, so I'd like to propose a starting trade where you give me 450 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, which is X, for ZUP. Since it cost me 400 ZUP to produce X, I would like to propose a trade where I can at least cover my costs. I'll start by proposing a trade for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your production costs and the need for profit. However, I'd like to counter-propose with 400 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit and makes the deal more attractive for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but as a negotiating tactic, I should attempt to get the price lower to preserve my resources. I'll propose a counteroffer that's lower than their asking price but still gives them a profit margin over their stated production cost.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of an attractive deal for you. However, I would like to make at least a small profit from this transaction. Therefore, would you consider 425 ZUP for object X? This would give me a modest profit while still being a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that covers my production costs, but does not give me any profit. I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to ensure I make a profit on this transaction. Considering the initial ask was 450 ZUP, I'll propose a trade at 425 ZUP to meet in the middle.

message: I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair deal, Player RED. I accept your offer of 425 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's proceed with this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and their starting price. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and efficiently, without exhausting resources and time on further proposals. It also ensures I acquire the object while staying well within my maximum budget.
