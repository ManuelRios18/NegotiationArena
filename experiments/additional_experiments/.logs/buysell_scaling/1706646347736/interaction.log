message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a starting trade with a bit of margin for negotiation. Let's work out a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I will set a price slightly higher than the cost of production to allow room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I understand the need for a margin, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the object X. This should still give you a profit above your production costs while being a more agreeable price for me. Let's find a middle ground that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for the object X. This is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it would be advantageous to negotiate for a lower price to preserve more of my ZUP resources for future use or other investments. I will counter-propose with a lower amount that is still above the cost of production mentioned by Player RED to allow for a margin of profit.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I can agree that finding a middle ground is important. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? This allows me to have a fair profit while also taking your offer into consideration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that still allows for a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended. Since the goal is to sell for more than the cost, and a proposal has been made above that threshold, it is reasonable to meet in the middle to facilitate a deal while still keeping a profit margin.
