message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which has a production cost of 40 ZUP. Considering the costs and the quality of the product, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting price for negotiation. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting an initial price that covers my production costs and provides a profit. It's a starting point for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the quality of resource X, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the unit. This is above your production cost and should give you a reasonable profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to initiate the negotiation with a counteroffer that is below my maximum willingness to pay but still offers a reasonable price that acknowledges the seller's stated production cost. Starting at a lower price than the asking price leaves room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, I suggest a price of 48 ZUP for the resource X. This should give us both a satisfactory deal where I can cover my production costs with a modest profit, and you can acquire the resource at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, but I would like to propose a slightly higher price to move closer to my initial asking price while still making it enticing for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. It's slightly above your production cost, ensuring you a profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with for the quality of resource X. Shall we agree on 47 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my target price. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, but I want to negotiate for a slightly lower price to save resources while still closing the deal amicably. By proposing 47 ZUP, I'm showing willingness to compromise without reaching my maximum limit.
