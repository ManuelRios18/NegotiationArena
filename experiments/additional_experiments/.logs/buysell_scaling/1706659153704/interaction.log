message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand you need to cover your costs and make a profit, but I was hoping we could find a more favorable price that works for both of us. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price is closer to my budget and would help me manage my resources more efficiently. I hope we can continue to negotiate and find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It's a reasonable starting point, but I believe there's room to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to aim for a better trade while keeping the conversation open.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose we meet halfway between our two offers. How about we settle for 47 ZUP for your 1 unit of X? This price still gives me a little profit while hopefully staying within your budget. I believe this would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am considering the counteroffer made by Player BLUE. It's below my initial asking price, but above my production cost. I want to propose a price that splits the difference, aiming to close the deal while still making a profit.

message: That sounds like a fair compromise. We both make concessions and still achieve our goals. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and potentially working together in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range. It's a fair middle point between the initial proposal and my counteroffer. It's important to secure the deal without dragging the negotiation on too long, especially since this price is under my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would be a good deal for me.
