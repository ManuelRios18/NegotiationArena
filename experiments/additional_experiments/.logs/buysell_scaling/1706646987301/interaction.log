message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose to sell it to you for 50 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit and ensures you acquire the valuable object X. Let's negotiate a fair price if this initial proposal doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal and I want to make a profit from the sale, I will propose a trade that gives me a reasonable return on my investment, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource. I will start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand that you want to make a profit, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for object X. This would still provide you with a profit above your production cost, and it would be a more comfortable price for me to pay. If this offer doesn't suit you, I'm open to further negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial proposal of 50 ZUP for object X is within my budget, I aim to negotiate a better price to conserve my resources and possibly allow for additional trading flexibility. I will propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground between RED's cost of production and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I propose we settle at 48 ZUP for object X. This price still gives me a reasonable profit and should be within your purchasing power. If this is agreeable, we can proceed; otherwise, I'm open to your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. I want to maintain a profit margin, but their offer is fair. I will counter with a slightly higher amount to meet halfway between my initial asking price and their offer. This allows for further negotiation but also shows willingness to close the deal.

message: Thank you for considering my proposal and offering a new price of 48 ZUP. I propose we meet a bit closer to my initial counteroffer with a price of 46 ZUP for object X. This price is a compromise between our positions and allows for a fair profit for you and savings for me. I hope this proposal is acceptable, but I am still open to discussion if necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is very close to the initial offer and still within my budget. However, I believe there is still room for a slight improvement in the deal for me. I will counter with an offer that is between my first proposal and RED's current proposal, which should be fair for both parties while still saving me some resources.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP. I find this to be a fair compromise for both of us. I accept this proposal, and I'm pleased to proceed with the trade of object X for 46 ZUP. I look forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new proposal of 46 ZUP, which is a slight increase from their previous offer. This is a reasonable compromise that still allows me to make a profit. I am inclined to accept this offer as it's quite close to my last proposal and will ensure a swift and successful transaction.
