message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of my resource X in exchange for 450000 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this does not suit your valuation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I would like to counter with an offer of 400,000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a bit below your asking price, but it leaves us room to find common ground that's beneficial for both parties. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
My goal is to acquire the resources at the best possible price, not to exceed 600,000 ZUP. The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve my ZUP while also reaching a mutually agreeable trade. I will propose a lower amount to open up the negotiation space.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at cost doesn't allow for any profit on my end. How about we meet halfway between our initial offers? I propose 425000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would give me a slight profit margin while still being fair to both of us. I hope this is a suitable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact amount it cost me to produce the resource, which does not account for any profit. I will counter with a price that gives me a profit while still being reasonable. Splitting the difference between our offers could be an acceptable compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a fair compromise that I am willing to accept. I agree to the trade of 425,000 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Thank you for this trade, and I look forward to any future dealings we may have.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The offer from Player RED is reasonable and still within my budget. By meeting halfway, we can both benefit from the trade without much back-and-forth, saving time and resources. It's close to my initial counteroffer, and it's important to maintain goodwill for potential future transactions. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a significant amount of ZUP for other endeavors.
