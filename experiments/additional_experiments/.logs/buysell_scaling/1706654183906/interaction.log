message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an item X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's quite valuable and would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X at a profit, considering production costs were 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production costs to open negotiations and see Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

message: I understand your production costs, but I'd like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP. This would cover your costs and give you a small profit, ensuring the deal is fair for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that is agreeable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, it's beneficial to try and negotiate a better deal to conserve resources. Proposing a lower amount could lead to a middle ground that is more favorable to me while still being acceptable to Player RED, considering the cost of production they mentioned.

message: I appreciate your offer to cover my production costs. However, I am looking to make a profit from this transaction. How about we settle on 43 ZUP? This would give me a modest profit and still be a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my costs completely with a 40 ZUP proposal. However, as I am looking to make a profit, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal, but still above my production costs. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale.

Turn: 1
message: I see that we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to offer 42 ZUP for the resource. This should give you a reasonable profit margin while also keeping the price within my budget. I hope this offer seems fair to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is closer to my initial counter-offer. It would be reasonable to meet in the middle from my initial proposal and their counter-proposal. I'll suggest a price slightly higher than my first offer, but still less than their current ask, to continue negotiations towards a mutual agreement.

message: Thank you for your offer of 42 ZUP. I think that is a fair price and I'm happy to accept it. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 42 ZUP which is a reasonable offer and gives me a profit of 2 ZUP. Since the negotiation is progressing smoothly and the offer is close to my last proposal, accepting this deal would ensure a profit without much further negotiation, which could risk losing the sale.
