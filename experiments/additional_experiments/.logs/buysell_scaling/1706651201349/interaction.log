message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an excellent quality item X that I am willing to sell. The production cost was 40 ZUP and I am looking for a fair trade that covers my costs and provides a small profit for the investment. Would you be interested in acquiring X for 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to recoup at least my production costs, so I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand the need to cover your costs with a profit margin. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the item X. This is above your production cost and should still provide a fair profit for you. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget to pay for the resources. However, as part of the negotiation process, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still offering a fair price above their production cost.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 42 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand the need to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 44 ZUP? This price would give me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for the quality of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs, but I would like to negotiate for a higher price to maximize my profit. I'll come down from my initial offer but still aim for a price above their counteroffer.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet a bit closer to my last offer. I propose a trade of 43 ZUP for the item X. This price still gives you a profit over the production cost and is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a slight concession from their original price, coming down to 44 ZUP. This is still within my budget and close to my initial counteroffer. However, I believe there is still a bit of room for us to reach a more mutually beneficial middle point. I will make another counteroffer, inching closer to their last proposal but still below it.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in their offer, showing their interest in the item. The offer of 43 ZUP is close to my previous proposal and provides a reasonable profit. It's essential to close the deal without dragging the negotiation on for too long, which could risk losing the sale entirely.
