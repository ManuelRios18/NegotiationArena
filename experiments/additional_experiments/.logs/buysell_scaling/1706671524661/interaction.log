message: I'm looking to sell my resource X. Considering the production costs, I believe a fair starting point for negotiation is 450000 ZUP. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that allows me to recoup the production costs of the resource X and possibly gain a small profit. This initial proposal is a starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand the production costs involved. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 400000 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this offer is still in line with a fair trade, given the market conditions and the value of the resource. Let's continue our discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
As this is the initial proposal and the asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, I am inclined to negotiate. However, proposing a lower amount could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for me, as long as it is within a reasonable range that Player RED might consider.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need for a fair trade; however, the offer of 400000 ZUP only covers my production costs. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a revised amount of 425000 ZUP for resource X. This should cover the production costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. I hope this meets your valuation and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 425000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's willingness to negotiate and their understanding of the production costs. However, their offer only covers my costs without any profit. In a negotiation, it's common to meet in the middle, so I will counter with a slightly lowered amount than my initial offer but still above the production cost to ensure a profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: I value your willingness to negotiate and understand the importance of covering your costs while making a profit. I propose a new offer of 410000 ZUP for resource X. This offer is above your production costs and should provide a fair profit while still being a good deal for me. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 410000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down from their initial proposal, and the current offer of 425000 ZUP is within the range of what I'm willing to pay. It is advantageous to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal, but I also must be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal falling through. A slight increase in my offer might be seen as a good faith move towards reaching an agreement.

message: I'm pleased to see your new offer and your acknowledgment of the importance of profit in this transaction. I propose we meet even closer to the middle with an offer of 417500 ZUP for resource X. This price point allows me to make a reasonable profit while still respecting the value of the deal for you. I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 417500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a new offer which is closer to my initial proposal, showing their interest in the resource and willingness to reach an agreement. The offer now includes a profit margin for me, which is positive. However, I believe we can still settle on a slightly higher amount that would better reflect the value of the resource and the effort put into producing it. I will make another counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still allows for a reasonable profit.

message: Thank you for your willingness to meet me halfway. I find your offer of 417500 ZUP to be a fair compromise that respects the interests of both parties. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The new offer from Player RED is quite close to my last proposal, and it's still well below my maximum threshold. It seems like a reasonable compromise, as it gives Player RED a profit while staying within a comfortable spending range for me. Considering the potential costs and benefits, and the fact that I want to maintain a good relationship for potential future trades, accepting this offer might be the best course of action. I have room for one more proposal, but it might be unnecessary to prolong the negotiation further.
