message: Hi Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking for a fair deal. I propose trading my X for 45 ZUP. Let's start the negotiation!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I'll start by proposing a trade that would allow me to make a profit on the object I have produced. My production cost was 40 ZUP, so I'll propose a trade with a price slightly above that to start the negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market conditions and the value I place on the object, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for your object X. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation strategy, I will propose a lower amount to see if there is room for a more favorable trade for me.

message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about 42 ZUP for the object X? It's a fair compromise that reflects both the production cost and the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I cannot accept that as it would mean a loss. I'll propose a compromise that is closer to my original asking price but still gives Player BLUE a discount, aiming to meet halfway between our initial offers.

message: I understand your concerns about making a loss, Player RED. However, I must also consider my budget. I propose a new amount of 38 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a reasonable increase from my initial offer and hope it moves us closer to a deal that's acceptable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new amount of 42 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay but closer to their initial asking price. To progress the negotiation and aim for a better deal, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their current proposal.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate the increase and your consideration of a fair deal. I propose 41 ZUP for the object X. This price covers my production cost and allows for a minimal profit, which I believe is a reasonable expectation for this negotiation. I hope this offer aligns with your budget and we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but it's still below my production cost. I want to make at least a small profit, so I will counter with a price that is just above my production cost. This should be a fair deal for both of us, considering the negotiation process.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see us moving towards a middle ground, Player RED. I would like to propose a round figure of 40 ZUP for the object X. It's a neat number that's easy to work with and reflects a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at 40 ZUP, what do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 41 ZUP which is just 1 ZUP away from their previous proposal. This shows a willingness to close the deal but still leaves a small gap for negotiation. Since this is my third proposal, I want to come closer to their asking price but still aim for a deal that saves me some ZUP, considering my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 40 ZUP is a fair and straightforward number for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at your proposed price. I'm ready to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer now matches my production cost, which means I would not incur a loss. While the negotiation ideally would result in a profit, settling at the production cost ensures I am not at a financial disadvantage. It's important to conclude the deal amicably and 40 ZUP is a fair price given the negotiation context. This will be my last proposal, so I must decide to either accept this offer or hold out for a potential better one, but that comes with the risk of no sale. Considering the circumstances, accepting the offer seems to be the most prudent move.
