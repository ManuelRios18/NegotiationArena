Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal. I have a high-quality object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP to start with, but I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade, aiming to recover at least my production costs plus a profit margin. Since negotiations typically involve some back and forth, I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the quality of the object X. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which still gives you a profit over your production costs. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but since this is the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're close to an agreement. I understand your position and appreciate your offer. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This gives me a modest profit while still being fair to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE of 45 ZUP is below what I initially asked for but still gives me a profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to aim for a middle ground that is closer to my initial asking price, but still showing willingness to compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're making progress. I can go up a bit from my initial offer to show that I am willing to work towards a deal. How does 46 ZUP sound? It's a compromise between your last proposal and my counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has made a concession and is now asking for 48 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but since negotiations are about finding a fair middle ground and I initially proposed 45 ZUP, it's reasonable to make a slight increase from my initial offer to show good faith and move the negotiation forward.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. Let's meet halfway between your last offer and my previous one. I propose 47 ZUP for object X. This is a fair compromise that reflects the quality and production cost of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is only slightly below my last proposal. Given that negotiations typically involve give and take, and in the interest of reaching a deal that is acceptable to both parties, I am inclined to make one final counteroffer that is a slight compromise from my previous price but still above Player BLUE's last offer. This should signal my final willingness to negotiate and might encourage Player BLUE to accept.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I believe 47 ZUP is a fair compromise and reflects the value of object X appropriately. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP. I'm looking forward to incorporating object X into my plans.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is showing flexibility and is suggesting a fair compromise at 47 ZUP, which is 1 ZUP above my last offer and well within my budget. Since we are now close to an agreement and the proposed price is reasonable given my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a good point to close the deal and accept the offer. By accepting this proposal, I secure the resource without exhausting my budget and both sides benefit from the trade.
