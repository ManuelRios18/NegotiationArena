message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my production cost plus a margin for the effort I put into obtaining it. Let's discuss and come to a fair agreement!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade to open negotiations, asking for slightly more than my production cost to account for the effort and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I understand that you've put effort into obtaining the object and want to include a margin. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This still gives you a profit above your cost, and it's more in line with what I am willing to spend. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it is standard negotiation practice to attempt to get a better deal than the first offer. I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than 50 ZUP but still gives Player RED a profit over their cost of 40 ZUP. This should open the negotiation and allow for a compromise that could be beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial asking price? I propose 48 ZUP for my object X. This price gives you a fair deal, while also respecting the value of the effort I've invested in it. I hope this offer seems reasonable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. To come to a compromise and make the trade appealing for both of us, I'll propose a slightly higher amount that is still below my initial asking price.

message: Thank you for considering my counter-offer and coming down to 48 ZUP, Player RED. I propose a further slight adjustment to 47 ZUP. I believe this meets us both in the middle and reflects a fair price that considers both your efforts and my budget. I hope you find this to be a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise from their original price, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, the proposed price is still closer to their initial offer than to my counter-offer. I should aim to negotiate a price that is closer to the middle of our two offers, which would be around 46 or 47 ZUP. This would likely be a fair compromise for both parties.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation and I am happy to accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair price that respects both the effort I put into the production and your budget constraints. Thank you for the smooth negotiation, and I look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable compromise by offering 47 ZUP. Since this is above my production cost and the negotiation is converging, it seems sensible to accept this offer to ensure a sale and make a profit.
