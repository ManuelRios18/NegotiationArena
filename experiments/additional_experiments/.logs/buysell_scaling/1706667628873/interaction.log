message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 45000 ZUP, which includes a reasonable profit margin for the transaction. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by asking for a price slightly above my production costs to make room for negotiation and to ensure I at least break even.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your need to make a profit. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 42000 ZUP, which should still provide you with a decent profit margin while being a bit more aligned with my budget constraints. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 45000 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always advantageous to negotiate for a better price if possible, keeping in mind the seller's production cost and my own budget. I will propose a lower amount closer to the production cost but still offering a profit to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget concerns. Let's meet halfway between our two figures. How about we settle on 43500 ZUP for the object X? This should give us both a satisfactory deal.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is slightly above my production costs. While it does provide a profit, I feel it's fair to negotiate for a higher amount to ensure a better profit margin. Meeting in the middle seems like a good strategy.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. I believe we're close to an agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 42500 ZUP for the object X. This offer should still respect your production costs and desired profit while being a bit more favorable for my budget. I hope you find this proposal fair.

my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer to meet halfway at 43500 ZUP. This is still within my budget and below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it may be possible to negotiate slightly further down to secure a better deal. I will make a second counteroffer that is above my initial proposal but still below Player RED's latest offer, maintaining a good balance between our positions.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 42500 ZUP for the object X as a fair compromise. I'm glad we could reach an agreement that respects both our positions. Looking forward to concluding this transaction with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is very close to the middle ground we were aiming for. It's slightly above my production cost and allows for a profit. It seems like a fair compromise and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal. Accepting this offer is likely the best outcome given the constraints.
