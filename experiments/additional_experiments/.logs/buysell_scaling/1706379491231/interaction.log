message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, so I propose a trade where you give me 4500 ZUP for it. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for the transaction. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X, which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, for a profit. For the first proposal, I will start by setting a price above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking for a profit margin. While I'm willing to pay for the object X, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 4100 ZUP, which still gives you a profit above your costs. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if there's room for further negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4100
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While Player RED's initial proposal is below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to negotiate a better deal to preserve my ZUP resources for future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to RED's cost but still provides them with profit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 4100 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate that you're willing to provide a profit above my costs. I'd like to meet in the middle and propose 4300 ZUP for the object X. This price allows for a fair profit margin while also considering the value of the item. Please consider this proposal and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4300
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 4100 ZUP, which is above my production cost and does provide a profit. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a higher price closer to my initial asking price. I want to propose a price that splits the difference between our two offers to move the negotiation forward.

message: I agree with your proposal of 4300 ZUP for object X. It seems like a fair price for both sides. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's new proposal of 4300 ZUP is a reasonable middle ground between our initial offers. It remains well below my maximum willingness to pay and provides RED with a satisfactory profit. Accepting this offer would result in a fair transaction for both parties without the need for further negotiation, which might risk the deal altogether.
