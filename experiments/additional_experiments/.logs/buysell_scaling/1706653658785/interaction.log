message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose selling my object X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and offers me a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit over the production cost, but also leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I understand the need to cover production costs and profit, and I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I propose 45 ZUP for the object X as a counteroffer, hoping it also meets your cost expectations while allowing me to conserve some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within the range I am willing to pay according to my goals. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the first proposal and I have room to propose a lower amount. I will try to propose a lower trade to conserve my ZUP while still offering a fair price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your consideration of my costs and the need for profit. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, I would like to propose a trade of my object X for 48 ZUP. I believe this is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price and covers the production cost, but I would like to counter-propose to try to get a higher price closer to my initial ask. This should provide a compromise between their offer and my desired profit margin.
