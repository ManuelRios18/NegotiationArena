message: I have an object X for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and make a fair profit. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the object X, plus a small profit margin. Considering the production cost is 40 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking to cover your costs and make a profit. However, I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for the object X. This would still give you a profit above your production cost, and it would be more in line with my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate to get a better deal, ideally closer to the cost of production. My goal is to pay less than 50 ZUP if possible, to preserve my resources for other potential transactions. I will propose a lower amount to see if RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and understand your budget concerns. Let's meet halfway between our initial offers. I propose a trade for 48 ZUP, which still provides you with a reasonable purchase price and allows me to make a satisfactory profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable counteroffer since it's above my production costs. However, I want to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit. I will propose a middle ground that is still advantageous for both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. Meeting halfway is a good approach. I'd like to counter-propose with 46 ZUP. This is a bit above my initial offer but still allows us both to benefit from the trade, giving you a profit and keeping the purchase within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it is still higher than my initial counteroffer. Since there's room for negotiation and I want to ensure a fair trade for both parties, I will make a second counteroffer that is slightly higher than my first, but still below Player RED's latest proposal. This should show my willingness to compromise while still working towards a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I value the negotiation process we're having. I see you've increased your offer to 46 ZUP. In the spirit of compromise and finalizing our deal, I'm willing to come down a bit more and propose 47 ZUP. This price ensures a fair profit for me and respects your budget. I believe this is a good balance for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly to 46 ZUP, which is a fair offer but still short of my last proposal. Since this is my third proposal out of four, I want to make a final offer that's close to my desired profit while still being acceptable to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. Your offer of 47 ZUP seems fair, and I'm happy to accept it. This deal respects my budget constraints and provides you with a deserved profit. Let's finalize this trade at 47 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to compromise, and their new proposal of 47 ZUP is only 1 ZUP away from my last offer. Considering I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and to maintain a good relationship for future transactions, accepting this offer could be beneficial. It is close to my target price and allows both parties to feel satisfied with the deal.
