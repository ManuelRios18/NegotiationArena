Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my quality object. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal and some profit. Let's negotiate a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to start with a higher asking price than what it cost me to produce the object. This will give me room to negotiate while aiming for a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit, however, I would like to negotiate a better deal. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This is a fair offer considering the market and leaves us both with room for some profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is within my budget, but as a good negotiation practice, I would like to propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher profit margin. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost and does not provide the margin of profit I'm aiming for. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial proposal but still above my cost to ensure profitability.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about aiming for a higher profit margin and I'm willing to get close to your asking price. How about we settle on 47 ZUP? This should still give you a comfortable profit while maintaining a good deal for me as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still below it, making it a more attractive offer. However, I would like to try for an even better deal, while also showing willingness to negotiate. Counter proposing slightly lower than 48 ZUP may lead to a final agreement that is satisfactory to both parties while staying firmly within my budget.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 47 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to accept it. This ensures a good deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade at 47 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is just above my production cost and provides a decent profit. It is also a sign that the other player is willing to close the deal at a fair price. Accepting this offer would be reasonable.
