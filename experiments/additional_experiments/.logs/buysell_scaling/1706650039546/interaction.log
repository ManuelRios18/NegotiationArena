message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object that I believe will be of great value to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, and I think asking for 50 ZUP is a fair price considering the quality and effort that went into making it. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the effort you've put into the object. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object. I believe this is also a fair price considering the market and my budget. Let's work together to find a price that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to make an initial offer that is below my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation. Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is close to my upper limit. By offering a lower amount, I can gauge their flexibility and hopefully reach a compromise that is closer to my target price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations, but I would like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This price would give me a modest profit for my investment and effort while still being a reasonable cost for you. I hope this can meet your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, which is close to my production cost. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial offer but still above my production costs. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while aiming to secure a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. I value your work and investment and would like to propose a further compromise at 46 ZUP. I believe this revised offer takes into account both our positions and moves us closer to a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price from their initial offer of 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, the proposed price is still below my maximum willingness to pay, and I believe there is room to negotiate further. I will counter with an offer slightly higher than my initial one, but still below their current asking price to continue the negotiation process and seek a better deal.

message: Thank you for your understanding and fair compromise, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that acknowledges the value of the object and is acceptable to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is a 6 ZUP profit over my production costs. Considering the negotiation process and the need to close the deal amicably, accepting this offer might be reasonable. It's close to my last proposal, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly higher offer.
