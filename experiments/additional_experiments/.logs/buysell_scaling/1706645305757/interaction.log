message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to propose a revised trade where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would allow me to manage my resources better while still providing you with a fair compensation for the resource. Let me know if this works for you or if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: Propose a trade with

my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better price closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing my maximum limit yet. Making a counteroffer lower than 50 ZUP will leave room for further negotiation while also respecting the seller's need for a profit margin.

message: Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to make another counteroffer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X.

reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still a little room for negotiation to try and secure a better deal, ideally closer to my initial counteroffer. I will attempt one more counterproposal to see if Player RED is willing to reduce the price further.
