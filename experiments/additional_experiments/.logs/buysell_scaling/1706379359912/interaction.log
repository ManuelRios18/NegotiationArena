message: I'm offering you this object which cost me 4000 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I'm asking for 4500 ZUP to cover costs and a small profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a trade based on the production cost of the object. I want to at least break even or make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the costs and your need for a profit. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 4200 ZUP. This still gives you a profit over your production costs, and it seems like a fairer deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my maximum willing payment of 6000 ZUP for the object. However, it's a good negotiation practice to propose a counter-offer to see if I can secure a better deal, especially since the object's production cost was disclosed as 4000 ZUP, leaving room for negotiation. My counter-offer will still provide Player RED with a profit, but also allows me to conserve ZUP for potential future transactions.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about 4350 ZUP? This should reflect a balanced deal, giving me a reasonable profit and maintaining the object's value for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to negotiate a price that's closer to my initial asking price while still making the deal attractive to Player BLUE. Splitting the difference between our offers could be a good compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 4350 ZUP is fair, and I'm pleased to accept this deal. It's a good compromise that benefits us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 4350 ZUP is a compromise between our offers and still below my maximum threshold. It's a reasonable middle ground that offers a fair profit to Player RED while respecting my budget. Accepting this offer will conclude the negotiation swiftly and satisfactorily for both parties, avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth and preserving resources for future transactions.
