message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 45 ZUP to cover my costs and receive a small profit. Are you interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I want to recover at least my production costs, I will propose a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your need to cover costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 42 ZUP for the resource X. This still gives you a profit over your production costs, and it would fit better within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource. However, it is always better to negotiate for a lower price if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept it, while still offering a fair price above their production cost.
