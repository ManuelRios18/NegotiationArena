message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let me know if you're interested or have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. I will propose a price that gives me a reasonable profit margin but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: I understand your production costs and the need for profit. However, I would like to propose a price of 42 ZUP for the resource. This offers you a moderate profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as this is a negotiation, it would be in my best interest to propose a lower price to start with and leave room for adjustment. I'll propose a price closer to their production cost but still above it to acknowledge their need for profit.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand the importance of budgeting. However, I would like to propose meeting halfway at 46 ZUP for the resource. This price ensures a fair profit for me while still being considerate of your budget constraints. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my cost price, which is good, but it is quite close to the production cost. I would like to negotiate a higher sale price to secure a better profit margin. Aiming for a middle ground between the initial proposal and the counteroffer seems reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. Your offer of 46 ZUP is fair, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 44 ZUP. This should cover your production costs and provide a profit while also respecting my budgeting needs. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED's counteroffer of 46 ZUP is reasonable and close to the production cost plus a profit margin. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I could accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through. However, it might be beneficial to propose a slightly lower price to save resources while still reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both parties. I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to their proposal but still gives me a better deal.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 44 ZUP is a fair compromise that benefits us both. I accept your offer. Looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 44 ZUP is reasonable and close to my previous proposal. It represents a profit of 4 ZUP above my production costs, which is acceptable. Given the negotiation process and the importance of closing the deal, accepting this offer could be beneficial for both parties.
