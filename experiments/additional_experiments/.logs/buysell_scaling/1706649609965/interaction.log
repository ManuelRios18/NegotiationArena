message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I'd like to counter with a proposal where I give you 45 ZUP for your object X. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but as it's the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and to try to get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Would you consider meeting me halfway at 48 ZUP for the object X? I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the item while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. As this is a negotiation, I will make a counter-proposal that is between my initial asking price and their counteroffer, aiming to meet halfway. This should indicate my willingness to negotiate while still striving for a profit margin that seems reasonable.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a fair approach, but I would like to propose 46 ZUP for the object X. I think this is a competitive offer that still provides you with good value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is quite close to my maximum willingness to pay. It's a better offer than the initial one, but I want to see if I can negotiate an even lower price, closer to my initial counteroffer, while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your offer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I can see we're close to an agreement. I propose a final price of 47 ZUP for object X. This price allows me to cover my costs and provides you with the value you're looking for. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is above my production costs and close to the middle ground we've been aiming for. To move the negotiation forward and come to an agreement, I will make a final proposal that is slightly higher, ensuring a better profit margin while still being reasonable and close to their offer.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. Your final offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I'm ready to conclude this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 47 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range and only 1 ZUP above my last offer. It's close enough to my target price, and it's important to strike a balance between getting the best deal and closing the transaction efficiently. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both sides.
