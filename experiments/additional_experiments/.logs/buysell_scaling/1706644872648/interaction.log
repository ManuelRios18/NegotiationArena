message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP to start the negotiations. Let's work out a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I will offer the resource X for an amount slightly above my production cost to open negotiations.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I understand you've spent 40 ZUP on production and are seeking a profit. I'm interested in acquiring resource X but would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP to start our negotiations. Looking forward to finding a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource and the initial asking price is 50 ZUP, I will propose a slightly lower amount to open up the space for negotiation and reach a more favorable price, closer to the middle of what I'm willing to pay and what Player RED is asking.

message: Thanks for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I'd like to meet you halfway between our two prices. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for resource X? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since there is room for negotiation and I want to make a profit, I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my asking price and their offer, aiming for a mutually acceptable agreement.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade for resource X at the price of 47 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP which is within the range that I am willing to pay. It is close to the middle ground between our initial offers and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it allows for a quick agreement that is beneficial for both parties without further haggling.
