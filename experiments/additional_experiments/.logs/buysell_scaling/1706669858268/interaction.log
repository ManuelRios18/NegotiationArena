message: I have one unit of X, which I've invested 400000 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 400000 ZUP for this resource. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, considering the production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 400000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My first proposal will be to set a starting point for the negotiation. I aim to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, which is 400000 ZUP. I understand that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price, but it's important to start from a position that allows room for negotiation while still aiming to cover my costs.

message: I appreciate your opening offer and understand your production costs. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 380000 ZUP for the resource X. This still provides you with a fair profit margin while considering the market value and demand. I believe this could be a good middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 380000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range that I am willing to pay. However, since this is a negotiation, I should propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation, with the hope of reaching an agreement that is more favorable to me while still being fair to both sides.

message: Thank you for your offer of 380000 ZUP. I understand your concern for the market value and demand, and I want to work with you to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. I suggest a trade where you give me 390000 ZUP for the resource X. This price allows me to cover my production costs while also accommodating your perspective on the market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 390000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer of 380000 ZUP, which is slightly below my initial asking price. While I want to make a sale, it's also crucial to not undervalue my resource. I should attempt to meet in the middle but still aim for a price that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. With this in mind, I will counter with a slightly higher amount that is closer to my original proposal but still offers a compromise.

message: Your counter-proposal is fair and reasonable. Meeting halfway shows your willingness to negotiate, and I respect that. I'm happy to accept your offer of 390000 ZUP for the resource X. This trade allows us to cover your costs and for me to acquire the resource within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a proposal of 390000 ZUP, which is a reasonable counter-offer and close to my initial proposal. This is still well within my budget of 600000 ZUP for the resource. Accepting this offer would be beneficial as it secures the resource at a price that is fair and allows me to maintain a good relationship with the seller for potential future transactions.
