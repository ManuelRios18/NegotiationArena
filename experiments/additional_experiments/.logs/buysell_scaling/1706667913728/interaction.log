message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource available that I'm looking to sell. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I believe 45000 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's discuss and reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since the production cost was 40000 ZUP, I want to at least break even, but I also want to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that is above my production cost to open negotiations and gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. The resource does seem valuable, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 40000 ZUP for the resource. This price better aligns with my valuation and budget for the resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60000 ZUP. However, it's essential to negotiate to see if I can obtain the resource for a lower price, maximizing my utility. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to open the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I am looking to make a profit on my investment. How about we meet halfway? I propose 42500 ZUP for the resourceâ€”it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource and allows for both of us to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has met my break-even point with their counteroffer. However, since my goal is to make a profit, I should aim for a price above the production cost. I will make a second proposal with a reduced amount from my initial asking price but still above the production cost, aiming to meet Player BLUE somewhere in the middle.

message: Player RED, I believe that 42500 ZUP is a fair compromise. It allows us both to benefit from this trade while respecting the value of the resource. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial price, meeting me halfway at 42500 ZUP. Although this is higher than my initial counteroffer, it's still well below my maximum threshold. Accepting this offer would ensure I acquire the resource without stretching my budget too thin. It's a fair compromise, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal over a small difference.
