message: I'm looking to sell my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This covers my production costs and gives me a reasonable profit. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that covers my production costs with a small profit margin to open negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I need to manage my resources carefully. I propose 45 ZUP for your resource. This is above your production cost, ensuring you still make a profit, and it's closer to the amount I'm willing to pay. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but there is room to negotiate for a better deal that is more favorable to me, without undercutting the production costs of Player RED. I aim to propose a slightly lower trade offer to see if we can meet in a middle ground that is still above their production costs.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. I'd like to counter with a price of 48 ZUP. This is a compromise that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that still allows for profit, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase the profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I think we're close to a fair agreement for both of us. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? This should give you a decent profit margin while respecting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial asking price, and the counteroffer is within my budget constraints, though it is close to the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. It could be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is made, but I will attempt one more negotiation to see if we can settle on an even lower price that is agreeable to both parties, yet still allows for a profit on Player RED's side.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a proposal that is still profitable for me. Given that this negotiation is coming to a close and that it is important to maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
