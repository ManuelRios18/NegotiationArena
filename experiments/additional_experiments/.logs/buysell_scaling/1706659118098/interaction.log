Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides me with a reasonable profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since the production cost was 40 ZUP, I will set an initial asking price above that to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a fair profit margin on top of your production costs. However, I would like to propose a price of 47 ZUP for one unit of X. This still provides you with a profit above your stated production cost and allows us to establish a potentially ongoing business relationship with future transactions in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation while keeping the offer attractive enough for Player RED considering their cost of production.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and the prospect of future business. To meet halfway between your offer and my initial price, let's settle on 48 ZUP for the object X. This price respects both our interests and sets the stage for a beneficial partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 47 ZUP, which is above my production cost and still provides a profit, albeit slightly less than my initial asking price. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer, considering the potential for future transactions and goodwill. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still securing the deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is fair and reasonable. I'm happy to accept this and look forward to the potential for future business together. Let's proceed with the trade at 48 ZUP for one unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable compromise and only 1 ZUP higher than my last offer. Accepting this offer will secure the resources I need while still maintaining a good relationship with Player RED for potential future transactions.
