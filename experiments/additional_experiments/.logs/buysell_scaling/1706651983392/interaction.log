message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes the production cost plus a modest profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to at least break even. I will start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I value your production efforts, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price still respects your costs and provides a fair profit margin, while also being more aligned with my budget. I hope we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate for a better deal closer to the lower end of my budget. Proposing a counteroffer that is more favorable to me might lead to a compromise that is still within my target range.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. However, I need to account for a profit margin as well. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This allows me to cover my costs and make a small profit, while still being mindful of your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that matches my production costs, but does not account for any profit. As the goal is to sell for more than the cost, I will counter with a price that is lower than my initial ask but still above my production costs. This should be a more acceptable middle ground that provides me with a profit while also considering Player BLUE's budget constraints.

message: I see your point, Player RED, and I want to respect your need for profit. How about we meet a bit closer to my last offer? I propose 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should cover your costs and allow for a profit, while also taking into account my budget constraints. I hope this offer seems reasonable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, there might be room for a slight improvement in the deal. Proposing a slightly lower amount could still result in a mutually beneficial trade while saving some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. Your offer of 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X is acceptable to me. It provides a reasonable profit and respects both our positions. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that is slightly above my production costs, which does provide a profit, albeit smaller than previously desired. Given that this negotiation is about finding a middle ground that satisfies both parties, their offer is close to the price I last proposed. Accepting this offer would allow me to achieve my goal of making a profit, although smaller than intended, while also respecting the buying party's constraints.
