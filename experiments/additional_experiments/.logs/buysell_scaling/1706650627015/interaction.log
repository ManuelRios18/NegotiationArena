message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a small profit margin for my investment. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to counter the offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that will allow me to recoup my production costs and perhaps make a small profit. Since I don't know Player BLUE's resources or willingness to pay, I'll start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you're looking for a profit on your investment. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This still gives you a profit above your production cost while being a bit more aligned with my budget. Please let me know if this counteroffer works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, this initial offer is within my acceptable range. However, it would be in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible, aiming to preserve as much of my ZUP resources while still acquiring the needed resource X. I will therefore counter with a lower offer that is above RED's cost of production but still below their asking price.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This would give me a modest profit while considering your budget constraints. Does this sound fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to my production costs. While I would prefer to get 50 ZUP, I need to consider the possibility that this could be close to their maximum budget. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to see if there is more room for negotiation. I will propose 47 ZUP as a compromise, still giving me a profit but potentially more agreeable for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I believe 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is a fair price that respects both our positions. I accept this trade. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price still falls within my maximum willingness to pay. Since the price is only slightly higher than my counteroffer and still provides me with a reasonable amount of ZUP to retain, accepting this trade could be favorable. It's important to consider the value of closing the deal promptly without overextending the negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through.
