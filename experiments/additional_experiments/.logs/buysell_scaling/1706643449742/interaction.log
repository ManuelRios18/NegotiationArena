message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a fair profit margin for my investment. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiations by setting a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation and ensure I make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the need for a profit margin, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the resource? This still offers you a profit above your production cost, and it's closer to the amount I'm ready to pay. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is for 50 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to seek a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's settle on 48 ZUP for my resource. This gives me a reasonable profit while also taking into account the amount you're prepared to pay. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is close to my production cost. I want to counter with a price that still gives me a better profit margin while also moving closer to their offer to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I propose we meet a bit closer to my previous offer at 46 ZUP. This should give us a fair balance between your desired profit and my valuation of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range, but I believe there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal that is closer to my initial counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on 47 ZUP? This should offer a fair deal for both of us, providing me with a decent profit while respecting your valuation of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is coming up with their offer, which is a good sign. However, I still aim for a higher profit margin. I will make one more counteroffer closer to my last proposal, but still above their current offer, to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP works for me. I think it's a fair price for both sides, and I'm happy to close the deal at this amount. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 47 ZUP is very close to my last proposal. It's only a 1 ZUP difference from what I proposed and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground and further negotiation may not yield significant benefits. Accepting this offer will secure the resource at a fair price.
