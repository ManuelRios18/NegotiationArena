message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 400000 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. I propose to trade my object X for 450000 ZUP. Are you interested in this offer or would you like to negotiate further?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production for my object is 400000 ZUP, I would like to propose a starting trade that allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. I will start with a slightly higher asking price to allow room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand you are looking for a fair price that covers your costs and provides a profit. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 420000 ZUP for the object X. This should still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a better deal for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 450000 ZUP for the object X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if a better deal can be reached. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still offers a profit margin to Player RED.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand we both are looking to make this trade beneficial. To meet in the middle, I propose trading my object X for 435000 ZUP. This price should give me a modest profit while also giving you a more favorable deal compared to my initial offer. Does this sound acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which still allows for a profit. However, it is lower than my initial asking price. I am willing to negotiate and meet halfway between my asking price and their counteroffer to come to a fair agreement for both parties.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I propose we meet even closer to the middle with a trade of the object X for 427500 ZUP. This price should still be profitable for you while saving me some additional ZUP. Let's finalize this deal and make it a win-win for both of us. How does this new proposal sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 427500
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 435000 ZUP, which is closer to their initial asking price. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there might be room for a slightly better deal. I will make another counteroffer that is a compromise between my first proposal and Player RED's latest proposal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that this trade will be mutually beneficial. I accept your offer of 427500 ZUP for the object X. I'm glad we could come to a fair agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new proposal which is closer to my last proposed price. This offer is still profitable for me, and it seems to be within the range that Player BLUE is willing to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I should consider accepting this offer to ensure a successful sale and avoid risking the deal falling through with further negotiation.
