message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP, considering the production costs and the value it offers. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit margin while leaving room for negotiation. I'm proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to see how much the Player BLUE is willing to pay and to gauge their valuation of the resource X.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the object, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP to take into account my budget and the other potential costs I need to manage. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable price range as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as with any negotiation, it's common practice to counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there is room for a better deal.

message: I appreciate your budget concerns, Player BLUE. Let's meet closer to the middle with a counter-offer of 48 ZUP. This price fairly reflects the value of X and also respects the costs I've incurred. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and still allows for a profit, although it's less than my initial asking price. I want to counter-propose with a slightly higher amount to aim for a win-win situation. This will show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a fair profit.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to the counter-offer of 48 ZUP, Player RED. It seems fair and respects both our positions. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget and very close to what I initially intended to pay. It is a reasonable compromise between my first offer and their starting bid. Accepting this offer would ensure I get the resources I need while maintaining a good relationship for potential future trades.
