message: I have an object X for sale. I have invested 40 ZUP into producing it and am looking for a fair trade. What do you think about 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit margin. This initial proposal is higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand you've invested 40 ZUP into producing the object. I'm interested in purchasing it and would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Considering my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource, the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, it's beneficial to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources for potential future transactions or needs. Therefore, I'll counter-propose with a slightly lower offer to see if there's room for a more favorable deal, while still keeping the offer fair and above the seller's invested amount.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for object X? This gives me a modest profit while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my asking price and does cover my costs with a slight profit. However, I would like to propose a middle ground to maximize my profit while still being agreeable to the buyer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I agree that 48 ZUP for object X is a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is slightly higher than my initial counteroffer but still within my goal range, which is to spend no more than 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the object while maintaining a margin of my resources. Negotiating further may yield a slightly better price, but there's a risk of the seller withdrawing the offer if they perceive it as unprofitable or unreasonable. Thus, I will accept the current offer as it is fair and meets my objectives.
