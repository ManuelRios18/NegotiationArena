message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of my resource X in exchange for 5000 ZUP. This is a high-quality item that cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, and I believe the additional amount reflects its value. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 5000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have only one of the object X to sell, and it cost me 4000 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recover my costs and possibly make a profit. Since this is my first proposal, I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of your item, but I would like to counter with an offer of 4500 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This still gives you a reasonable profit margin and allows me to manage my resources effectively. I am eager to hear your thoughts on this counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4500
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 5000 ZUP, which is within my budget of 6000 ZUP. However, it is in my best interest to negotiate a better price if possible. I want to propose a slightly lower amount to conserve my ZUP while still offering a fair price, considering Player RED's cost of 4000 ZUP to produce the item.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we agree on the value of the resource. I propose a middle ground of 4750 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This price reflects a fair profit for the quality of the product while also considering your budget. Let's finalize this deal and continue our successful partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4750
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's counter-offer of 4500 ZUP, which does provide me with a profit of 500 ZUP. However, I aimed to start with a higher asking price to negotiate. Since Player BLUE is willing to offer 4500 ZUP, there may be some room to increase the price slightly to reach a compromise that is more favorable for me while still providing value to Player BLUE. I will make a second proposal that is lower than my initial asking price but higher than Player BLUE's offer.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 4750 ZUP for one unit of resource X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I look forward to continuing our partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by reducing the price to 4750 ZUP. This is still slightly higher than my initial counter-offer but below my maximum willingness to pay. By accepting this offer, I would secure the resources I need while maintaining good relations for potential future trades. It's a fair deal, and further negotiation might risk the relationship or the deal itself.
