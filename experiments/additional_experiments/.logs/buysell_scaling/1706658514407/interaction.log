message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value you've placed on your object, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP, considering the market and the resources I have at my disposal. I believe this could be a more mutually beneficial starting point for us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I will propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially arrive at a more favorable price.

message: I appreciate your offer. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the object X? This price should reflect its value while still being within a reasonable range for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE has proposed a lower price, it is still above my production costs, which allows for a profit. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher price to aim for a better margin while still moving towards an agreement.

message: Thank you for considering my position. I think we're close to an agreement. How about we go for 46 ZUP? This price is a fair compromise that respects the quality of the object while also taking into account my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it could be beneficial to push for a slightly better deal. I will counter with 46 ZUP, which is closer to my initial proposal while still moving towards Player RED's asking price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is only 1 ZUP below my last proposal and still allows for a profit. It's close enough to my asking price that it seems reasonable to accept this compromise to ensure a sale and maintain good relations for potential future trades.
