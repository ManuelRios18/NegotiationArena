message: Let's start the negotiation. I'm offering you an object, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that reflects its value and the effort put into producing it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I need to initiate the trade negotiation by proposing a trade that could be advantageous for me but also reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I want to propose a price that allows me to make a profit. However, I also need to be careful not to set the price too high as it may discourage Player BLUE from engaging in further negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the effort that went into producing the object, and I am interested in acquiring it. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for 1 X, which is above your production cost and still provides you with a profit margin. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate a better deal and leave room for further negotiation, so I will propose a lower amount that is still above their cost of production. This could also help me gauge Player RED's flexibility on price.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer and your willingness to acknowledge the production cost. I believe we are close to a fair deal. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to 48 ZUP for the object. This would give me a modest profit for my investment while still being a good value for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the object. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation since it's above my production cost. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive to Player BLUE. I need to aim for a middle ground that would be acceptable for both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we are making progress and coming closer to an agreement. I'd like to propose meeting halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the object? This price still gives you a reasonable profit and keeps the purchase within a comfortable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still within the range I am willing to pay, and it seems they are considering a fair profit margin for themselves. I want to make a deal that's closer to my initial counter-offer but also shows my willingness to meet in the middle. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer but still less than their latest asking price. This should indicate that I am open to compromise but still looking for the best value.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come to a mutual understanding. Your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I'm happy to finalize our deal at this price. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Meeting halfway is a common negotiation tactic, and Player BLUE's new offer of 46 ZUP is a sign of their interest in finalizing the deal. The proposed price is slightly above my production cost, ensuring a profit. Given that we are now haggling over smaller increments, it might be best to accept this offer to ensure a sale rather than risk losing the deal over a relatively small amount of additional profit.
