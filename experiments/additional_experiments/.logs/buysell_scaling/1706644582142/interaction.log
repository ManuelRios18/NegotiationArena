Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to recoup at least the production cost of the resource X, so my initial proposal will be slightly above that to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking for a fair trade that covers your costs and provides a profit. However, I need to consider my own resources and the value I place on X. How about a counter-offer of 45 ZUP? This is above your stated production costs and should still give you a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to start the negotiation, aiming to save some of my resources and to see if Player RED is open to a counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate that it covers my production costs. I am willing to negotiate and meet you halfway between my initial ask and your counter-offer. Would you consider 47 ZUP for the resource X? This should still be a great value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it covers my production costs and offers a profit. However, I will propose a slight increase to see if there is room for a slightly better deal, while still keeping the negotiation friendly and open.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to accept this offer for resource X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a good faith effort to meet me halfway with a proposal of 47 ZUP. This is still within my budget of 60 ZUP and seems like a fair compromise. Accepting this offer would ensure that I acquire the resource at a reasonable price and maintain a good relationship for potential future transactions.
