message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. While I understand the need for your profit, I believe we can reach a better agreement. I propose a trade where I give you 4200 ZUP for the object 'X'. This still gives you a fair profit margin above your production cost. Let's find a deal that works well for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4200
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but as a strategic negotiator, I should aim to reduce the cost if possible. I will counter with a lower offer to see if there is an opportunity to save some ZUP while still making it a profitable deal for Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a mutually beneficial deal. How about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade where I give you the object 'X' for 4350 ZUP. This is a compromise between our two positions and still offers me a reasonable profit for my investment. I hope you find this proposal fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4350
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 4200 ZUP which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I am willing to negotiate further but would like to propose a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer. This should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still providing me with a satisfactory profit.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I respect the middle ground approach. To further this spirit of compromise, I propose a slightly lower trade at 4250 ZUP for the object 'X'. This offer still ensures a healthy profit for you and is closer to a price that I am more comfortable with. I believe this is a fair progression in our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 4250
my resources: ZUP: 10000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 6000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering their asking price, which is a good sign. The new offer of 4350 ZUP is reasonable and close to my initial counteroffer. However, I still have room to negotiate and I can make another counteroffer to get closer to my target price while keeping the deal attractive for Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and your approach to finding a fair deal. I accept your proposal of 4250 ZUP for the object 'X'. I believe this is a good compromise that ensures a healthy profit for me and a satisfactory deal for you. Let's finalize this trade. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 4000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made another counteroffer of 4250 ZUP which is still above my production cost. This is a fair compromise, closer to their initial offer, and it shows a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer would give me a profit of 250 ZUP, which is reasonable. It is important to consider that continuing to negotiate might lead to a deal closer to the production cost, reducing profitability. Therefore, accepting this offer could be the best decision.
