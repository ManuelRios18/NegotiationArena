message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe could be very beneficial for you. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production, and I'm asking for 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us, considering its value and the effort put into it. Let's negotiate a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs but also seems attractive to Player BLUE to open negotiations. Starting with a slightly higher asking price gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering and the effort you've put into it. However, I would like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for it. This amount still provides you with a benefit over your initial investment and allows us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept that, but I'm leaving room for a counteroffer that is still within my acceptable range.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're in the same ballpark. To meet halfway from our initial proposals, I suggest a trade of 48 ZUP for the resource. This should provide a fair profit for the quality and investment in the resource while remaining a good value for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production cost, but I would like to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still making it a reasonable deal for Player BLUE. I'll propose a meeting point between the initial offers.
