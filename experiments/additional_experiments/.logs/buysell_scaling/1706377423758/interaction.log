Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object X, which cost me 400 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and value, I'm starting the bid at 500 ZUP. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I aim to at least break even on the cost of production, but I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of the object, but considering I have to factor in my own costs and the potential for other opportunities, I'd like to propose 450 ZUP for the object. Let's work towards a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED is asking, to leave room for negotiation, but also keeping in mind the maximum amount I'm willing to pay which is 600 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 450 ZUP and understand your constraints. How about meeting halfway at 475 ZUP? This would allow us both to benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 475
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 450 ZUP is close to my production cost, but I'd like to aim for a slight profit. I'll propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial price and the counteroffer, leaning slightly in my favor.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I am close to accepting. However, I'd like to propose 460 ZUP to cover some additional costs on my end. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 460
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I am still within my budget, and this is a compromise that seems reasonable. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for further negotiation, but I must be cautious not to lowball too much and risk ending the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I believe your offer of 460 ZUP is reasonable and ensures a fair deal for both parties. I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 460 ZUP is above my production cost, providing some profit. It's slightly below my previous proposal, but it is a reasonable compromise. I will accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction and avoid potentially losing the deal.
