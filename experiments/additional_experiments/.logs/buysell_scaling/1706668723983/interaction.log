message: I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it at a slight profit. Would you consider a trade for 45000 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a starting point that allows room for negotiation but also aims to recoup the production costs.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking for a profit on your sale of object X. While I am willing to pay a fair price, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 43000 ZUP, which is still above your production costs and should provide you with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that's higher than their cost but lower than their asking price, aiming to reach a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the production costs and the value of object X, how about we meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price? I propose 44000 ZUP for object X. This should be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. It's below my initial asking price but still provides me with a profit. I am willing to negotiate but I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, ensuring a fair deal for both sides.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 44000 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 44000 ZUP, which is still within my budget. It's a fair midpoint between the initial asking price and my first counteroffer. Taking this deal would leave me with plenty of ZUP for future transactions and still under my maximum willingness to pay. It seems reasonable to accept this offer.
