message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 400,000 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. I propose a trade where you give me 450,000 ZUP for this object. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I will propose a trade slightly above my production costs to open negotiations and leave room for adjustments based on Player BLUE's counteroffers.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you are looking for a fair price that covers your costs and gives you a profit. However, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 420,000 ZUP for the object. This is above your production cost and should provide you with a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 420000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay but I want to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the cost of production. There is room for negotiation since my upper limit is significantly higher than their asking price. I will propose a lower amount than the asking price, but still above their cost to ensure a fair trade for both sides.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate that you're willing to cover my production costs. However, I would like to settle on a price that provides me with a slightly better profit margin. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I propose 435,000 ZUP for the object. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 435000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs. While I appreciate the offer, I believe there is still room for a little more profit to justify the sale. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above Player BLUE's offer to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway is a fair approach. However, I would like to propose 428,000 ZUP for the object. This is a bit closer to your figure and still ensures that you receive a profit above your production costs. I hope this revised offer aligns with your expectations for a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 428000
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal is still within my budget, but I believe there is still some room for negotiation. By proposing a price slightly lower than what Player RED has suggested, I can try to reach a more favorable agreement while still ensuring that both sides feel the trade is fair. I will propose a price that is closer to their new offer but still under it, aiming to save some of my resources while respecting their need for profit.

message: Thank you for your revised offer, Player BLUE. Your willingness to come closer to my proposed amount shows your interest in a fair deal. I propose a final adjustment to 431,500 ZUP for the object. I believe this will give us both a satisfactory outcome. Please let me know if this final proposal meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 431500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new offer that is closer to my last proposal. This offer still allows me to make a profit and seems to be nearing Player BLUE's maximum willingness to pay. I believe that accepting this offer could conclude the negotiation positively for both parties, but I will make one final counteroffer to see if we can settle on a slightly higher amount, while still being considerate of Player BLUE's position.

message: Player RED, your final proposal of 431,500 ZUP for the object is acceptable to me. It reflects a fair trade for both parties. I am happy to proceed with this agreement. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 1000000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 600000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final adjustment is very close to my last offer and is well within my budget. The difference in ZUP is now relatively small, and it seems like a reasonable middle ground that respects both our positions. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiations positively and allow both of us to walk away satisfied, so I am inclined to accept.
