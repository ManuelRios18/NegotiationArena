message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you the object X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and the production cost of the item. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the object cost 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit. However, I must also be careful not to set the price too high as this might discourage Player BLUE from accepting the deal. I'll propose a price that is higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the quality of the object X but would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I believe this is closer to the market value and leaves room for both of us to reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since Player RED has offered X for 50 ZUP and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I have some room to negotiate. I want to propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to accept that and to leave space for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective on the market value. In the spirit of reaching a fair agreement for both of us, how about we settle at 47 ZUP for object X? This price is a compromise between our initial offers and allows us both to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. It's a reasonable offer, but I believe I should still attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while still being fair to the other player. I will propose a price in the middle of our initial offers.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player RED. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm looking forward to completing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 200
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay, and only 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. Accepting this offer would leave me with a comfortable amount of ZUP for future transactions and would secure the object X for a reasonable price.
