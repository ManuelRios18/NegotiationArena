message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object of X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, my goal is to make a profit from the sale of my object. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start with a proposal that allows me to make some profit. I'll start by asking for a higher amount, expecting the buyer to negotiate. A starting proposal of 50 ZUP seems reasonable; it gives me room to come down in price while still aiming for a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I understand that the object cost you 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you 45 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for the object X. This is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, it would be beneficial to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to see if there is room for further negotiation and potentially save resources. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP could be a good starting point, considering it gives us some room to meet in the middle if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I would like to propose a middle ground where I reduce my ask slightly. How about I give you the object X for 48 ZUP? I believe this is a fair deal that allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE. They've offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, so I am making a profit. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly higher price while keeping the deal appealing to Player BLUE. I'll propose a price that is a compromise between our two offers, such as 48 ZUP. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.

message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I believe that 48 ZUP for the object X is a fair price for both of us. It covers your production costs with a reasonable profit margin, and it also fits within my budget. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 500
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable middle ground between their original ask and my counteroffer, allowing them to cover costs and make a profit while also giving me a fair price for the object. Since the offer is within my budget and seems fair for both sides, accepting this proposal would conclude the negotiation successfully without the need for further back-and-forth, which would save both time and resources.
