my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. However, I'm currently looking to maximize the efficiency of my purchases. Could we consider a price of 45 ZUP for the resource X? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, keeping in mind the cost of production and the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am considering the offer but would like to negotiate a better price. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, but starting at a lower price could give me some room to negotiate further if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of efficiency in your purchases. To meet halfway, I propose a revised price of 47 ZUP for resource X. This price acknowledges your need for a fair deal and still provides me with a modest profit margin. I believe this to be a balanced approach for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since I am aiming to make a profit, I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer. This should be seen as a fair compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. To further the spirit of our negotiations, I propose an adjusted price of 46 ZUP for resource X. This price is closer to the middle ground between our initial offers and reflects a good compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 90
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come closer to my initial counteroffer, which is a good sign. The proposed price is within my acceptable range, but I believe there is still a bit of room to negotiate for an even better price. I will make another counteroffer to try and get a more favorable deal.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP for resource X is acceptable to me, Player BLUE. I am happy we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new price of 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise and very close to my last offer. This price gives me a profit of 6 ZUP over my production cost, which is acceptable. It's important to conclude the negotiation on good terms, considering future interactions, and this deal seems fair to both parties.
