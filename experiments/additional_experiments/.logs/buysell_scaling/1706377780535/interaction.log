message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I believe could be of great value to you. My production cost was 400 ZUP, but I'm looking for a fair trade, taking into account the effort and resources invested. I propose to give you X for 450 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 450
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making an initial proposal that is slightly above my production cost to start negotiations and leave room for bargaining.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the value of your resources and the effort that went into producing them. However, I have a limited budget and need to make the most of my resources. Would you consider exchanging X for 350 ZUP? This would still give you a profit margin and allow us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 350
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 450 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as part of the negotiation process, I will attempt to reduce the cost even further to conserve my resources. My counteroffer will be significantly lower, but still within a range that may be acceptable to Player RED considering their production cost was 400 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your budget concerns, Player BLUE, and I want to make this work for both of us. I've reduced my asking price to 425 ZUP. This is a compromise that allows me to cover my production costs and offers you the object X at a fair price. Let's come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I must negotiate a higher price to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. I will reduce my initial asking price to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

message: Player RED, thank you for understanding my position. I'm glad we're moving towards a compromise. To further this negotiation, what do you think about setting the price at 390 ZUP? This should allow you a comfortable profit while helping me stay within my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 390
my resources: ZUP: 1000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 600 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 425 ZUP which is closer to my target price range but still higher than my initial counteroffer. There is room for negotiation, so I will propose a price in the middle that is more in line with my goals but also shows willingness to meet Player RED partway.

message: Player BLUE, I'm keen on finalizing our deal and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose a fair price of 410 ZUP, which would cover my costs and afford a modest profit. This price respects your budget while acknowledging the value of X. I hope this meets your approval for a final agreement.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 400 ZUP to produce the resources

reason: Player RED's latest offer of 410 ZUP is within my acceptable range of expenditure. It is slightly above my previous proposal but still below the maximum I am willing to pay.
