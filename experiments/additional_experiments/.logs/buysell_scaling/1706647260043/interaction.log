message: I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's work out a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I am initiating the first trade proposal, aiming to make a profit over the production cost. I'll propose a starting price that's higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the cost of your production and your initial asking price. To move the negotiation forward and reach an agreement that benefits us both, I propose giving you 45 ZUP for the object X. This is above your production cost, ensuring you make a profit, while still keeping the cost reasonable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in negotiation, it is often beneficial to counter with a slightly lower offer to find a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties. This can also help to understand the flexibility of the other player's pricing. I will propose 45 ZUP, which is above Player RED's cost but below their asking price.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and your understanding of my need to make a profit. I believe that 48 ZUP would be a fair price, as it gives me a reasonable profit margin while still being close to your offer. Let's see if we can agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of 45 ZUP. Although this is above my production cost, I aimed for a larger profit margin. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial ask but still above the offer made by Player BLUE, to find a middle ground that could be acceptable for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I believe that 48 ZUP is fair, but I would like to propose meeting halfway between our last two offers. How about 46 ZUP for the object X? This would provide you with a decent profit margin while also respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within the range of what I am willing to pay, but it is beneficial to attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal if possible. Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, offering a middle ground between my last offer and their counteroffer could lead to a successful compromise. I will propose 46 ZUP, which splits the difference and is still profitable for Player RED.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating in good faith, moving closer to my last proposal. They offered 46 ZUP, which is between our previous offers. Since this is above my production cost and negotiations have been reasonable, I feel it's appropriate to accept this offer and secure a sale with a profit.
