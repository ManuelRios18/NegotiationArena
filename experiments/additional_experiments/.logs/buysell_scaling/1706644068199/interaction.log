message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I believe 50 ZUP would be a fair price. Would you be interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell the resource for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Considering the production cost of the resource was 40 ZUP, I aim to at least break even or make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value of the resource, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for it. This offer takes into account both the production costs you mentioned and the market value, while also leaving me with some buffer in my resources. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but there might be room to negotiate a better deal for me. My goal is to acquire the resource for less than the maximum amount I'm willing to pay (60 ZUP) to maintain some ZUP reserves for flexibility. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, but still offer a price that is reasonable and respectful of Player RED's valuation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the production costs and market value. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would give us both a fair deal where I can cover my costs and you can acquire the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell the resource for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale by countering too high. I will propose a compromise that's closer to my initial asking price but still offers a discount.

message: That sounds like a fair compromise, Player RED. Let's meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. I accept your proposal, and I'm ready to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 60
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by reducing the price to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still within my maximum willingness to pay. This is a relatively small difference from my last offer, and accepting this deal would ensure that I secure the resource while still keeping some ZUP reserves. It seems like a fair middle ground that respects both parties' interests.
