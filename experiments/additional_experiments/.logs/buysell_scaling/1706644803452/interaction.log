message: I am looking to sell my high-quality resource X. Considering the production costs and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell X for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade where I can make a profit. I will start by asking for a slightly higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource X you're offering. To make it a win-win situation, I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This allows us both to have room for negotiation and ensures that we both walk away satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within the range of what I am willing to pay but it's always good to negotiate to try and get a better deal, especially since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. My first counterproposal will be slightly lower to leave room for further negotiation but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the resource X? This price ensures that I cover my production costs and also provides you with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. I want to make a profit, but I also want to secure a sale. Proposing a price slightly above their offer could lead to a successful negotiation, so I will counter with 48 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a good plan. To balance both our interests, I propose we go for 46 ZUP. It's a bit closer to your initial ask, and it still respects the value of your resource while being mindful of my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my budget. It's closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will make one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, while still keeping the negotiation friendly and open.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your consideration and the offer of 46 ZUP. I believe we are very close to an agreement. As a final offer, I propose 47 ZUP for the resource X. This aligns closely with both our interests and ensures a fair transaction. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase from their previous offer and gives me a modest profit. I want to close the deal but also want to see if I can secure a slightly better price. I'll propose 47 ZUP as a final offer, which is a minimal increase and should be acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your final offer of 47 ZUP for the resource X. It has been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I believe we have reached a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you for the constructive discussion.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 70
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 47 ZUP is very close to my last counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It seems like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource while respecting my budget constraints. I am willing to accept this offer to close the deal and ensure both parties are satisfied.
