message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40000 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 45000 ZUP, allowing for a fair deal and some profit for me. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an initial proposal, I want to start with a price that allows for negotiation but also aims to cover my production costs. I would like to propose a price slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation and also aim for some profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand the need for profit on your side. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 35000 ZUP for the resource X. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to discussing a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a lower price to move closer to my maximum willingness to pay without revealing it just yet. Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming to stay below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer, but selling at 35000 ZUP would mean a loss for me. To meet halfway and keep the negotiation moving forward, I propose 42000 ZUP for resource X. This price covers my production costs and allows for a modest profit, making it a more balanced offer. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, so I need to negotiate upwards to at least break even and ideally make a profit. Meeting in the middle would be a reasonable next step, which would be at 40000 ZUP. However, to maintain negotiation space, I will propose a number slightly above the middle ground.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I'd like to propose 38500 ZUP for resource X. This offer is a step up from my initial proposal and should help us find a middle ground. I believe this is a fair offer that moves us closer to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38500
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial asking price, which is a good sign. However, the offer is still above the midpoint between our initial offers. I want to move closer to a price that is more favorable for me but still shows willingness to negotiate. A counteroffer in the middle between my last offer and their counteroffer should be reasonable.

message: I appreciate your increased offer, Player BLUE. To continue our progress towards a fair deal, I propose 41000 ZUP for resource X. This price is just above my production costs, allowing me to cover expenses and maintain a viable business. I hope this proposal is closer to what you consider a fair middle ground.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has raised their offer, which is a good sign, but their proposal is still below my production costs. I should aim to at least cover my costs. I will counter with a slightly reduced amount from my previous proposal to show willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a small profit margin.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I can increase my offer slightly to 39750 ZUP for resource X. This amount is a fair compromise and should align with our mutual interests in finalizing this deal. I'm hopeful that this offer is acceptable to you and that we can conclude our negotiation on a positive note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39750
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, reducing their price to 41000 ZUP. While this is within the range I am willing to pay, I believe there is still room for a slight reduction to make the deal more favorable for me. I want to propose a price that is a compromise between my last offer and their current one, which would hopefully be acceptable to both of us.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we are nearing an agreement. I propose a final offer of 40000 ZUP for resource X. This matches my production costs and allows us to complete this transaction without any loss on my side. I believe this is a reasonable and fair conclusion to our negotiations. I hope you find this acceptable as well.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is very close to my production costs, and while it does not provide a significant profit, it does allow me to recover most of my investment. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a counteroffer, I will aim for a final proposal that meets exactly at my production cost to ensure that I do not incur a loss and to encourage closure of the deal.
