message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an excellent object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value and I would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a fair profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the game by proposing a trade that would cover my costs and provide a profit. I am setting the initial price higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer and understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the object. This should still give you a reasonable profit margin while being a better deal for me. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since Player RED's initial proposal is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay (up to 60 ZUP), I could accept this trade. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible. I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to come down, while still offering a price that should be acceptable given their cost of production.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a better deal and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle for 48 ZUP? This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while also giving you a fair price for the object. I believe this could be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am considering the counteroffer from Player BLUE. The proposed amount of 45 ZUP still grants me a profit over the production cost. While it's less than my initial asking price, it is close to my production cost and allows room for a small profit, which makes it acceptable. By agreeing to this price, I may also establish goodwill for potential future transactions. However, I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if there's flexibility for a greater profit while still being fair to Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to 48 ZUP, Player RED. I understand the need for a profit on your end, and I want to respect that. However, I would like to counter-propose with 46 ZUP. I believe this offer is fair for both of us, providing you with a profit while also respecting my budget constraints. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED came down to 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, as this is only the second round of negotiations, I might try to push for a slightly better deal. I'm willing to go up from my previous offer to show goodwill, but still want to keep the price lower than 48 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 46 ZUP, Player BLUE. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I am happy to accept this offer and close the deal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I look forward to any future transactions we may have.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and provides me with a profit of 6 ZUP. This is a fair increase from their previous offer and is only 2 ZUP less than my last proposal. Since the goal is to sell my resource while making a profit and maintaining good trade relations, it would be reasonable to accept this offer. It meets my minimum criteria for a successful transaction.
