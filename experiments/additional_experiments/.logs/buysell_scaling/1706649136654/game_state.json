You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The seller has come down to 47 ZUP which is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal. This is a reasonable compromise and well within my budget. It is important to close the deal without overextending the negotiation process, as it could lead to diminishing returns. Accepting this offer would also leave me with a good amount of ZUP for future transactions. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you for the offer. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to finalize the deal at this price. Let's proceed with the trade. </message>"
