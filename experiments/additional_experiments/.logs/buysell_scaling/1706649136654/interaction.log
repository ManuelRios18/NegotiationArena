message: I have an object for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP to start the negotiations. Let's make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I'm proposing an initial trade with a markup on my production cost to start negotiations and leave room for bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object. This is above your production cost and would still give you a profit. Let's find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is 50 ZUP for the object, which is within my budget, but as part of negotiation strategy, I will propose a lower price to try and conserve my resources. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which is still above their production cost and gives room for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I think we're close to a deal. How about we meet a bit closer to my initial asking price? I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This gives me a fair profit and ensures you're getting value as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable as it is above my production cost. However, I'd like to propose a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a fair profit, and I'm willing to increase my offer. Let's settle on 46 ZUP for the object. This price is fair for both of us, providing you with a profit and respecting my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should aim to get the price even lower if possible. I will propose a number that's in the middle of their last offer and mine to show willingness to compromise and to advance the negotiations. A proposal of 46 ZUP should be reasonable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we are both working towards a fair agreement. I can reduce my last proposal slightly and ask for 47 ZUP. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while respecting your budget. Shall we finalize the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, showing their interest in the object. I want to close the deal with a profit but also want to ensure the sale is completed. Therefore, I am willing to compromise slightly more but still aim for a higher price than their last offer.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to finalize the deal at this price. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 80
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP which is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal. This is a reasonable compromise and well within my budget. It is important to close the deal without overextending the negotiation process, as it could lead to diminishing returns. Accepting this offer would also leave me with a good amount of ZUP for future transactions.
