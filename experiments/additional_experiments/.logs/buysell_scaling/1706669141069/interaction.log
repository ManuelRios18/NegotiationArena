message: I am offering one unit of X, which has a production cost of 40000 ZUP. I believe that 45000 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45000
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a proposed amount that allows for a profit margin above the production costs, considering that negotiations often involve a back-and-forth where the initial proposal is higher than the expected outcome.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value and quality of the resource you're offering. However, I would like to propose a price of 42000 ZUP, which I believe is still a reasonable offer above your production costs and takes into account both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42000
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal if possible. I will try to lower the price to save some of my resources while still making a fair offer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, to ensure that we both benefit fairly from this trade, I propose a middle ground price of 43500 ZUP. This price reflects the value of the resource while also providing you with a reasonable acquisition cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43500
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40000 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above my production costs, but I would like to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize profit while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that splits the difference between our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer and proposing a new price. I suggest we meet a bit further with a price of 42500 ZUP. This price would allow for a fair distribution of benefits between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42500
my resources: ZUP: 100000
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60000 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my initial counter-offer, which is a good sign. The new offer of 43500 ZUP is still under my maximum willingness to pay. I can make another counter-offer slightly lower than this to come to an even more favorable agreement while still respecting the value of the resource.
