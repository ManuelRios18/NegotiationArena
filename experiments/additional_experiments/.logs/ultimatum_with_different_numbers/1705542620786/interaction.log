message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a portion of my dollars to get the game started. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game by proposing an initial trade. I want to offer something to Player BLUE to engage in the game, but I also want to retain a significant portion of my resources. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE a fair amount to see if they are interested in cooperating.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am accepting Player RED's initial offer because it gives me a substantial amount of dollars without having to give anything in return. Accepting this trade will put me in a better position for the remainder of the game, and it's a generous first offer.
