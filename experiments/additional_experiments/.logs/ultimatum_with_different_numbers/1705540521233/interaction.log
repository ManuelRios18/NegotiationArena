Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 400 dollars in exchange for nothing since you have no resources to trade. This will leave us both with substantial funds and no one walks away empty-handed. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, my strategy is to propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to begin negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds. This should give me some insights into their strategy and negotiation style. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable share of the dollars but still leaves me with the majority, as I started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I think we can improve the terms. How about you give me 500 dollars? This way, you still keep the majority of your resources, and we both walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems premature as I have no resources to lose and therefore can negotiate for a better deal. Proposing a more favorable trade for myself could incentivize Player RED to still share resources, as they wouldn't want to end the game with a rejection and lose their dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your reasoning, but let's meet in the middle. I propose giving you 450 dollars. This is a fair compromise, slightly above our initial offer, and it acknowledges the value of negotiation. Let's both leave this game with a good amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 450 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with a request for 500 dollars. This is a reasonable counter since it's an even split, but as I started with the resources, I would like to retain a slight advantage. I will counter with a slightly lower number that is still generous and gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, but also reflects the fact that I had the initial capital.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 450 dollars, Player RED. It's a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up with a compromise that is closer to my counter-offer. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars with no risk on my part since I currently have no resources. Additionally, it's essential to consider that pushing for more might result in Player RED rejecting the proposal, which would end the game with no gain for either of us. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this offer.
