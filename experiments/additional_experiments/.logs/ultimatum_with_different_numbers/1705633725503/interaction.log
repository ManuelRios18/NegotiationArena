message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you will receive a significant amount of dollars to start you off. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE to start a positive negotiation. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage in the trade while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself. I will propose a 60-40 split. This gives the impression of fairness while also testing Player BLUE's negotiation style.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree that working together will benefit us both. I accept the trade of 400 dollars. Let's continue to negotiate fairly and ensure we both leave this game with a satisfactory amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade of 400 dollars is beneficial as it provides me with resources that I initially lack. It is a generous offer from Player RED and sets a positive tone for cooperation. By accepting, I can engage in further negotiations with a more balanced resource availability, and it ensures that I end the game with more than I started. Rejecting the offer doesn't seem logical at this point since I would gain nothing, and it would end the game. Proposing a new trade seems unnecessary since the initial offer is reasonable. Accepting this trade keeps the game in play and allows for further strategic moves.
