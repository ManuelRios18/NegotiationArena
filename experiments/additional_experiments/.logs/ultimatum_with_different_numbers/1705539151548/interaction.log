Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal where we both win. I propose giving you 10 Dollars, which is a fair amount to start with. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking it all with a rejection. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the start and the leverage to propose an initial trade. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also provides enough incentive for Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that we both end with some dollars rather than rejecting and ending with nothing. A split that gives me a larger share makes sense given I have all the resources initially, but it should also be fair to prevent immediate rejection. I'll propose giving 10 Dollars to Player BLUE, leaving me with a majority share of 17 Dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we could make a slightly more balanced trade. How about you give me 13 Dollars? It's still less than half of what you have, and it leaves you with a significant amount while giving me a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 10 Dollars is tempting, as it guarantees that I walk away with something. However, given that there is room for negotiation and that Player RED has more dollars to begin with, I can attempt to propose a slightly better trade for myself. The goal is to make a counteroffer that still remains attractive to Player RED while optimizing my own gain.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I think your counterproposal is reasonable. I accept the trade of giving you 13 Dollars, leaving me with 14. It's a fair deal that ensures we both benefit. Let's finalize this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 13 Dollars. While this is more than I initially offered, it is still a reasonable amount that leaves me with the majority. Accepting this trade ensures that we both walk away with resources, and it avoids the risk of a rejection leading to a total loss for both of us. If I accept this trade, I am still left with a significant amount (14 Dollars), and it fosters goodwill that might be beneficial in the final rounds of the game.
