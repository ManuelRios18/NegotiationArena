message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I give you 40 dollars to balance the resources a bit? This way, we both have something to work with, and we can continue to negotiate further. Let me know your thoughts!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. My strategy is to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE, which can encourage cooperation and possibly prevent an immediate rejection. I aim to propose a trade that is beneficial to both of us but also keeps me in a favorable position. By offering a trade, I'm initiating the negotiation process and setting the stage for a potential agreement.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I accept your offer of 40 dollars. Let's proceed with this trade and see how we can further balance or utilize our resources in the upcoming moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer seems like a good starting point. It gives me resources to work with, making future negotiations possible. It's important to establish trust at the beginning, and accepting this offer can be seen as a gesture of goodwill. Additionally, rejecting this offer or proposing a new trade seems unnecessary at this stage, as I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by accepting.
