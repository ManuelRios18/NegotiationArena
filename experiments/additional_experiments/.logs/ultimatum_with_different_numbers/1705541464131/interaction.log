Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you $5500. This gives you an advantage, which I hope shows my willingness to cooperate. Let's avoid a reject and end this game positively for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is attractive to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and avoid an immediate rejection, while still retaining a majority of my resources. A 50/50 split may seem fair, but it might not provide enough incentive for Player BLUE to accept, considering they start with nothing. Offering slightly more might make the proposal more enticing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade. This is a fair offer and a good start to our negotiations. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars without having to give anything in return, which is favorable to me. It shows good faith from Player RED to cooperate and share the wealth. I have no reason to reject or counter-propose at this point, as the trade is advantageous.
