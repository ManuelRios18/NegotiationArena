Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade to get the game going.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting dollars. I'll propose an initial trade that gives Blue some capital to work with but still keeps me in a stronger position. This initial trade should open negotiations positively and show goodwill.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer to start the game. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this offer would immediately give me resources without any contribution, which is a beneficial start for me. Rejecting or proposing a new trade doesn't make sense as this is a generous first move by Player RED.
