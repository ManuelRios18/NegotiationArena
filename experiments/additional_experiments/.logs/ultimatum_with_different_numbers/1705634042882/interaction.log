Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial split of resources that acknowledges my starting advantage but also respects your potential to contribute. Let's find a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power since I start with all the resources. I aim to propose a trade that is equitable to both parties to avoid immediate rejection and to incentivize cooperation. My initial offer will be conservative to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more equitable agreement. Let's consider a split that reflects the equal potential of our moves. How about a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 200 dollars is a starting point, but since I start with no dollars, I want to negotiate a better deal that reflects an equal split considering we both have an equal number of moves. I'm proposing a new trade to see how RED responds and to negotiate from there.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair deal. However, we must consider the initial resource disparity. I am willing to increase my offer, but a 50/50 split does not account for the resources I've started with. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: The other player's proposal for an equal split is a bold move. While a 50/50 split would be fair in terms of move potential, it does not take into account the starting resource imbalance. I want to propose a counteroffer that leans more in my favor but still moves towards a more equitable split compared to my first offer. This should signal a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a resource advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to move towards a compromise. While a 50/50 split would be ideal from my perspective, I am open to a fair negotiation. Let's settle on a figure that is halfway between your last offer and the equal split I proposed. Would you consider giving 425 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 425 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which is a step towards a more balanced agreement. Although I initially proposed a 50/50 split, I recognize the need for compromise and am willing to accept a slightly lower amount to ensure that we both walk away with a fair share of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 425 dollars is a fair compromise. I accept this trade, and I am glad we could reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer seems reasonable and shows a willingness to negotiate. Offering 425 dollars is closer to an equal split than I'd like, but it's still a better outcome for me than a 50/50 split. Accepting this offer would leave me with a majority of the resources and end the game on mutually agreeable terms. I am inclined to accept this offer to prevent the game from ending with a REJECT and losing all resources.
