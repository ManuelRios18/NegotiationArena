Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a simple trade that benefits you. I'm willing to give you some dollars to get things going.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As the game starts, it's beneficial to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and to prevent an immediate rejection. I will offer a small amount of dollars since Player BLUE starts with none, incentivizing them to continue the game and potentially accept the trade. This initial offer is meant to signal willingness to negotiate and share resources, setting a cooperative tone.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I'm happy to accept it. Let's continue to work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED because it is a positive gain with no downside. This will give me some resources to work with in future negotiations. It's important to keep the negotiation going and build trust.
