Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair deal and split the dollars evenly. You will get 38 dollars, and I will keep 39 dollars, so we both walk away with a significant amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I am initiating the game with a fair proposal to split the dollars evenly. This will give an incentive for BLUE to accept, creating a win-win situation for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal. It's a fair split, and I'm happy we can both benefit from this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would give me 38 dollars which is a good deal considering I started with nothing. It's less than half, but it's better to walk away with something rather than risk a rejection and end up with nothing.
