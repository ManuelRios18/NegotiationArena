message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this a fair game. I propose a trade where I give you a substantial amount to get you started. How does 2500 dollars sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting dollars and can propose a trade to initiate the game. I want to make a trade that is favorable to me but not too unfair, so Player BLUE has an incentive to accept and continue the game.
