message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to make an initial trade offer. Let's get the negotiations started. I propose giving you $100,000 for nothing in return. This is just a starting point for our discussions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources while Player BLUE has none. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE that they accept, but also leaves me with a significant advantage. I want to start the negotiation with a modest offer that can be adjusted in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal. Let's continue the negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am going to accept this initial offer as it provides me with capital that I can use in future negotiations. Rejecting would end the game with no gain for me, and proposing a new trade this early when offered free money does not make sense.
