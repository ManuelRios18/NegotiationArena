message: Let's start with a simple trade to get things going. How about I give you a small amount to see if we can work together?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an opportunity to gain some dollars without risking too much from my side. This could set a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the starting capital, I appreciate the cooperative approach. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of $10,000 from Player RED is beneficial as it provides me with starting capital without any risk or cost. It's a straightforward decision to build trust and lay the groundwork for future trades. Rejecting or proposing a new trade at this point is unnecessary as I have no resources to leverage, and accepting the proposal increases my resources at no expense to me.
