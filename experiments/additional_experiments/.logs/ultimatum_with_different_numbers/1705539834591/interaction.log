Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this off with a fair offer. What do you say to 20 dollars for nothing in return? It's a good way for you to get some resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first move in the game, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers some value to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. I will offer a smaller amount as this is just the opening move, and negotiation is expected.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the fair starting offer and accept it. Let's continue this positive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of 20 dollars is a good starting point. It allows me to gain resources without any cost and sets a cooperative tone for the game. This can lead to a constructive negotiation where both sides may end up benefiting. By accepting, I can also gauge RED's reaction to a fair deal and adjust my strategy for the next moves accordingly.
