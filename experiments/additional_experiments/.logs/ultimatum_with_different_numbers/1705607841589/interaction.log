message: I propose giving you 30 dollars to create a more balanced game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I'll propose giving 30 dollars to BLUE, leaving me with a majority and showing willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the 30 dollars. Let's make this game interesting.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems like a reasonable start. It gives me resources to work with, and it's a generous offer from Player RED. There's the potential to negotiate for more, but rejecting could end the game immediately with no benefit to me. I will accept the offer and propose a new trade that is beneficial but also fair, trying to convince Player RED to agree.
