message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade where we both can have an equal amount of resources. I'm willing to give you half of my dollars so we can both have equal opportunities in this game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start by proposing a fair trade to show goodwill and to attempt to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. I will propose giving Player BLUE 500 dollars, which is half of my resources. This is a generous offer and could help build trust.
