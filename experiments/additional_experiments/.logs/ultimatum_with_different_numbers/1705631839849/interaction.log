message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to kick things off. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to offer you a fair amount of dollars to get you started. How does $2,000,000,000 sound for a start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and therefore the power to propose a trade. I aim to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE, to encourage cooperation and to avoid an immediate rejection which would end the game with no benefit for either side. I will offer a substantial amount, but not too much, as I need to maintain a strong position and account for the possibility of further negotiations.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of $2,000,000,000 for nothing in return. It's a great start to the game, and I look forward to seeing how this progresses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer made by Player RED seems generous for a starting proposal. Accepting this trade would provide a significant amount of resources without any risk of immediate loss. It makes sense to accept this initial offer and gain a substantial amount of dollars, which could be beneficial for future moves. Rejecting or countering could lead to a complete loss of potential resources if Player RED decides to end the game on their next move.
