message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive a substantial amount of the dollars, ensuring that both of us benefit greatly. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: For the initial proposal, I want to offer a fair split to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but Player BLUE may anticipate that I could offer more since I start with all the resources. Thus, I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor as an opening offer, which still gives Player BLUE a large amount of the resources and is better than the potential outcome of both of us ending with nothing.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with substantial resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems like an advantageous move for me since I start with no dollars. By accepting this offer, I gain a significant amount of dollars with no downside. There is no reason to negotiate further since the offer is already substantially in my favor, and attempting to negotiate could result in a REJECT from Player RED, causing both of us to lose everything.
