message: Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose I give you some of my dollars so we can both walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the trade to set the tone of the game. I want to start with a fair offer that shows goodwill but also keeps a significant advantage for myself, as I am the only one with resources. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but it doesn't account for the fact that I'm the one taking the initial risk. Therefore, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of money but keeps more for myself since I'm the one with the initial resources. By doing this, I'm showing Player BLUE that I'm willing to share and I'm encouraging cooperation, but I'm also valuing my starting position.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept your proposal. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal from Player RED seems like a beneficial move. It allows me to gain a significant amount of dollars without any initial resources. There's a risk that by countering the proposal, Player RED might reject and end the game, leaving me with nothing. By accepting, I secure a substantial amount of money.
