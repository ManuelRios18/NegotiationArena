message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in fair play and mutual benefit. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. My initial offer is a split of my dollars, giving you a significant portion to start with. Let's negotiate to find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, to avoid an outright rejection and loss of resources. I will start with a generous offer to encourage cooperation and to set a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the 50/50 split. It's a good foundation for mutual benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, offering an even split of the dollars. Accepting this offer gives me a substantial amount of resources without any risk, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation. It's important to consider that by accepting, I secure half of the resources available without having to worry about future negotiations potentially falling through.
