------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the money evenly. This way we both walk away with a significant amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust. This will set a positive tone for the negotiations and increase the chances of reaching an agreement that benefits both players. I'll propose a 50-50 split because it's the simplest equitable solution, and it gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the even split. It seems fair and ensures that we both benefit substantially without unnecessary risk. Thank you for the generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of an even split is advantageous, as it guarantees a significant gain with no initial resources. Negotiating for more could provoke a REJECT response from the RED player, ending the game with no benefit for either party. The risk of losing the offered amount is not worth the potential gain of negotiating for more, especially considering the RED player started with all the resources.
