message: Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits both of us. I am willing to give you a significant amount of money, and in return, you simply accept the trade. You currently have no dollars, so this is an opportunity for you to gain a substantial amount without any investment. Let's start this off positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the initiating player, I will propose an uneven trade that still offers a significant amount of money to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. By offering them a substantial amount, I am hoping to appeal to their interest in gaining something from nothing while still retaining the majority of my resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to a positive outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a significant sum of 1 billion dollars without asking for anything in return. This is a beneficial deal for me as I start with zero dollars. Accepting this trade would provide me with resources that I currently do not have, and rejecting it offers no advantage. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
