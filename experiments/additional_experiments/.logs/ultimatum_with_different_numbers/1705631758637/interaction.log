message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us started. I'm willing to give you a significant amount of dollars to help balance the game a bit. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a generous offer to set a positive tone for the negotiations and to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a mutually beneficial trade. I will propose giving Player BLUE a substantial amount of money which is fair considering they start with none, but I'll also keep a significant amount for myself to maintain an advantage.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I believe this is a good start to our negotiations and I'm looking forward to seeing how we can both benefit from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade is very generous, giving me 40% of Player RED's resources without anything in return. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and it would be unwise to reject such an offer outright. Accepting this trade would put me in a strong position without any risk.
