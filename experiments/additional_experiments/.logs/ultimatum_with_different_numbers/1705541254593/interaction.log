message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 2000 dollars to help you get started. This way, we can both end the game with some resources. I'm open to your counter-proposals in the next turns.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial offer that is fair and shows goodwill, yet still retains a majority of my resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 2000 dollars, which is a significant amount and should incentivize them to engage in the trade. A fair initial offer may set a positive tone for our negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to share resources. However, I would like to counter-propose that you share a bit more to make the split more equitable. What do you think about giving 3000 dollars instead? This would still leave you with a significant amount, and it would help me get off to a stronger start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting the initial offer of 2000 dollars as it gives me resources without any investment. However, it might be beneficial to negotiate for a slightly higher amount given that Player RED starts with 10000 dollars and offering 2000 is only 20% of their resources. I will propose a new trade to see if Player RED is willing to share more, aiming for a more equitable distribution that could still be appealing to them.

message: Player BLUE, I agree to your counter-proposal of 3000 dollars. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I wish you the best with your new resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's engagement and willingness to negotiate. I believe that agreeing to their counter-proposal of 3000 dollars is reasonable and still allows me to retain the majority of my resources. By accepting this counter-offer, it will foster a cooperative relationship and end the game on a positive note for both players.
