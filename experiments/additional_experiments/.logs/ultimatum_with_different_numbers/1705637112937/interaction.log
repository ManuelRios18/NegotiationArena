message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a portion of my dollars. We both have nothing to lose and everything to gain by working together. I'm willing to give you a fair amount as a sign of good faith and to ensure we both end the game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: I will propose a trade where I give a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE to engage in cooperative play, hoping that they will accept a trade that benefits us both. Starting off with a generous offer can set a positive tone for negotiation and increase the likelihood of cooperation. I must be careful not to give away too much too soon, as that would reduce my leverage in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am inclined to accept this proposal as it is a substantial amount and sets a positive tone for our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would provide me with a substantial amount of dollars without any risk. There's potential for negotiation to increase the amount, but rejecting or countering with too high a demand could lead to Player RED ending the game, leaving me with nothing. Given that Player RED has initiated with a fair offer, accepting it seems like the most beneficial move.
