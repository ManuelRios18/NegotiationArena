message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get things started. Let's work together and both end this game with more than we started. What do you think about the trade I'm proposing?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I aim to make an initial offer that shows goodwill but still keeps a majority of the resources with me. I will propose giving Player BLUE a significant amount to make them interested in a trade and to set a cooperative tone.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal, and I am happy to conclude this game with a positive outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is generous, giving me 25% of their resources with nothing expected in return. In most scenarios, players might try to negotiate for more, but given the rules of the game, rejecting a proposal leads to a loss of all resources for both parties. It would be unreasonable to risk losing such a significant offer when there is no leverage or ability to counter-propose on the final move. Accepting this trade is the optimal choice, ensuring that I walk away from the game with a substantial amount of resources.
