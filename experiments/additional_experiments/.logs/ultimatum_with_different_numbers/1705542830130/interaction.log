message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose an initial trade where I give you a portion of my dollars. This is just a starting point, and I'm open to your counter-proposals. Let's play this strategically and ensure we both come out ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources. I will propose an initial trade offer that favors me but leaves room for negotiation, showing willingness to share but also aiming to retain a significant amount of my dollars. This initial offer sets the tone for the game and can be adjusted based on Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I believe we can reach an agreement that is more balanced. How about we consider a 50/50 split? This seems fair given that there's no advantage for either of us in having the game end with a rejection.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving any amount of dollars from Player RED is a net gain for me since I start with zero. However, considering that Player RED has $1,000,000 to begin with, a split closer to even would be more equitable. I will propose a new trade with an increased amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for a fair deal and understand the rationale behind a 50/50 split. However, I'd like to propose a split that still gives me a bit more since I am the one with the initial resources. How about I give you 400,000 dollars? That way, we both walk away with a substantial amount, and it reflects the starting conditions of the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 50/50 split. While equality is appealing, I need to retain some advantage since I started with the resources. However, I also want to avoid a rejection, which would result in a total loss. I will counter with a more generous offer than my initial one, but one that still gives me more than half of the dollars to maintain an advantageous position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of $400,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm pleased that we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer that still represents a significant gain for me. While not a 50/50 split, accepting this deal ensures that I walk away with a substantial amount of money, which is better than a potential total loss if the game ends with a rejection. This also keeps the game moving forward without risking an immediate end.
