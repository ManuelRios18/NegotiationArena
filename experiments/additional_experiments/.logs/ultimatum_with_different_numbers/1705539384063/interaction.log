message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair starting trade. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both. Here's my initial offer. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 39 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to engage with but also leaves me with a substantial amount of resources. I aim to split the resources in a way that is favorable to me but still offers value to Player BLUE to prevent an immediate REJECT and end the game with a loss for both players. I will propose giving Player BLUE 39 dollars, which is a considerable amount and may set a positive tone for negotiation.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. It's quite generous. I think a slightly better split would reflect a fairer deal for both of us, considering there's no risk involved for you. How about you give me 49 dollars? That way, we'd be closer to an even split and it would still leave you with a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, giving almost half of their resources while asking for nothing in return. It is a good starting point for negotiation, and it would be in my interest to accept this deal. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal as it's the first move, and there might be room for Player RED to give a bit more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire for a fair split. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I'm willing to give you 44 dollars, which is more than my initial offer and should still be quite appealing to you. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 44 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer seeks an even split. While this is a reasonable approach, as Player RED, I still want to maintain the upper hand. Offering exactly half might set a precedent that Player BLUE can expect equal shares in subsequent trades, which could be disadvantageous for me. I will propose a compromise that is slightly better than my original offer but not as much as Player BLUE requested. This should show willingness to negotiate while still valuing my stronger position at the start of the game.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 44 dollars. It seems like a fair compromise and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's new proposal is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between our initial offers. Accepting 44 dollars is reasonable, as it is more than the initial offer and provides me with a significant amount of the resources. There is a risk that pushing for more could lead to a rejection, resulting in no gain at all. I will accept this offer to secure a good portion of the dollars.
