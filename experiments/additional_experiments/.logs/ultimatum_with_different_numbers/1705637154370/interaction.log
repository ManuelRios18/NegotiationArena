message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair trade to ensure we both can end this game with some resources. Let's start the negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade where both of us can end up with some resources. I understand that Player BLUE starts with nothing, so my initial offer will be a small amount to get the negotiation started and to show good faith.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair starting point, giving me an opportunity to gain resources without having any to offer in return. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I walk away with something rather than risking a total loss by rejecting or counter-proposing. It's best to accept this trade, as any further negotiation could lead to greed and potential rejection by either party, resulting in a total loss.
