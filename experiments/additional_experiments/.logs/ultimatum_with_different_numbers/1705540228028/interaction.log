Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair initial trade to get things started. What do you think about a 60-40 split? I believe it is a mutually beneficial deal that would give you a substantial amount of dollars to start with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also ensures that I retain a substantial portion of my resources. I will propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate and avoids an immediate rejection which would end the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate the fair start. However, considering that this is our initial trade and I am at a disadvantage with zero dollars, I would like to counter-propose a 50-50 split to ensure a balanced distribution. This way, we both have an equal stake and incentive to continue trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the initial proposal from Player RED. Since I start with no dollars, receiving 40 dollars would give me resources to work with. However, I could try to negotiate for a more favorable split, as accepting the first offer could suggest that I'm content with any deal. By proposing a counteroffer, I might be able to secure a better trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counter-proposal of a 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I am glad we can agree on a balanced distribution. I believe this sets a good foundation for our interactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a 50-50 split. Although it is more generous than I initially intended, agreeing to this split could foster goodwill and increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting the trade without further negotiation, which could risk a rejection and end the game with no benefit for either of us. A 50-50 split is still a favorable outcome considering that I am in the position of power with all the initial resources.
