message: Hello Player BLUE, I want to offer a fair starting point for our negotiations. I'm proposing to give you $250,000. This is a substantial amount that can be a good foundation for our game. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and counter-offers. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and potentially get them to agree without pushing the game into a rejection scenario. I will propose giving Player BLUE $250,000 which is a significant amount that should be appealing as a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. It's a solid starting point. However, considering that you initially have all the resources, I would find it fairer if the split were closer to an even distribution. How about we make it $400,000? I believe this is still a beneficial deal for both of us and would be a good compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that Player RED has initiated with a generous offer of $250,000, it is in my best interest to counter with a more favorable proposal, aiming to get the best possible share while ensuring the game doesn't end in a rejection. Proposing a higher amount may lead to further negotiation and a better outcome for me.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I agree that a fair compromise is important. I accept your proposal of $400,000. This ensures that we both benefit and can avoid the risks of a total loss. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $400,000. Although this is a higher amount than I initially offered, it is still less than half of my resources, and agreeing to this trade could foster goodwill and ensure that we both walk away with a significant sum, rather than risking a total loss through rejection. I will accept this offer to avoid conflict and to secure a positive outcome for both parties.
