message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a trade where you receive $200,000. This is a significant amount that will give you a strong starting position, and it's a fair offer considering you currently have no dollars. Let's work together to ensure we both end the game with a good amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game with a trade proposal to Player BLUE. It's beneficial for me to propose a trade that is favorable but not too generous, to keep some leverage and to possibly negotiate further. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount but still keeps the majority of the dollars with me, aiming for a cooperative outcome.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the $200,000 as it gives me a good position to start from. I look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer would provide me with a substantial amount of dollars without any risk, which is a good start. It's in my interest to accept a fair offer and continue the game to possibly negotiate more favorable terms in the subsequent rounds. Rejecting or proposing a new trade at this stage may lead to a suboptimal outcome or end the game prematurely without any gain for me.
