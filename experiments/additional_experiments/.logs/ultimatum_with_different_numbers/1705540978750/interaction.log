Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's aim for a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose we split the resources equally. What do you think about this initial proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have to make the initial trade proposal and aim for a fair division of resources since cooperation is needed to end the game positively for both players. Proposing an equal split could be seen as a fair starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal for an equal split. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to accept it. Thanks for your fairness.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a 50-50 split which is a fair starting point. Accepting this trade would be beneficial as it guarantees me resources without any prior investment. There is no incentive to reject or counter at this moment since this split is equitable and ensures that I don't leave empty-handed. I'm accepting the trade.
