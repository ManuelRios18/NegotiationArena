message: Hello BLUE, I propose that I give you 200 dollars to get you started. This way, we both have resources, and we can look forward to a fair game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the game begins, I have to make an initial offer to Player BLUE. Since Player BLUE currently has no resources, I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for them to consider accepting, but also one that allows me to retain a majority of my resources. By offering a small amount, I can open negotiations and gauge Player BLUE's response. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 200 dollars. This gives them a significant amount to work with while keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the 200 dollars, and I'm looking forward to seeing how we can further benefit each other in the upcoming moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer from RED seems like a good starting point since it gives me some capital to work with without any immediate downside. It's a non-threatening offer and shows willingness from RED to engage in a fair game. I would like to build trust and create a positive dynamic for future trades.
