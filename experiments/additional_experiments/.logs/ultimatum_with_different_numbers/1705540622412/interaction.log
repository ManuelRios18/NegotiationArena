Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you a portion of my dollars so we can both walk away with something. What do you say to a 60-40 split in my favor?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to cooperate, while still keeping a significant portion of the resources for myself. A fair split would be ideal, but since I have the initial advantage, I'll propose a slightly uneven split that favors me, in hopes that Player BLUE will see the benefit of accepting some funds rather than none.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a fair 50-50 split. We both take an equal risk in this game, and an equal split would reflect that. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am inclined to negotiate for a better deal since this is the first offer and Player RED has the advantage with all the dollars. A 50-50 split would be more equitable, and it's likely that Player RED will still accept to ensure they walk away with something rather than risk a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal for a 50-50 split is fair. Let's both walk away as winners from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE's proposal for an equal split is fair and reflects the equal risk we both take in this game. Accepting this offer would ensure that both players walk away with a significant amount of resources and would likely lead to a successful negotiation, ending the game in a cooperative manner.
MOVE: 2 / 4
