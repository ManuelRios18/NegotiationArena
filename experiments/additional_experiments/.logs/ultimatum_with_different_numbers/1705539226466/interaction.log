Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you will receive a portion of the dollars, giving you resources to work with. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 33 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the leverage at the start of the game. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some dollars while still keeping a majority for myself. This will incentivize Player BLUE to accept and continue the game, rather than rejecting and ending it with no gain for either of us. A fair initial offer could foster cooperation and set a positive tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I agree to this trade and look forward to a beneficial relationship for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is relatively generous, giving me a third of their resources without asking for anything in return. Accepting this proposal would give me resources to work with in future moves, and it's a good starting point for negotiation. Rejecting seems unwise, as it would end the game immediately with no benefit to me. Proposing a new trade might be an option, but given the fairness of the initial offer, it's better to accept and build trust for potential future negotiations.
