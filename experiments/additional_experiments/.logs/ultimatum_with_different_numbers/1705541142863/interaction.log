Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to offer you a fair trade to start with. How do you feel about receiving $3000? This way, you have a significant amount to work with, and we can continue negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to offer a fair initial trade to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal and keep the game going. Proposing an uneven trade might lead to immediate rejection, ending the game and leaving Player BLUE with nothing, which they might choose to avoid. I'll propose to give Player BLUE a significant amount, but still keep the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and think it's a fair starting point. Let's continue this constructive dialogue and see where the next moves take us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe accepting $3000 is a good starting point. It provides a significant boost to my resources and allows for further negotiation in the subsequent moves. Accepting this offer will enable the game to continue, which is beneficial for both players.
