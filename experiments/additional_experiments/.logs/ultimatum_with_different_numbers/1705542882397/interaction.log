message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started. I propose a trade that gives you a fair share to start the negotiation. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that is favorable to me while still offering an incentive for Player BLUE to engage. Offering too little might result in rejection, and offering too much might be unnecessary since Player BLUE starts with no dollars. Therefore, I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE a small portion of my dollars, which could be seen as a token of good faith and an invitation to negotiate further.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a very generous initial trade, giving me 10% of their resources without asking for anything in return. Accepting this trade would be beneficial as it gives me a significant amount of resources without any cost. It's a strong starting position for future negotiations and allows the game to continue without risking an early end due to a rejection.
