Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose a trade where you will get a good starting capital, and I still retain the majority. How about I give you $30 to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the RED player, I have the advantage with the initial resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for the BLUE player to consider accepting. The goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, if possible.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the $30 and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED gives me a beneficial position, allowing me to gain capital without any initial resources. This acceptance also prolongs the game and gives me leverage for future negotiations.
