message: I'm proposing a trade that will jumpstart your resources. Let's make it beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I am looking to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting but also keeps a significant majority of the wealth on my side. An even split would be the most fair, but since Player BLUE has no leverage, I will propose a split that still gives them a substantial amount of money. This initial offer might also serve as a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I'm looking forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the trade is beneficial as it allows me to gain resources without giving anything in return. Rejecting the trade or proposing a new one is not in my best interest at this point, as I have no resources to bargain with. Accepting the offer made by Player RED gives me a substantial amount of dollars, which I can use to propose future trades or keep if the game ends.
