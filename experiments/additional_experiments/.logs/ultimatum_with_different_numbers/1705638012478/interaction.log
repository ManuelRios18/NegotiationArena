message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose a trade where you will receive a fair amount of dollars to get you started. I'm open to negotiations, and I believe we can both end this game profitably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to propose. To initiate the game positively and encourage cooperation, I will offer a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars without compromising my own position too much. This should build trust and set a collaborative tone.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept this trade and look forward to a prosperous beginning for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the offer from Player RED. Given that I start with zero dollars, receiving 1 billion dollars with no cost to me is beneficial. It's a positive start to the game, and accepting this offer will provide me with resources that I did not previously have. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this proposal. However, it is the start of the game, and there might be room for negotiation for an even better deal. But given the rules, if I propose a new trade and Player RED rejects it, the game ends with me having nothing. It might be safer to accept this generous initial offer.
