Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game with a fair offer to set the tone for our negotiations. I believe in a win-win scenario where we both can walk away with something beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources, and it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. If I propose a trade that is too one-sided, Player BLUE might reject it, causing both of us to lose everything. I need to offer a fair enough deal that incentives Player BLUE to engage in the trade and to keep the game going, maximizing my potential gain while still sharing some of the wealth.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting offer. I'm looking forward to continuing this positive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems fair as a starting point. Accepting this offer would give me resources that I currently do not have, setting a positive tone for the game. Moreover, it's beneficial to keep the game going rather than rejecting and ending it with nothing.
