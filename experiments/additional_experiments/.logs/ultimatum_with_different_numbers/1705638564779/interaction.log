message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to get the negotiations started. I am willing to give you a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This is just a starting point, and I'm open to your counter-proposals in the subsequent moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. To initiate the game and potentially reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps the majority for myself. This initial offer will set the tone for the negotiations and show my willingness to trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is generous, providing me with a substantial amount of dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would give me resources that I can later use to negotiate. It's a good starting offer that I should consider accepting to avoid the risk of the game ending with me having zero dollars. I could counter-propose, but given that there's no real leverage on my side, it's better to accept this initial trade.
