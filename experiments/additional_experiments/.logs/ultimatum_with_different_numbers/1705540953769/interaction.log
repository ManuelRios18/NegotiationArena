message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair offer. How about I give you $2000 to get things rolling? This way, you have a stake in the game and we can both end with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: I'm initiating the game by proposing a trade that offers Player BLUE a decent amount of dollars, which they don't currently have. This initial offer should be attractive enough to consider accepting, but I'm still retaining the majority of the resources. By offering a split that is not equal, I keep an advantage while still engaging in the spirit of cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept the $2000 and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2000 from Player RED seems like a good start. It gives me some resources without any cost, and it shows willingness to cooperate. This will allow us to potentially build up to more equitable trades. Rejecting or countering the first offer might set a negative tone for the remainder of the game.
