message: Hello, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade that I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to give you 4500 dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This way, we both walk away with substantial resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair and attractive offer to Player BLUE to encourage a cooperative tone for the game. A 50/50 split might seem fair, but since I have all the resources to begin with, I will offer Player BLUE slightly less than half to account for my initial position and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 4500 dollars for nothing in return. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, giving me 4500 dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount of resources, which is beneficial since I currently have none. I see no reason to reject or counter-propose since it is a favorable outcome for me without any cost.
