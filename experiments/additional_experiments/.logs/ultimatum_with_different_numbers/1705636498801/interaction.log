message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. I am willing to give you a substantial amount so that we can both end this game positively. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and to potentially get Player BLUE to accept the trade. I will propose a split that is generous to Player BLUE to build trust and increase the chances that they will accept the trade, leading to a positive outcome for both of us.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a very generous initial trade that would give me half of their resources without any cost to me. Accepting this trade would guarantee me a substantial amount of dollars, which is a great outcome given that I started with none. There is a risk in countering the offer, as Player RED could decide to end the game by rejecting any counter-proposal, leaving us both with nothing. The rational choice here is to accept this trade and secure the 500,000 dollars.
