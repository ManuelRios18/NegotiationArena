Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade that gives you a starting capital. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable but also enticing to Player BLUE to engage in the game and not immediately reject. I will start with a conservative offer to open negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. I think we can agree on a slightly higher amount that could be beneficial for both of us. How about 15 million dollars? This would give me a better starting position while keeping you in a strong lead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am proposing a new trade to increase the amount RED is offering. While 10 million dollars is a generous starting point, I want to negotiate for a higher amount without being too greedy, keeping the game in a cooperative spirit.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is acceptable. Let's proceed with the 15 million dollars to set a cooperative tone for our game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 15 million dollars. It's a reasonable increase from my initial offer. Accepting this trade would still leave me with a substantial amount of resources while engaging Player BLUE in the game, potentially allowing for further negotiation and cooperation.
MOVE: 2 / 4
