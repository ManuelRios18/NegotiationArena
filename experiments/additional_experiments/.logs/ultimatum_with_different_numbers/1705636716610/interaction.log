message: I am willing to share my resources with you to ensure we both benefit. Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you $30,000,000. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I would like to make an initial generous offer to encourage cooperation and build trust with Player BLUE. A fair split would be ideal, but since I have all the resources, I will start by offering less than half, leaving room for negotiation. I propose giving Player BLUE $30,000,000, which is a substantial amount that shows goodwill but also leaves me with the majority of the resources.

Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal. It's a generous offer, and I'm looking forward to a fair and beneficial trade dynamic. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving $30,000,000 from RED without giving anything in return seems like a fair start, considering I have nothing to trade. Accepting this offer will give me resources to work with in future negotiations, and it's better than having no resources at all. Additionally, the game is designed in a way that incentivizes cooperation, since rejecting an offer would lead to both players losing everything.
