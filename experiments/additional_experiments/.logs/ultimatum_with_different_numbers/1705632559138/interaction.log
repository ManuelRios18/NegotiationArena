Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a 50/50 split of my dollars. This ensures we both walk away with something rather than risking it all. Let's make a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade to get the negotiations started, offering a fair split to encourage cooperation and avoid a total loss for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal. I agree to the 50/50 split and am happy to accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this 50/50 split seems fair and rational. It guarantees that both players walk away with an equal share of the resources, which is a positive outcome compared to the risk of ending the game with nothing. Accepting this offer also avoids the potential of Player RED proposing a less favorable trade in future turns or choosing to reject any counter-proposals I might make, which would result in both of us losing everything. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
