message: Hello, Player BLUE! I want to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I give you $20, so you have some capital to work with? This way, we can both end the game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources to start with, while Player BLUE has none. My goal is to come to an agreement that benefits me but is also attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I'll start with a conservative offer that gives Player BLUE some incentive to continue the game, but doesn't give away too much of my resources right away.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you, Player RED! I accept your offer of $20. Itâ€™s a good starting point for both of us. Let's continue this positive trading dynamic.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $20 is beneficial as it gives me capital to work with, and it's a non-threatening starting point that could lead to more favorable trades in the future.
