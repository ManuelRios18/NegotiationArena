Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that gives you some of my dollars to start with. Let's find a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As the starting player with resources, I would like to propose an initial trade that favors me but still offers some incentive for Player BLUE to engage and accept, leaving room for negotiation. By starting with a modest proposal, I can gauge Player BLUE's strategy and willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. Let's continue to find a fair balance in our trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 5 dollars from RED seems like a beneficial start for me as it gives me some resources without any immediate downside. It is also a sign of goodwill from RED, and accepting it might lead to more favorable trades in the future. It's too early to reject and end the game, and proposing a new trade might seem ungrateful or greedy at this point.
