Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair share to start this game. How about I give you 300 dollars to get us going? That leaves me with a majority but gives you a significant amount to play with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources and the goal is to end the game with a favorable split. A good starting point would be to offer a trade that gives BLUE some incentive to accept but still keeps a majority of the resources with me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I accept the 300 dollars. Let's see how we can both benefit from here on out.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer of 300 dollars is beneficial as it gives me a starting capital without any detriment. It's a reasonable offer that allows for future negotiations and doesn't put me at a significant disadvantage. Rejecting or counter-proposing at this point doesn't seem advantageous.
MOVE: 1 / 4
