message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you some dollars to get us started on a positive note. Let's try to find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 23 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and I'm happy to accept it. Let's continue this cooperative spirit and work towards a fair distribution of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade seems reasonable as it provides me with resources without any cost. This can serve as a foundation for future trades and negotiations. It's a generous offer from Player RED, and accepting it will positively set the tone for the game. By doing so, I also show goodwill towards Player RED, which might lead to more favorable terms in future proposals.
