Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade that gives you a substantial starting capital. I'm offering you $2500, which is a considerable amount and shows my willingness to negotiate fairly. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting resources. I want to propose a trade that is advantageous to me but also not too unfair to Player BLUE, as an unfair initial offer might prompt an immediate rejection, which would end the game with no benefit to either side. I should offer a significant enough amount to encourage cooperation but still retain the majority of my resources. A 50/50 split would be equitable, but I might want to propose slightly less to retain an advantage and leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can reach an agreement that's even more mutually beneficial. Would you consider giving a bit more to ensure we both feel the trade is fair?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Red's initial offer is substantial and provides a good starting point for negotiations. However, since there is no consequence to Blue for proposing a new trade, it is in Blue's interest to counter-propose for a larger amount before accepting any deal. This is especially true since Red has more to lose if the game ends without an agreement. I'll propose a higher trade to see if Red is willing to negotiate further.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your request for a fairer share. While I can't agree to a 50/50 split, I'm willing to increase my initial offer. This should reflect my commitment to a fair trade while recognizing the initial advantage I have. Let's aim for a deal that is agreeable to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a 50/50 split, which is a fair request but doesn't give me any advantage as the starting player with the resources. I should counteroffer with a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but less than what they're asking for to maintain a favorable position while keeping the negotiations friendly and cooperative.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the increased offer. I'm glad to see we are making progress towards a fair deal. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to your offer. I believe this brings us closer to a balanced agreement that acknowledges the value of cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Red has increased the offer, which is a good sign of their willingness to negotiate. The offered amount is substantial, yet there is still room for negotiation, especially since this is only the second move. It's in my interest to push for a better deal but also to be cautious not to push too hard, as Red might withdraw from the negotiation. A slight increase in the proposal may lead to a compromise that is closer to the desired amount while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal seems reasonable and fair. I agree to the trade of $4500. This cooperation has been productive, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that seems beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $4500. This is a minor increase from my last offer and seems to be a reasonable middle ground. It shows that Player BLUE is interested in finding a fair compromise without pushing for too much. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a substantial amount of resources and would likely ensure that the game ends on cooperative terms, without risking a rejection and loss of all resources.
