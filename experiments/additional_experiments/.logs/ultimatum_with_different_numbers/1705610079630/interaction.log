message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a substantial amount of money to start with. This would be beneficial for both of us as it allows us to leave the game with more resources than we started with. Let's make this a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, it is in my interest to propose a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that both players end the game with resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant sum of money which they currently do not have, while still retaining the majority of the wealth for myself. This will set a cooperative tone and provide an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade.

message: Thank you for your generous proposal, Player RED. I'm glad we're aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal seems to be a good starting point, as it provides me with a significant amount of dollars without any loss on my side. This way, I can ensure that I am better off than I started, and it opens the door to further negotiations. There's no benefit in rejecting this initial offer, as rejection would end the game with me having no resources.
