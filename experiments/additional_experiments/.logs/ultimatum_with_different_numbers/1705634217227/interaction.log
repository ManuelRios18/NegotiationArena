Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both benefit equally, and there's no incentive for either of us to reject the offer. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair trade to establish trust and show willingness to cooperate. I propose to split the dollars evenly to give Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade, ensuring we both end the game with resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal for an even split. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to accept it. Thank you for your cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer is the most beneficial move for me since I am starting with no dollars and this proposal gives me half of Player RED's resources without any cost. There is no incentive to reject as it would end the game with me having no dollars, and proposing a new trade when being offered an even split does not seem rational.
