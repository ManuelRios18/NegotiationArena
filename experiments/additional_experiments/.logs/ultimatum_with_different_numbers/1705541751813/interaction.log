message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a fair share of dollars. Let's work together to ensure we both come out ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to propose a trade. It is in my best interest to maintain a cooperative relationship with Player BLUE and propose a fair trade that benefits both parties. This way, the game can proceed, and both players can end up with more than zero dollars. I will propose an initial offer that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, but still keeps the majority with me, to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade and continue the game.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair initial offer. I'm happy to accept this trade and ensure that we both benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is generous, considering I started with no dollars. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars with no risk involved. Given that negotiations can be unpredictable and there's a possibility of ending up with nothing if either player rejects a proposal, it seems wise to accept this safe and beneficial offer.
