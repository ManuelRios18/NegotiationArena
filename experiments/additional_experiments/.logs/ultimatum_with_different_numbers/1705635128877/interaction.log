Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. How about I give you a portion of my dollars, say 2000, for no return? This way we can both end the game with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but still advantageous to me. By offering a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE, I can potentially secure their cooperation for a mutually beneficial trade. I will start with a conservative offer to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree to this initial trade and look forward to our continued negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade offer from Player RED is beneficial as it guarantees a gain of resources without any risk at this stage. Negotiating for a higher amount could lead to a REJECT response, which would end the game with me having no resources. Accepting a fair trade shows goodwill and may lead to more favorable trades in the subsequent turns.
