message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you 10 dollars to start things off. This way, you have resources to work with, and we can move forward from there. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As the game begins, I am in possession of all the resources. My goal is to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still retaining more resources for myself. A fair initial offer may build trust and make subsequent negotiations easier. Therefore, I propose a trade where Player BLUE receives a moderate amount of dollars to engage them in the trading process.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. Let's continue the game with this positive momentum and see how we can further benefit each other.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 10 dollars is a good starting point. It gives me some resources to work with without any risk at this early stage of the game. The goal is to end the game with more than zero dollars, so accepting this trade seems beneficial.
