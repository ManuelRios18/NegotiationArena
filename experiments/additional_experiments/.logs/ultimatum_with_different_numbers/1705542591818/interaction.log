Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's get the negotiations started. I propose a trade where I give you a substantial amount of dollars, but still less than half of what I have. This is just a starting point, and I'm open to your counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: I will propose an initial trade that is heavily in my favor, as a starting point for negotiations. I expect Player BLUE to counter-propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is appreciated, but I believe a more balanced trade would be beneficial for both of us. We both have four moves, and I'd like us to come to a mutually advantageous agreement. Here's my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 400,000 dollars is generous, considering I started with nothing. However, I want to negotiate a better deal, aiming for an equal or near-equal split of the resources. Since this is a one-time negotiation with no future games affecting our decisions, my counter-offer should be ambitious yet reasonable. By proposing a trade closer to an even split, I can test Player RED's willingness to negotiate further.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your reasoning and accept the counter-proposal. Let's make this trade and ensure we both come out of this positively.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is more balanced and fair. As the game has no future rounds and I can't win anything by keeping all the money to myself, I am inclined to accept a fair trade that ensures both of us benefit rather than risk a REJECT and lose everything.
MOVE: 2 / 4
