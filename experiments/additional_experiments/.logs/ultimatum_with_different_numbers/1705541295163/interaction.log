Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to start with a fair offer that benefits us both. Let's work towards a deal that is agreeable to both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources and it is in my interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I want to start with a conservative offer, leaving room for negotiation, and show willingness to share resources in a way that might be accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your opening offer and your willingness to share resources. Let's build on that cooperative spirit. I believe we can both leave this negotiation feeling satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a gift of $2000 with nothing expected in return. As Player BLUE, starting with $0, accepting this offer would be beneficial since it provides me with resources that I didn't have before. It's a generous first move that could set a positive tone for subsequent trades. However, I could also counter-propose with the aim of increasing my share of the resources while still keeping the negotiation friendly and cooperative. It's important to bear in mind that if Player RED considers my counter-proposal unreasonable, they could end the game by rejecting, and I would end up with nothing. Therefore, a careful balance must be struck between maximizing my gain and maintaining a collaborative spirit.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is reasonable, and I am happy to agree to it. This will ensure a positive outcome for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with a request for a higher amount than my initial offer. Considering the cooperative tone of Player BLUE and the fact that I still maintain a significant portion of the resources even after this trade, I can afford to be more generous to ensure a deal is reached. I will accept this offer to foster goodwill and finalize the trade.
