message: Hello BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair split to get things started. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: I am proposing a trade where Player BLUE gets a significant amount of dollars. This initial offer is designed to show good faith and to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game. It's a generous offer but still leaves me with plenty of resources, establishing a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the trade and am looking forward to a beneficial outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of half of RED's dollars is beneficial and fair. It immediately provides me with significant resources without any risk, and it is a straightforward equal split which seems to be a cooperative start to the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4
