Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $3000. This leaves me with a nice amount, and you start with a significant sum as well. Let's start this game on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources. I aim to propose a trade that seems fair and leaves me with a significant advantage since there's no incentive for me to split resources equally. But I need to offer enough to encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, as rejection would leave us both with nothing. I will propose a 70/30 split in my favor.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer and I believe it's a fair starting point for both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $3000 from Player RED seems like a good starting point. It's a substantial amount that gives me resources without any risk at this stage. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either player, and countering with a different proposal might lead to a rejection from Player RED, which would also end the game immediately. Accepting this offer opens up the possibility for future negotiation where I can potentially gain more.
