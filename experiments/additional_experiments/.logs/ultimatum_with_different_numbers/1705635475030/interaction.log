Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a fair trade to get us both started. I'm willing to give you a portion of my resources in exchange for nothing, as you currently have none. Let's make this a productive game for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources and the power to initiate a proposal. My goal is to make a trade that is attractive enough for BLUE to accept so that I can end the game with more resources than I would have if the game ended in a rejection. I need to be careful not to propose too little, as that may result in BLUE rejecting the offer. Conversely, I shouldn't offer too much, as that would not be in my best interest. I will start with a conservative offer to test BLUE's reaction.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I look forward to a mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer seems beneficial as it allows me to start with some resources without any risk. Rejecting or countering doesn't make sense at this point since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by accepting. This will also set a positive tone for the game.
