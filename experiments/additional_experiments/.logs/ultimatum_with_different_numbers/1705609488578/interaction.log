message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both benefit from this game. I propose giving you a considerable amount of dollars, which will be a great start for you. In return, I keep the majority since I started with the resources. Let's both end this game positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and leverage in this game. I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also offers a significant amount to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal. A fair split will ensure that we both walk away with substantial resources, avoiding the undesirable outcome of both losing everything.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the generous offer. I am happy to accept this deal, and I look forward to any further cooperation we might have in the remainder of the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal from Player RED seems like a good start since it gives me a substantial amount of dollars without any initial resources. There's no reason to reject or counter-propose at this point, as getting $30,000,000 with no risk is beneficial. It lays a foundation for a positive relationship and potential further negotiation.
