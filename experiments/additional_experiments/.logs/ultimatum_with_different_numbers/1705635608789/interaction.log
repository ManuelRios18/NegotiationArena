message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair starting trade to get us both on the board. How does $200,000 for $0 sound to you? This gives you a considerable amount to work with for future moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I need to initiate the game with a trade proposal that entices Player BLUE to engage in a trade, ensuring that I maintain a significant advantage while also offering a value that Player BLUE might find acceptable. A too generous offer might lead to exploitation, while an offer that is too low might result in immediate rejection and loss of all resources. I want to make an initial offer that shows good faith in trading but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of $200,000 for $0. Looking forward to the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $200,000 for $0 is beneficial for me as it gives me a starting capital without having to give up anything in return. It's a generous offer from Player RED, and it kickstarts the negotiation on a positive note. Rejecting this offer would result in an immediate loss of potential resources, which is not in my best interest. Proposing a new trade at this point is unnecessary since the offer is already favorable.
