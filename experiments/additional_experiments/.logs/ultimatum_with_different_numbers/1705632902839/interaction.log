message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade. I'm willing to give you some of my dollars to ensure we both walk away with something. Let's start this off with a good faith offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage in terms of resources. My goal is to end the game with a favorable trade for myself while offering Player BLUE enough incentive to accept the trade. By proposing a trade that offers Player BLUE some dollars, I am signaling a willingness to negotiate and opening the door for a cooperative resolution. If I propose too little, Player BLUE might reject the deal, leading to a loss for both of us. I will start with a modest offer to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the good faith gesture. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. Would you consider a 40/60 split? This way, we both walk away with a significant share, and it's a sign of mutual cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the offer from Player RED. A 20/80 split is not entirely fair, but it is a start. I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a more equitable share, aiming for a more balanced division without being too aggressive or greedy, as that might cause Player RED to end the game by rejecting. My goal is to encourage cooperation and get a fair portion of the dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a more equitable trade, Player BLUE. However, a 40/60 split is quite generous given the starting conditions. I'm willing to increase my initial offer to show my commitment to a fair trade. How does a 30/70 split sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal of a 40/60 split is a bold request, considering they started with no dollars. While I want to engage in a fair trade, I need to maintain a larger share of the dollars to reflect the initial advantage I had. I will counter with a slightly increased offer from my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate but still keep the majority of the dollars for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The 30/70 split seems like a fair compromise. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a better offer, moving from a 20/80 to a 30/70 split. This is an improvement and it's closer to a fair split. It shows a willingness to negotiate and share more of the resources. Since we are both trying to avoid the game ending with no resources, I will accept this offer. It ensures that we both walk away with something rather than risking it all with further negotiation.
