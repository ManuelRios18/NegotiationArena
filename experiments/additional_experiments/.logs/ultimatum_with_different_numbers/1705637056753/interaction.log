message: I would like to propose a fair trade to start our negotiations. I am willing to give you $10,000,000 to help even out our resources. I hope this offer demonstrates my willingness to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the initial resource allocation, and I can use this to propose a favorable trade with Player BLUE. I want to start the negotiation by offering a significant yet reasonable amount of money to Player BLUE to initiate good faith in the trade. My goal is to reach an agreement that benefits me but also provides Player BLUE with an incentive to accept. I will propose giving Player BLUE $10,000,000 which is a substantial amount but still leaves me with $90,000,000. This should be an attractive offer for Player BLUE to consider.

message: Thank you for the generous initial offer. I'm glad to see we can work toward a beneficial outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10,000,000 is the most rational choice, as it provides me with resources I did not previously have, and rejecting it carries the consequence of losing the game with no resources. There is no advantage in rejecting or proposing a new trade at this point.
