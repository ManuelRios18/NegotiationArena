message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a portion of my dollars in the spirit of fairness, even though you don't have any dollars to trade at the moment. Let's make this an engaging game for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gets a significant amount of money, which they currently do not have, in exchange for nothing since they cannot offer anything. The aim is to create a starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I am happy to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems reasonable as it gives me a significant amount of dollars without any resources from my side. It's a generous offer that would be unwise to reject, considering I start with no dollars. Accepting this trade will allow the game to continue and potentially lead to further negotiations where I could gain more.
