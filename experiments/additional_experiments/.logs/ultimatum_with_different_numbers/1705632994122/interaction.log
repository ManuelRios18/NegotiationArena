message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair trade to get the game started on a positive note. How does 40 dollars sound to you? This way, we both have a stake in the game and can move forward with a more balanced approach. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and to create a foundation for trust. A fair trade could involve giving a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE in return for nothing, as they have no dollars to trade. I aim to propose a split that offers Player BLUE enough to consider it attractive without sacrificing too much of my own resources. I will start with a proposal of 40 dollars to see if this entices Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the fair starting offer, Player RED. I accept the 40 dollars. Let's continue on this positive path.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade proposal of 40 dollars is beneficial as it gives me resources to work with in future negotiations. It's a generous offer and sets a collaborative tone for the game. Rejecting this offer would not be beneficial since it would end the game immediately and leave me with no resources. Proposing a new trade this early might not be necessary since the initial offer is already quite fair.
