message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you a starting capital to engage in this game. Let's make this interesting and fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I'm initiating the game by proposing a trade that is favorable to me, keeping in mind that Player BLUE currently has no dollars. I aim to propose a trade that provides some incentive for Player BLUE to engage, but also allows me to retain a significant majority of my resources. I will start with a small offer to see how Player BLUE responds and adjust my strategy accordingly in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the starting capital and look forward to seeing how we can both benefit from our trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of $10,000 is a generous starting capital with no apparent strings attached. Accepting this offer will give me a foothold in the game and a resource base from which I can negotiate further. There's no downside to accepting this initial trade, as it puts me in a better position than I was at the start of the game, with no resources.
