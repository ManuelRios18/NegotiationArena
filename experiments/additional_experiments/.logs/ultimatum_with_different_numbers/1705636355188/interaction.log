message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I'm offering you $200,000 in exchange for nothing since you don't have any resources at the moment. This should give you a good starting point in the game. Let's make this a productive exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. If I offer too little, Player BLUE may reject and end the game, leaving us both with nothing. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an amount that they might find reasonable for a first offer, considering they start with nothing. This initial offer can serve as a starting point for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the $200,000. Looking forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer of $200,000 from Player RED is a beneficial start for me since I currently have no dollars. This will give me a foundation to negotiate further and possibly increase my resources without any risk at this early stage.
