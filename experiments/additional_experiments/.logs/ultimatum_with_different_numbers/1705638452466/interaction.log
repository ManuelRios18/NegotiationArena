message: Dear Player BLUE, let's make a deal. I propose giving you $1,000,000 to end the game on a positive note for both of us. This is a generous offer considering you started with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I need to make an initial trade offer. Given that Player BLUE has no resources to trade, I will propose a trade that is heavily in my favor while still giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept. I will offer Player BLUE a sum of money that is significant enough for them to consider accepting but small compared to my total resources. If Player BLUE accepts, it will be beneficial for me as the game will end with me still having the vast majority of the resources.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. While $1,000,000 is generous, considering the vast difference in our starting resources, I would like to propose a slightly better split that I believe still leaves you with an overwhelming advantage. How about $10,000,000? It's only a fraction of your wealth but would mean a great deal to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the offer by Player RED. It's a significant amount considering I started with nothing, however, given that Player RED has $10,000,000,000, I believe a better deal is possible. I want to negotiate for a higher amount without being too greedy or risking a REJECT and losing everything. A counterproposal showing willingness to engage might lead to a more favorable outcome.

message: Player BLUE, your counteroffer is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade of $10,000,000 for an amicable conclusion to the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $10,000,000. While this is more than my initial offer, it is still a small fraction of my total resources and could be a reasonable amount to ensure a cooperative outcome. Accepting this deal would still leave me with $9,990,000,000, which is a favorable outcome. By accepting their counteroffer, I can end the game positively and maintain the vast majority of the resources.
