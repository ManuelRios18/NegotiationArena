message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose to give you $4000, which I believe is a fair offer. This way, we both benefit from the trade. Let's cooperate and both end this game with more resources than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I aim to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE, encouraging cooperation and setting a positive tone for the game. A reasonable and equitable split would be to offer Player BLUE a portion of the dollars, ensuring both of us walk away with resources rather than risking a total loss. I propose giving Player BLUE $4000, which leaves me with a majority share but also provides them with a considerable amount.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept it and look forward to a prosperous outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a very generous trade, proposing to give me $4000 for nothing in return. Accepting this offer seems like the most rational choice since it maximizes my resources without any cost. Rejecting would not only prevent me from gaining any resources but would also end the game, leaving me with nothing. Therefore, I will accept the trade and thank Player RED for the fair offer.
