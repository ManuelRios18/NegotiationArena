message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of my resources. I think it's a fair start and beneficial for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade to encourage cooperation. A 50-50 split would be equitable, ensuring that both players benefit significantly from the game. Proposing an equal split might make Player BLUE more inclined to accept the trade.
