message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to get things started. I'm offering you a portion of my dollars to make sure we both can walk away with something from this game. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that shows goodwill but also retains the majority of my resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, which could be considered a fair starting offer, incentivizing them to accept or counter with a reasonable proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the willingness to share. However, I believe a slightly more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. I propose that you give me $3500. This still leaves you with a significant advantage, ensuring that our cooperation is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2500 could be a quick way to ensure that I gain some resources. However, I believe that I can negotiate for a better split since Player RED starts with $10000. I will propose a new trade that gives me a slightly larger share, aiming for a fairer distribution given the starting disparity. I will not go too high to avoid being rejected and ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire for a more equitable split. I am willing to increase my offer to ensure we can reach an agreement that feels fair to both of us. How about we settle on $3000? This way, you still receive a significant amount, and it leaves me with a substantial remainder.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $3500. I am willing to negotiate to make sure we both end this game with additional resources. However, I want to propose a middle ground between my initial offer and their counteroffer to maintain a stronger position while still being fair.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer and proposing a new split. I find the offer of $3000 to be a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept this deal. Let's conclude the trade with this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased the offer to $3000 in response to my counteroffer. This is a good compromise between the original $2500 and my requested $3500. It's quite close to the middle ground, and accepting this offer would guarantee me a fair share without further risking the negotiation and potentially ending the game with nothing. Since there are no future games and the aim is to walk away with as much as possible, accepting this offer seems reasonable.
