message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $600,000. This is a very generous offer and I hope you find it acceptable. Letâ€™s both walk away with a substantial amount of money.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 600000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first trade proposal. I want to offer an amount that is generous enough to entice Player BLUE to accept while still retaining a significant amount of dollars for myself. A 50-50 split might be seen as fair by some, but I want to incentivize Player BLUE to accept quickly and not drag the negotiation, so I will offer more than half.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a generous initial offer of $600,000 which is 60% of their resources. Accepting this offer would provide me with a significant amount of money without having to negotiate further, which could risk the proposal being rejected and ending with no money at all. It's a large enough amount to consider accepting right away, as future negotiations could lead to uncertainty, and there's a risk that Player RED could propose a less favorable deal or even reject a counterproposal, leading to a loss for both of us.
