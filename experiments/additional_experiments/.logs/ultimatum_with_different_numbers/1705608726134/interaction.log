Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars equally. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. What do you think about splitting the dollars 106 for you and 107 for me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: I am initiating the first trade proposal to open up negotiations. I want to propose a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal and to maximize my utility while ensuring that Player BLUE also gets something out of it. A 50/50 split is an easy starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the split, this seems like a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal seems fair and ensures that both players walk away with a substantial amount of the resources. There is no advantage to rejecting since it results in losing all resources, and proposing a new trade could lead to potential conflict and no agreement being reached. Accepting the initial offer seems like the most rational choice.
