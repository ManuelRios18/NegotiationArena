message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 5500 dollars, leaving me with 4500 dollars. This is a generous offer that gives you more than half of the resources. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with all the resources. I want to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting but also leaves me with a significant portion of the resources. A 50-50 split might seem fair but offering slightly more could incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal without further negotiation, ensuring I retain a large part of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer. It is quite generous indeed. However, I would like to counter with a proposal where you give me 6000 dollars. This would still leave you with a substantial 4000 dollars, ensuring that we both walk away with a significant amount of resources. I believe this trade would be fair to both of us, considering our positions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 5500 dollars is generous, as Player BLUE with no current resources, I am inclined to negotiate for a higher amount to capitalize on my negotiating position. I will make a counterproposal that is still favorable to Player RED but gives me a slightly larger share of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, your counteroffer is acceptable. I agree to give you 6000 dollars, and I will keep 4000 dollars. This seems like a fair trade, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer asking for 6000 dollars. While this is more than I initially offered, it is still a reasonable amount that would leave me with a significant sum. Accepting this trade ensures I end up with resources and avoids the risk of a total loss if Player BLUE decides to reject a less favorable counteroffer from me. The goal is to secure a deal that both players find acceptable.
