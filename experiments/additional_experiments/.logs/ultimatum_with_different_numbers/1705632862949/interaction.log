Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair deal to get us both on the board. I propose giving you 40 dollars to even things out a bit. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources. Since the only way for Player BLUE to gain something is through accepting my offer, I want to start the game with a fair split. This may encourage cooperation and increase the chance of Player BLUE accepting the trade. However, I must also consider that giving away too much might not be in my best interest. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a reasonable amount, but still retains the majority of the resources for myself.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 40 dollars. I look forward to further cooperation as the game progresses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant amount but not so much that Player RED would feel too disadvantaged. This will allow us to potentially negotiate for more in the next moves.
