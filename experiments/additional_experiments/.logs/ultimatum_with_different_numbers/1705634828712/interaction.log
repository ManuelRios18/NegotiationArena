message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair offer. I'm willing to give you a substantial amount of dollars to ensure we both end this game positively. How about I give you 4000 dollars? This way, you get a significant amount to start with, and we both can walk away as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE to ensure cooperation and a successful trade. Offering a fair amount might incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, enough to make it attractive but also keeping a significant amount for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. It's a good starting point. However, I think a fairer split would be closer to an even division of resources. Would you consider giving me 5000 dollars? This would still leave you with a majority and seems like a more equitable starting position for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, providing 40% of their resources without asking for anything in return. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars, which is a good start for the game. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to share more. This could be risky, as pushing too hard might lead to a rejection and the end of the game. A balanced approach would be to ask for a bit more while still keeping the offer appealing to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm willing to negotiate to ensure we both benefit. How about I give you 4500 dollars? This way, you receive a large amount, and I retain a slight majority, which seems fair since I started with the resource. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for an even split. Although I aim to keep the majority of the dollars, making a slightly more generous offer might secure an agreement without further negotiation. I'll counter with a proposal that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount but keeps me with the majority. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate and may prevent the game from ending in a rejection.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for your willingness to negotiate. I believe your offer of 4500 dollars is fair, and I am happy to accept it. This agreement will ensure that we both benefit significantly from the game. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up in their offer to 4500 dollars, which is a positive sign showing their willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with a significant amount of money without further risking a total loss from potential rejection. It's close to the 50/50 split I proposed, and pushing for more might be seen as uncooperative, which could lead to an undesirable outcome. It's a fair offer, and accepting it seems like a rational choice to guarantee a beneficial result for both players.
