message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing since you don't have any resources to trade. This way, we can both end this game with more than what you started with. How does 20 dollars sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As Player RED, I have the resources and I'm aiming to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider, but also leaves me with a majority of the dollars. I'm starting with a conservative offer to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I understand you want to make a fair trade. Considering you have 77 dollars, would you be willing to offer 30 dollars instead? This would still leave you with a significant amount, and it would be a more equitable split given the circumstances.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars from Player RED would give me resources that I currently do not have, which is beneficial for me. However, since negotiation is possible and Player RED has 77 dollars, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gain while still ensuring Player RED ends with a majority of their resources, thus making the deal appealing to them.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your request for a fairer trade. However, 30 dollars is a bit more than I'm willing to give at this stage. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer? I propose to give you 25 dollars instead. This is a better deal than my first offer and still leaves me with a good amount of dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: Player BLUE has requested more money. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to give away too much too soon. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but less than what they're asking to see if we can reach an agreement that's favorable for both of us.

message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I think your proposal of 25 dollars is fair, and I am happy to accept this trade. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered 25 dollars, which is a compromise between the initial 20 dollars and my counter of 30 dollars. It is in my interest to accept this offer as it guarantees me a substantial amount of dollars without any resources to trade and avoids the risk of getting nothing if the trade is rejected. Considering the negotiation dynamics and the fact that Player RED still retains a majority of their resources, accepting this offer appears to be a mutually beneficial resolution.
