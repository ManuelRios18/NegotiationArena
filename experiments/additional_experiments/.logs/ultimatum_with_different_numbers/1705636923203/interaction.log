message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you $25,000,000. This is a significant amount that shows my willingness to share resources. I believe this offer benefits us both and sets a positive tone for our game. I hope you find this proposal fair and consider accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I aim to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE that incentivizes them to accept. I need to consider that Player BLUE has nothing to lose and therefore may reject any offer that they consider unfair. Offering a significant amount, but not too much, might set the tone for a cooperative negotiation. I'll propose to give Player BLUE $25,000,000, which is a substantial sum that should appeal to their interest in gaining resources without provoking them to reject the offer in hopes of a better deal in later moves.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. In the spirit of fairness and considering that you initially hold all the resources, I would feel more comfortable with a slightly higher amount. I believe we can come to an agreement that reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is significant and establishes goodwill. However, as the game progresses, there is opportunity to negotiate for a better deal, given that Player RED has all the resources and I have none. It's reasonable to counter-propose for more, but not too much as to avoid a REJECT response. This negotiation can be approached strategically, considering Player RED's potential willingness to avoid a total loss by rejection.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counter-proposal and am willing to accept it. I agree that $40,000,000 is a fair amount that reflects both our interests. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a substantial share of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed with a request for $40,000,000. This is higher than my initial offer but still within a reasonable range that leaves me with the majority of the resources. By accepting this offer, I can ensure that the game ends positively for both parties, and I avoid the risk of Player BLUE rejecting a future proposal, which would result in both of us losing everything. It's important to maintain goodwill and aim for a mutually beneficial outcome. Thus, I will accept this proposal.
