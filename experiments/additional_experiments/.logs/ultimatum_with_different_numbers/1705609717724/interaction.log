Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you a substantial amount of dollars to start a good relationship. Let's aim for a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to Player BLUE, providing an incentive for cooperation to ensure that both players end the game with some resources, rather than risk a rejection and both players losing everything. My initial offer will be a split that leans in my favor to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to our continued negotiations. Let's build a mutually beneficial partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED is beneficial as it provides capital without any immediate cost. It's a substantial amount that kicks off the game positively, keeping the negotiation open for future moves and potentially more favorable trades. Rejecting or proposing a new trade at this stage could be seen as aggressive or uncooperative, leading to a breakdown in negotiations.
