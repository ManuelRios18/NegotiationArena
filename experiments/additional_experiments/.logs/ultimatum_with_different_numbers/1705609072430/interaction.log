Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose an initial trade where I give you a portion of my dollars. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. What do you say we start with a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources at the beginning. I want to propose a trade that seems fair in order to incentivize Player BLUE to accept and continue the game. My goal is to end with more resources than I give away while ensuring Player BLUE feels they are getting a good deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. It's a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a 50/50 split is a fair starting point that ensures both players come out of this game with a significant amount of dollars, creating a win-win situation. There's a risk that by countering, the other player might reduce their offer, and since Player RED has the final move, they could potentially leave me with less or nothing if the game progresses unfavorably. Accepting now secures a good outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4
