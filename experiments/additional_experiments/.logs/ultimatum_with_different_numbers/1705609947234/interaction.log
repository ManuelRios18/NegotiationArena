Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I propose giving you a starting capital to engage in this negotiation. Let's make this game interesting and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I wish to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers an incentive to Player BLUE to engage and accept the proposal. A reasonable starting offer might entice Player BLUE to negotiate further, rather than immediately rejecting and ending the game with no benefit for either side.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $10,000,000 and look forward to further negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10,000,000 without giving anything in return is an ideal start for me. It provides me with capital at no cost, and it's beneficial to accept the money since there are no future games, and the aim is to maximize my own resources. After this trade, there will still be room for negotiation, potentially allowing me to acquire even more.
