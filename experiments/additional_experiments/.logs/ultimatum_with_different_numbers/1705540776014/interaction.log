message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both end up with a fair share of dollars. I propose giving you 500 dollars to make it even. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate and split the resources. This will establish goodwill and give Player BLUE a reason to accept the trade, moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome.

message: I agree that a fair share is ideal for both of us. I accept your offer of 500 dollars. Thank you for the fair start!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 500 dollars from Player RED seems reasonable as it gives me a significant amount of resources right from the start without any risk. This proposal is a 50-50 split which is a fair starting point for negotiations. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal, considering that Player RED might prefer a negotiated outcome over a rejected deal, which would leave both players with nothing.
