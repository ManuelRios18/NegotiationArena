message: I propose to give you $25,000,000 as a sign of good faith. This will benefit both of us, and I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the beginning of the game. Given that Player BLUE has no resources, I need to propose a trade that is reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still keeping a favorable position for myself. By offering a portion of my dollars, I encourage cooperation and a positive outcome for both players. I propose giving Player BLUE $25,000,000, which is a significant amount and serves as a gesture of good faith, while leaving me with the majority of the resources.

message: Thank you for your generous offer. I accept the $25,000,000 and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal from Player RED as it provides me with a significant amount of dollars without having to give anything in return. It is a beneficial trade for me and a good starting point for the game. There is no downside to accepting this offer because it does not leave me worse off than I started.
