Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where we both end up with a substantial amount of dollars. I'm thinking of a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 16 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game by proposing a split that is somewhat favorable to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE might consider accepting. By offering Player BLUE a significant portion of the dollars, I aim to show goodwill and create a cooperative dynamic. Proposing an equal split might be the safest option to ensure acceptance, but I will propose a slightly skewed distribution in my favor to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, but I would like to propose a slightly more balanced trade that would benefit us both. How about a 55/45 split in your favor? This way, we can both feel like we're getting a substantial amount and can walk away from this game satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While a 60/40 split is not equal, it is a fair starting point for negotiation considering I started with no dollars. Accepting this initial offer would provide me with some resources to work with, and from there I could attempt to negotiate a more favorable split for myself in subsequent moves. Rejecting or countering with an overly aggressive offer may lead to an early end to the game with no gain for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your proposal for a 55/45 split. It seems fair and beneficial to both of us. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a more balanced trade, which is reasonable. Accepting a 55/45 split does not deviate much from my initial proposal and shows I am willing to compromise. This should help maintain a positive dynamic and bring us closer to a deal that is acceptable for both parties.
MOVE: 2 / 4
