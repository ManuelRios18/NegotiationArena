Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits both of us. I propose giving you some free dollars to get things started. How does that sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the bargaining power since Player BLUE has no resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, as an outright unfair trade might cause Player BLUE to reject it, ending the game with no benefit for either of us. I will offer a small amount of my dollars for nothing in return to start the negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I'm looking forward to a fair and mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is beneficial as it provides me with free resources without any cost. It's a positive starting point for negotiation and sets a precedent for cooperation. Accepting this offer is strategically advantageous as it allows the game to continue and potentially leads to more favorable trades in the future.
