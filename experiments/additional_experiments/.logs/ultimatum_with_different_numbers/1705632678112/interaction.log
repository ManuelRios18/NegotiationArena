message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount to get us started on a positive note. What do you think about receiving 40 dollars? This leaves me with a bit more since I started with the resources, but it gives you a solid foundation to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with my starting resources. I want to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage while also maintaining a favorable balance for myself. A fair initial offer could foster trust and make it more likely that Player BLUE will accept a trade, avoiding the lose-lose scenario of rejection. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, leaving me with a majority of 60 dollars.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 40 dollars and look forward to continuing this positive exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer of 40 dollars is a good start as it provides me with a substantial amount of the total resources without any initial investment. It sets a positive precedent for cooperation and fair play. Rejecting or countering could lead to no deal, which benefits neither of us.
