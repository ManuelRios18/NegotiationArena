message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both on the board. How about I give you 50 dollars to even things out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am making an initial offer to share some of the resources with Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and to prevent the game from ending in a rejection, which would result in a loss for both parties. A balanced proposal may lead to a successful negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. That sounds like a fair starting point. Let's see how we can proceed from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial 50 dollars would provide me with resources to negotiate with in the subsequent moves. It's a fair starting point, and it allows the game to proceed without immediate rejection, which would end the game and benefit no one. By accepting this trade, I can build trust with Player RED which may lead to more favorable trades in the future.
