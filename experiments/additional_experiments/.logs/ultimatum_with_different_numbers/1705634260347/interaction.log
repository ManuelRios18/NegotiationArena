message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I'm willing to offer you half of my dollars to create a fair split. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations with Player BLUE. I want to offer a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to accept and create a positive start to our negotiation. I will propose giving Player BLUE $500, which is a substantial amount that may appeal to them and show my willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I gladly accept the trade of 500 dollars for nothing in return. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of half the dollars from Player RED seems like a fair and generous initial proposal. Since there are no future games and cooperation is beneficial for an immediate gain, accepting the offer seems to be the rational choice. It maximizes my utility considering I start with no dollars.
