------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade. How about I give you $300 to get you started? This leaves me with a majority but gives you a significant amount to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial split of resources that offers some benefit to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal, while still keeping a majority for myself. This first proposal is conservative to leave room for negotiation in the subsequent turns.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the $300. It's a fair starting point for us to continue the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $300 from RED would immediately put me in a better position without any risk. I have nothing to lose at this point and everything to gain by accepting this offer. It's a generous first move on RED's part, and it sets a positive tone for the game. Rejecting or countering could lead to a negative outcome, including RED potentially withdrawing the offer or the game ending with a REJECT from either side.
MOVE: 1/4
