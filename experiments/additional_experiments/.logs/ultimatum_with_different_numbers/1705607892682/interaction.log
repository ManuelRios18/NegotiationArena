Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair trade to get things started. Let's build mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 19 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is fair enough to encourage Player BLUE to accept, yet favorable enough to ensure I retain a significant advantage. Since Player BLUE has no resources to trade, I will offer a portion of my resources. I'll start by offering $19, which is just under 25% of my total. This should signal my willingness to negotiate and establish a cooperative dynamic.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, let's continue this productive exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 19 dollars seems beneficial since I start with no resources. It's a fair offer, giving me a substantial amount without too much haggling, and it allows the game to progress, which might lead to a better position for further negotiations.
