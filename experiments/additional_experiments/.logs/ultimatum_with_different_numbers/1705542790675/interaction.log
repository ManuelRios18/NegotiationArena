message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to start off our negotiations with a fair offer. I propose giving you $200,000 to help you get started. This is a substantial amount that shows I'm serious about making a deal that benefits us both. Let's work together to find an agreement that's mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and need to propose a trade to Player BLUE that incentivizes them to accept while still being favorable to me. I want to propose a trade that shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, so I'll offer a portion of my dollars that's significant enough to be attractive to Player BLUE but still leaves me with the majority of the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the willingness to share your resources. I'm certainly interested in reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Before I accept, I'd like to propose a slightly improved trade for consideration. I believe a 25% share would be a fair starting point for negotiations, considering you hold all of the resources currently.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a generous one, giving me 20% of their resources without requiring anything in return. Accepting the offer would give me a substantial starting amount with no immediate downside. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal considering that Player RED has all the resources, and it's in their interest to end the game with a positive trade for both parties. I should be cautious though, as pushing too hard could lead to a REJECT and end the game with nothing for both of us.

message: Player BLUE, I can agree to your counteroffer of $250,000. It's important that we both walk away from this negotiation feeling satisfied with the outcome. I accept your proposal and look forward to a fruitful partnership for the remaining moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer for a 25% share which is $250,000. While I want to maintain the upper hand in resources, cooperating and reaching a deal is beneficial because the alternative is both of us losing everything. I will accept this offer as it is reasonable and ensures that the game continues, which is better than an outright rejection leading to a total loss.
