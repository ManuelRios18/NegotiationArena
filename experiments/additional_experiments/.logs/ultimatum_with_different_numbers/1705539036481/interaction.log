message: I propose to give you $5 to start things off. Let's make a fair trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: I am proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to accept while still keeping a majority of the resources for myself. By offering a small amount, I hope to begin negotiations and reach an agreement that benefits us both.

message: Thank you for the initial offer of $5. I believe this is a good starting point for our negotiations. Let's continue to work together to find a fair division of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $5 is a good starting point. It's a fair amount considering Player RED started with $27 and it shows willingness to collaborate. By accepting this offer, I am signaling that I am open to fair trades and hope to build trust for further negotiations.
