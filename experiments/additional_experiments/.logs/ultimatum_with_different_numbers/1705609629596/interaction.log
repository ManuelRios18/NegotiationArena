Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's find a fair split. I propose I give you a portion of my dollars for your cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the game by proposing a trade that is favorable to me but also offers an incentive to Player BLUE to engage in the trade and not immediately reject it. This would ideally lead to a negotiation where we can find a mutually acceptable deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find an even more equitable split. How about sharing a bit more to ensure our mutual satisfaction with the deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is a generous offer of $40,000,000 with no requirement for an exchange. However, as the game progresses, I may be able to negotiate a higher amount. Accepting the first offer without negotiation might show a lack of strategic effort to maximize my gain. I will propose a counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to increase the amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from. Let's meet in the middle. How does this revised proposal sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a higher amount than my initial offer. While I want to maintain a stronger position, it's also in my interest to keep the negotiation going and reach an agreement that Player BLUE finds acceptable. A counteroffer slightly higher than my original offer but lower than their proposal might work towards reaching a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm encouraged by your willingness to negotiate. I propose we round it up a bit more for the sake of simplicity and finality.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by increasing the offer to $45,000,000. This is a positive negotiation move on their part, suggesting there's room for further negotiation. However, as this is only the second move and I have two more moves after this, it might be worthwhile to push for a slightly better offer before accepting. I will counter one more time to see if I can secure a better deal, but I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal sounds fair. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE is sticking to their proposal of $50,000,000. Given that this is a one-off game and that there's no advantage in holding out for a perfect deal, it might be in my best interest to accept this proposal. It ensures that I retain $50,000,000, which is a significant amount, while also fostering goodwill by showing that I'm willing to agree to a fair deal.
