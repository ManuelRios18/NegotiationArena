This is a positive negotiation move on their part, suggesting there's room for further negotiation. However, as this is only the second move and I have two more moves after this, it might be worthwhile to push for a slightly better offer before accepting. I will counter one more time to see if I can secure a better deal, but I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk rejection. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I'm encouraged by your willingness to negotiate. I propose we round it up a bit more for the sake of simplicity and finality. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
