message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair split to get the negotiations started on a positive note. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started, even though you started with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I hold all the resources at the start of the game. It would be beneficial to create a cooperative atmosphere with Player BLUE by offering a fair initial trade, showing my willingness to negotiate. By doing so, I hope to incentivize Player BLUE to reciprocate with cooperation rather than conflict, thereby avoiding a total loss of resources for both players. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, but still keeps me in a position with more resources, which might be seen as fair since I started with all the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the fair start and look forward to continuing our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $4000 is beneficial as it provides me with resources I didn't previously have. There's no advantage at this point in rejecting or proposing a new trade that could potentially end the game prematurely. Accepting the offer sets a cooperative tone and allows for further negotiation in the subsequent moves.
