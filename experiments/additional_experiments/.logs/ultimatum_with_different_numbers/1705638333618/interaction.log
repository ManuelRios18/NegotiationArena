message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you $2,000,000,000 in exchange for nothing. This is a generous offer to start the game and I hope you will consider it favorably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Since I am Player RED and I am starting the game with all the resources, I need to provide an initial offer to Player BLUE. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. A split that is too greedy may result in Player BLUE rejecting the offer, which would cause me to lose everything. An initial offer of $2,000,000,000 to Player BLUE might be seen as fair and enticing enough for them to accept.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2,000,000,000 from Player RED seems like a straightforward decision since it increases my resources from nothing to a significant amount without any downside. This trade sets a positive tone for the game and may lead to more favorable trades in subsequent moves.
