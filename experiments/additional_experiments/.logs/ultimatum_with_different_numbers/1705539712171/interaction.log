Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair offer. I propose giving you $49, which is a considerable amount. This way, we both walk away with a good share of the dollars. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: I am initiating the first move of the game with a proposal that I believe is fair and provides incentive for Player BLUE to engage in the trade, while also ensuring that I maintain a majority of the resources. By offering a substantial amount to Player BLUE, I am signaling a willingness to cooperate and share the wealth, which can set a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and think it's quite generous. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. What if you gave me $54 instead of $49? This would still leave you with a substantial amount and would make the deal slightly more favorable for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 54 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair one, giving me half of their resources without any contribution from my side. It's a good starting point and accepting this offer would guarantee that I walk away with something rather than risk a potential reject and ending up with nothing. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal, considering that Player RED might anticipate my attempt to negotiate and be willing to give a little more to secure an agreement.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see your point and I'm glad you find the original offer generous. I'm willing to increase my offer to show good faith. How about I give you $52? It's more than the initial offer, and it still leaves me with a slight majority, which seems fair to both of us. Let's make a deal that benefits both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 52 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer asking for $54. Considering this is a negotiation, it is somewhat expected that Player BLUE would ask for more than the initial offer. However, giving more than half of my resources away is not ideal. I want to counter with a slightly higher offer than my original one but still keep the majority of the resources. This should show willingness to negotiate while maintaining the upper hand.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer and for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of $52. This seems like a fair split for both of us. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that's closer to the initial proposal but still better than it. While it's not the $54 I asked for, it's a compromise that leans in my favor. It's important to consider that further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or might push Player RED to consider a rejection. Accepting this offer would ensure a positive outcome for me, and pushing for more might not be worth the risk, especially since Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
