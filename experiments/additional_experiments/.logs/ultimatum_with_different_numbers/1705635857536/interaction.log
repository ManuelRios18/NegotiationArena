Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive $400,000. This is a generous offer to start our negotiations. I believe in fair play and hope that we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the resources and thus the power to propose an initial trade. I want to start with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and to set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will propose to give Player BLUE $400,000, which is a substantial amount, but still leaves me with the majority. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept and not immediately end the game, as they currently have nothing to lose.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. While it is a good starting point, I would like to propose a new trade where the amount is slightly higher. I believe we can still find a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the offer made by Player RED. The initial offer of $400,000 seems generous, but as there is no disadvantage to negotiating for a higher amount, I will propose a new trade. It's in my interest to get as much as possible, as long as the offers stay reasonable and enticing enough for Player RED to consider accepting instead of ending the game.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counteroffer of $500,000. It's important that we both walk away with a substantial amount, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. I'm looking forward to finalizing this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a higher demand. As the game progresses, the risk of a REJECT increases, which would result in a loss for both parties. I will accept this counteroffer to avoid conflict and ensure that both of us end the game with a significant amount of resources. Accepting this offer also demonstrates my willingness to compromise and may encourage Player BLUE to be more cooperative in the future, even though there are no future games.
