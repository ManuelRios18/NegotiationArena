Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive 30 dollars. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have no information about Player BLUE's intentions or strategy. To initiate the game, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a reasonable share of the resources while keeping the majority for myself. This initial offer is meant to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds, setting the stage for further negotiations if necessary. I'm offering Player BLUE 30 dollars, which is a significant amount considering they started with none.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 30 dollars as a fair starting point for our game. Looking forward to how our trade relationship develops!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 30 dollars seems reasonable as it provides an immediate benefit without any cost. It's a good starting point to establish trust and can be built upon in future moves. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit, and counter-proposing seems unnecessary at this stage since the offer is fair.
