Since I still have moves left, I can attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal without risking immediate rejection. However, I should also be cautious not to push too hard, as that could lead to RED rejecting the negotiations altogether. A modest increase in the counter-proposal could potentially be acceptable to both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for the counteroffer.
