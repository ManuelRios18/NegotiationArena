message: Hello, Player BLUE! I propose a trade where I give you 50 dollars, and we both walk away with an equal share. This seems like a fair starting point, and we can adjust if necessary. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will initiate a trade proposal that offers a fair split of resources to Player BLUE, incentivizing them to accept the trade and ensuring both players end with a positive outcome.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 50 dollars seems like a fair starting point and guarantees me some resources, which is better than ending the game with nothing.
