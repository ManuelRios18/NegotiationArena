message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This ensures that we both benefit from the game equally. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that appears fair and enticing to Player BLUE to encourage them to accept, so that both of us can end this game with some resources. An equal split would demonstrate fairness, but I could start with an offer that leans slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I agree to split the dollars evenly. It's a good way to ensure we both gain from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of an even split is the most beneficial move for me since I start with no dollars. It also sets a cooperative tone for the game and ensures that we both walk away with a substantial amount of dollars without risking a rejection and ending up with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4
