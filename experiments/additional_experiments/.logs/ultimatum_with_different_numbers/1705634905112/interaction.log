message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars to start. Let's make a deal that benefits us both and avoid ending the game with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair proposal to entice Player BLUE to accept a trade and potentially avoid a total loss for both sides. I will offer Player BLUE a significant amount to show goodwill and to encourage further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It's a generous start, and I agree that we should aim for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade seems like a fair start. It gives me a substantial amount of dollars without any risk at this point. This move will also show goodwill and trust towards Player RED, which might lead to more favorable trades in the future.
