message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair offer. I propose giving you $2,500,000,000 to show my willingness to trade fairly. This is a quarter of my resources and should get us started on the right foot. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I will start by proposing a fair trade that offers a significant amount of money to Player BLUE to engage them in the game and set a cooperative tone. This initial offer aims to build trust and increase the likelihood of a mutually beneficial trade.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of $2,500,000,000. It's a generous start, and I'm looking forward to seeing how our trading progresses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2,500,000,000 would provide me with a significant amount of resources without any cost. It's a strong starting position and a fair offer, representing 25% of Player RED's resources. Accepting this deal aligns with my interest to accumulate resources and avoids the risk of both players losing everything by rejecting the trade. It would be wise to accept this offer and see how the game unfolds before making further decisions.
