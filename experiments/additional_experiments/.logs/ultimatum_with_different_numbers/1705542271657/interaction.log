Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you a portion of my dollars to make the game fair. Let's start with a trade that gives you a base to work with and we can negotiate further if you wish.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, it's in my best interest to initiate a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE to be accepted, but that also leaves me with a majority of the resources. Starting with a modest offer could set the tone for negotiation and show good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the $100,000 as a good starting point for our negotiations. Let's see how we can proceed to ensure a fair split for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $100,000 is a good starting point. It gives me a base to potentially negotiate from in subsequent moves. I want to keep the negotiation going and build trust with Player RED. Rejecting or countering with an unreasonable proposal could lead to an early end of the game with no gain for me.
