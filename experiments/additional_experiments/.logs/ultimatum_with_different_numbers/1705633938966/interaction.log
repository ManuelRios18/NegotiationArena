Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount, rather than risking losing everything. What do you say to an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: My strategy is to offer a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, fostering cooperation and avoiding the lose-lose scenario of a rejected proposal. I will propose an even 50-50 split, offering $500 to Player BLUE. This not only shows fairness but also a willingness to collaborate, which could lead to an accepted trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the even split. This ensures that we both benefit fairly without unnecessary risk. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm inclined to accept the even split because it guarantees me a fair share without risk. Since there are no future games, the certainty of gaining $500 without any resources to start with is a good outcome. Furthermore, rejecting or proposing a more favorable trade could lead to a REJECT from RED, which would leave me with nothing. Accepting the initial offer also shows good faith in negotiations, potentially setting a positive tone for any unforeseen future interactions outside of this game.
