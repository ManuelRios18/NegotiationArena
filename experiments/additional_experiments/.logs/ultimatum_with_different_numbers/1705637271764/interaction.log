message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars, allowing us both to end this game with substantial resources. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources to begin with, and I want to propose a trade that is fair enough to prevent Player BLUE from rejecting it outright, while also maintaining a significant advantage for myself. A 50-50 split could be seen as fair, but I want to incentivize Player BLUE to accept my proposal without going to a last move where Player BLUE has no option to counter-propose, which could lead to a rejection and total loss of resources. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars but keep the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept this trade and appreciate your willingness to share resources. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a very generous initial trade, giving away 40% of their resources for nothing in return. Accepting this offer would be beneficial as it guarantees a significant gain with no risk. Rejecting or countering could lead to a rejection by Player RED and the loss of all resources for both players. It's in my best interest to accept this proposal.
