Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both and avoids a total loss. I propose giving you a substantial starting amount to level the playing field.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: I am proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game rather than ending it with no resources for either of us. I want to offer enough to make it appealing, but not so much that I lose the advantage. Splitting the resources evenly right away might not be strategic, as it doesn't give me leverage in future moves. I'll propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant amount, but still keeps me in a stronger position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. It's a great start to ensure we both can walk away with something substantial.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer would give me a significant amount of dollars which is infinitely better than having none. It's a good starting point to engage in the game, and rejecting or countering with an unreasonable demand might lead to an immediate end of the game with no benefit for either player.
