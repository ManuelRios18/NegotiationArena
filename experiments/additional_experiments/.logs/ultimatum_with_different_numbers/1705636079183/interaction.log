message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both can end this game positively. I propose a trade that gives you some initial funds to work with. Let's start the negotiations and find a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: I am proposing a trade to engage with Player BLUE and encourage a cooperative game where we can both end with positive resources. I am offering a small amount of my resources to see if Player BLUE is receptive to cooperation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting offer, Player RED. I'm looking forward to building on this positive momentum.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal provides a positive starting point for negotiation. It is in my interest to gain some capital to work with, and rejecting the proposal without a counteroffer could lead to an undesirable outcome where both players end up with nothing. By accepting, I show goodwill and a willingness to negotiate, which could lead to more favorable proposals in the future.
