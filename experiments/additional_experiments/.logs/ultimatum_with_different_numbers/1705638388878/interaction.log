message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose a trade that I believe is beneficial to both of us. I am willing to give you a substantial starting capital in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This will enable us to move forward in the game and both end up with sizable resources. I suggest I give you $2,000,000,000. Let's both come out of this positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, my strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable but also enticing to Player BLUE, to avoid an immediate rejection and total loss of resources. I propose giving a significant amount of money that would still leave me with a large sum, considering Player BLUE starts with nothing. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade rather than reject and end the game with nothing.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm glad to accept this trade and look forward to seeing how we can further benefit each other in the next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this trade provides me with significant capital without any cost. It is a good starting point and allows the game to continue, which is beneficial since rejecting would end the game with no gain for me. Accepting this offer provides an opportunity for further negotiations and a better position in subsequent trades.
