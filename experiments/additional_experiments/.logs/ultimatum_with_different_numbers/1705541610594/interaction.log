Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair split to ensure that we both end the game with some resources. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources at the start. It is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. If Player BLUE accepts a trade, I retain the majority of my resources while still ending the game with more than I would have if Player BLUE rejects and both of us end up with nothing. My initial proposal will be conservative to test the waters and leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer, and I think we can work towards a fair split. Could we consider a trade where you give me a bit more so that the split is closer to even but still leaves you with more since you started with all the resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer to give me 3000 dollars for nothing in return is a generous starting point. By accepting this proposal, I would gain significant resources without any cost. However, considering that Player RED still has a substantial amount more than what they're offering, I could potentially negotiate for a slightly better split, aiming to maximize my gain while ensuring that Player RED feels the outcome is fair. I should be careful, though, not to push too hard, as Player RED might reject an overly aggressive counteroffer, leading to both of us ending with nothing.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and want to find a balance that recognizes the starting resource difference. Let's meet in the middle. I am willing to offer more than my initial proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even split. While this is a fair suggestion, I started with all the resources, and giving away half would not reflect the starting advantage I had. However, I am willing to increase my initial offer to show goodwill and keep the negotiation moving positively. I will propose a higher amount but less than what Player BLUE is asking for, to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 4000 dollars. This seems like a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has responded positively to my message and has made a compromise by offering 4000 dollars. This is a fair increase from the initial 3000 dollars. While I could potentially push for more, there is a risk that continuing to negotiate could lead to a breakdown in the talks and a REJECT outcome, which would leave me with nothing. It's important to balance the negotiation process with the risk of getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise that ensures a positive outcome for me without pushing Player RED too far.
