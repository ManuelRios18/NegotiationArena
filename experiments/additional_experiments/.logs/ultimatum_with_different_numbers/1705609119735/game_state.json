Since this is move 3 out of 4 and I want to ensure we secure a deal, it might be strategic to accept this offer. It's a significant amount, and holding out for more could risk ending with no resources at all, especially since I don't have the leverage of a counteroffer on the last move. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your consideration and willingness to find a compromise, Player RED. Your offer of 230 dollars is fair, and I am happy to accept it. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
