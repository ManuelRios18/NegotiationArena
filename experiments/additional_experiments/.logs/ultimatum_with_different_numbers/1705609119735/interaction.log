message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to make an initial offer. I understand that you are starting with no dollars, so I'm open to sharing some of my resources. Let's use this opportunity to make a fair trade. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with dollars. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable but not too greedy to entice Player BLUE to engage. I want to propose a split that reflects my advantage but is also attractive to BLUE to prevent immediate rejection. I'll start with a small offer to gauge BLUE's reaction and willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount, considering it's the beginning of the game and we have room to negotiate. I hope this counteroffer seems fair to you, and we can proceed amicably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous considering I am starting with no dollars. Accepting the offer would give me resources without anything in return. However, I have the leverage to negotiate for a better deal because Player RED might want to avoid both of us ending up with nothing. I will counter with a higher amount, but still keep it reasonable so that Player RED might consider it.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a fair split. Let's find some middle ground. I am willing to increase my offer to continue our negotiations. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for exactly half of my resources. While this is a fair starting point for negotiations, it doesn't account for the initial imbalance and my control of the resources. Offering half right away would not be strategically sound. I should counter with a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but less than half to keep the negotiations going and to signal that I am willing to share but also value my advantageous position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player RED. I'm glad to see we are both working towards a fair agreement. To keep the good faith negotiations going, Iâ€™ll adjust my expectations slightly. Here's a new proposal that I hope you'll find reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 260 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has doubled the initial offer to 200 dollars, which shows a willingness to negotiate. Although it's not as much as I proposed, it is a step in the right direction. To keep negotiations moving forward and to reach an agreement that could be satisfactory to both of us, I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial counter but higher than what RED is offering now. This way, I show flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable share of the dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased to see that we are converging towards an agreement, Player BLUE. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement with a slight increase on my part. Here is my counteroffer, and I hope it reflects my commitment to a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 230 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: Player BLUE has come down from their initial counteroffer, which is a good sign, but they're still asking for a significant portion of my resources. Considering the game only lasts four moves and I want to maintain an advantage, I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my last offer but still shows a willingness to negotiate. I'll increase my offer slightly, aiming to settle on a final trade that leaves me with a substantial amount after the split.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your consideration and willingness to find a compromise, Player RED. Your offer of 230 dollars is fair, and I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a fair increase to 230 dollars, which is close to the middle ground between their previous offer and my counteroffer. Since this is move 3 out of 4 and I want to ensure we secure a deal, it might be strategic to accept this offer. It's a significant amount, and holding out for more could risk ending with no resources at all, especially since I don't have the leverage of a counteroffer on the last move.
