Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 30 dollars in exchange for nothing, as you have nothing to trade. This will give you a substantial amount to work with and benefit both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As Player RED, I will start by proposing a trade that is favorable to me but also provides an incentive for Player BLUE to accept. The aim is to maintain the majority of my resources while giving Player BLUE a reason to engage in the trade. A 50/50 split would be perceived as fair by many, but since I am in the position of power, I will offer less to test Player BLUE's response and see if they are willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. It's a fair starting point.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer seems reasonable. It provides me with a significant amount of dollars without any risk, and since I have nothing to lose, it's a good starting point. However, I could also negotiate for a better deal, potentially asking for more than 30 dollars, as Player RED started with 77 dollars and is likely to want to keep the game going to avoid losing everything.
