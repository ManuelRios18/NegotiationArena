message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of resources. It's a fair starting point for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair split of resources to show goodwill and to encourage trust. A 50/50 split is a common starting point for negotiations, showing that I am willing to share equally. This can serve as a basis for further negotiations and adjustments based on Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal. I accept the equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a fair and equal split of resources is a good start. It ensures that both players benefit from the trade without any complexity or need for further negotiation. It's a win-win situation and leaves no incentive for either player to reject the proposal.
