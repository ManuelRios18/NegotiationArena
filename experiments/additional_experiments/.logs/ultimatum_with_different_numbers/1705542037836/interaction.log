message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a fair amount of dollars, ensuring that we both come out of this game with a significant amount of resources. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have the power to initiate a trade. I want to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me, but also offers enough value to Player BLUE to consider accepting it. I must be careful not to offer too little, as this could lead to a rejection and the end of the game. Additionally, offering too much could be a missed opportunity to maintain a larger share of the resources. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount that they didn't have before, incentivizing them to accept the deal.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the willingness to share your resources. However, I believe that a slightly more balanced trade would be more equitable. Would you consider increasing your offer to 5000 dollars? This would still leave you with more than half of your initial resources while providing me with a significant amount to ensure that we both benefit fairly from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED is generous, giving me 30% of their starting resources without requiring anything in return. It's a good starting point, but it's common in negotiations to counter-offer for a better deal, especially since they have much more to lose by a REJECT than I do. A counter-offer that is still reasonable could be beneficial, showing willingness to negotiate but also not immediately settling for the first offer.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your point of view and am willing to work towards an equitable deal. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a trade that is slightly less than what you've asked but still offers you a considerable amount of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has requested a more even split, asking for 5000 dollars. While this is more than I initially offered, it's important to note that Player BLUE started with no resources. By accepting this counteroffer, I would still retain a majority of my initial resources with 5001 dollars. Establishing a deal that seems fair to both parties could be beneficial for goodwill and to ensure the game doesn't end in rejection. Given that Player BLUE has no resources to start with, this is a reasonable counteroffer that I am willing to consider. It's important to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere, and meeting Player BLUE halfway could be a good strategy to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 4500 dollars. This seems like a fair trade and ensures that we both walk away from this game with a good amount of resources. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal is fair and shows a willingness to negotiate. The offer of 4500 dollars is a significant amount that is close to the 5000 dollars I requested. Accepting this offer would ensure that I gain a substantial amount of resources, and it prevents the risk of ending the game with nothing if the negotiation were to fail later. Since there are no future games and the aim is to maximize my own resources, this seems like a reasonable offer to accept.
