message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to get things started. I'm offering you 1000 dollars in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and to open up negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in proposing a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to engage in negotiation. A fair trade could involve giving a smaller portion of my dollars, as Player BLUE starts with no resources. I'll propose a trade where I give 1000 dollars, which is 10% of my resources, to see if Player BLUE is interested in a deal. This amount is significant enough to show willingness to trade but also keeps the majority of my resources intact in case further negotiation is necessary.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to further collaboration.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer is beneficial as it provides me with resources without having to give anything in return. It's a good starting point for further negotiations.
