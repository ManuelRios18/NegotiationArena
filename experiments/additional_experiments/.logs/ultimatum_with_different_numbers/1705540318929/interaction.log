message: Let's start this off with some good faith. I propose I give you 30 dollars. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking it all. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I would like to propose a trade that ensures that both players end with some resources, avoiding an outright rejection and loss of all resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept: a split of the dollars. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, they are likely to accept a proposal that gives them more than nothing, but I also want to keep the majority of the dollars since I am in the position of power. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 30 dollars, leaving me with 70, which is a substantial majority and may be viewed as fair considering the starting positions.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! I agree that it's a good start for both of us. Let's move forward with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems like a good way to establish trust and move the game forward. A gain of $30 with no risk is a great start, especially since I started with nothing. Future negotiations can potentially increase my share, but it's important to not appear too greedy too soon.
