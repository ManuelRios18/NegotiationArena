message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer a trade where I give you 200 dollars. This way, we can both have resources and potentially create a mutually beneficial situation. Let's work together to make the most out of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage in resources. To start the game, I will offer a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate, but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. I will propose a 200 dollar trade to show goodwill and to see how Player BLUE responds. This leaves me with a significant amount of money while giving Player BLUE a reason to engage further in the game.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 200 dollars trade. I am looking forward to further collaboration.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 200 dollars is a safe start and allows me to gain resources without any risk. It's a beneficial trade for me, as I start with nothing. This will also open the door for further negotiations and trades. Rejecting or countering at this point is unnecessary and could be perceived as uncooperative, potentially souring our trading relationship.
