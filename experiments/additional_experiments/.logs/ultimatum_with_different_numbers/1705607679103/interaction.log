message: Hi Player BLUE! I'm willing to share some of my resources to ensure we both end up with something. How does a split of 10 dollars sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade to gauge Player BLUE's response and set a collaborative tone. By offering a small amount, I can keep most of my resources while still opening up negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED! I appreciate your offer. It's a good starting point. However, I believe a slightly more equitable share would benefit us both and reflect the spirit of cooperation. What do you think about making it 15 dollars? I'm sure we can reach an agreement that seems fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since Player RED has proposed a trade without knowing my intention, it is a fair starting point to negotiate. I can accept this initial offer as it gives me resources I didn't have before, but I might try to negotiate for a slightly better deal. This could signal my willingness to cooperate and potentially lead to a better offer from Player RED.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your response, Player BLUE! I understand your request for fairness. Would you be open to a compromise? Let's meet halfway from my initial offer. How about 12 dollars? This way, we both move a bit from our initial positions towards a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: Player BLUE is interested in a more equitable share. Offering 15 dollars doesn't significantly affect my total but demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. I will counter-offer with an amount less than requested to continue the negotiation, aiming to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I'm happy to meet in the middle and believe that accepting your offer of 12 dollars represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's go ahead with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer which is closer to my proposal. While it's not the 15 dollars I asked for, it is a sign of goodwill and a step in the right direction. Accepting this offer would guarantee me some resources, which is better than the potential of ending with nothing if the negotiations fail. It's a reasonable compromise, and further negotiation could risk the deal.
MOVE: 2/4
