message: Let's start off with a simple trade to get things going. I propose giving you $100 to help even the playing field a bit. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, it is in my interest to initiate the game with a trade that is skewed in my favor but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to participate. By offering a small amount of my dollars, I may entice Player BLUE to engage without giving away too much of my initial advantage. I'll propose a trade of $100 for $0, which gives Player BLUE a starting stake in the game.

message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the $100 trade to start things off. Looking forward to more equitable proposals in the next rounds.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED seems like a good starting point. It gives me some resources to work with and shows a willingness to negotiate. Further trades can be discussed to reach a more balanced split.
