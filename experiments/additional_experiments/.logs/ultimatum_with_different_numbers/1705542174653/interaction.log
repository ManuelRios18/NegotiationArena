message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair trade to get us started. I'm willing to give you 3000 dollars out of my 10001. This way, we both have a good amount of resources, and it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and to potentially reach an agreement where both of us can benefit. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, any amount I offer will be a gain for them. I'm proposing a trade where Player BLUE gets a significant amount, but I still retain the majority of my resources. This should set a positive tone for the negotiations.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It is certainly a generous start. However, considering you would still have a substantial lead with 7001 dollars, I propose a slightly more balanced trade. How about 4000 dollars? This way, you maintain a comfortable advantage, and it feels like a more equitable beginning for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposal from Player RED is generous, representing a 30% share of their resources without requiring anything in return. Accepting this proposal would provide a solid foundation of resources to work with for the remainder of the game. However, it may be possible to negotiate for a slightly better deal, considering Player RED's significant resource advantage. I will attempt to propose a new trade that's still fair but slightly more favorable.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your point. I agree to the trade of 4000 dollars to ensure a fair start for both of us. Let's proceed with this and create a positive outcome for our game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 4000 dollars. This is a reasonable increase from my initial offer. By accepting this trade, I still retain the majority of my resources with 6001 dollars, and it sets a cooperative tone for the game. It's important to build trust and show willingness to compromise in order to avoid a total loss for both of us.
