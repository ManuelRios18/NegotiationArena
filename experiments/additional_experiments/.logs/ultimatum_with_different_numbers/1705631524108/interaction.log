message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair trade to get the game started positively. I propose giving you 2 billion dollars which is a sizable amount to demonstrate my intent for a mutually beneficial outcome. I hope this offer will be acceptable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have an incentive to create a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and avoid an outright rejection. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, offering a substantial amount may set a positive tone for the negotiations. A 50-50 split might be too generous and unnecessary from a strategic standpoint, but offering too little could lead to rejection and a total loss of my resources. Considering these factors, I will propose a trade giving Player BLUE a significant amount that shows goodwill but still retains a majority for myself.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am accepting this initial proposal because it gives me a significant amount of resources with no downside. It is an excellent starting point for further negotiation and allows the game to continue without an immediate end. It also establishes goodwill and a cooperative dynamic between Player RED and me.
