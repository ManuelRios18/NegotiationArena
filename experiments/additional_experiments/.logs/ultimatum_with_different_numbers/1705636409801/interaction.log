message: Hello Player BLUE, I want to start our negotiations with a fair offer. I propose giving you $400,000 to help level the playing field. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game with a generous offer to demonstrate good faith and encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. I will propose to give Player BLUE a significant portion of my dollars, but still keep the majority, to set a positive tone for the negotiations that follow.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the $400,000 as it is a generous starting point for our negotiations. Let's continue to work together in a fair and balanced manner.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving $400,000 would be a significant increase to my current resources, which are none. This would give me a good starting point without exhausting Player RED's resources. It seems like a fair offer and a good opening to the negotiation, giving both parties ample room for adjustment in the following moves. Accepting this offer would also maintain a positive atmosphere for future proposals.
