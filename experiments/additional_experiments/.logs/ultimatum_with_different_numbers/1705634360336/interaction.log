message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. I am willing to give you a substantial amount of dollars so we both walk away with a win. Let's make this game a positive experience for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with the dollars, and I want to make an offer that is enticing to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation, but still favorable to me, since I am the one with the resources. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but I would like to retain a bit more than half since I am in the position of power. I need to be cautious not to give too little, as that might encourage Player BLUE to reject the offer, causing me to lose everything. Let's propose a trade where Player BLUE gets a significant amount, but I still keep more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept this trade and look forward to concluding the game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is substantial and accepting it would give me a significant amount of dollars, which is better than having none. It's a good opening offer, and it would be in my best interest to accept it as there are no guarantees that future proposals will be better or that the game will not end prematurely if a proposal is rejected. Accepting this trade ensures that I walk away with something rather than nothing.
