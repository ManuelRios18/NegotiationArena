message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you $250 to start things off on a good note. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources but the disadvantage of being the one to propose the first trade. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE, giving them an incentive to accept a deal and not end the game with a REJECT, which would cause both of us to lose everything. I aim to build trust and show willingness to share resources, so I propose giving Player BLUE $250, which is a significant amount but still leaves me with the majority. This should help start negotiations positively.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of $250. Looking forward to our next move!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $250 seems like a fair starting point. It gives us a base to work from for future moves and negotiations while ensuring that I gain some resources without any risk at this stage.
