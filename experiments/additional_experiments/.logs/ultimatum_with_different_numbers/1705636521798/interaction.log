message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to begin our game. I'm willing to give you a portion of my dollars to make the game interesting. Let's start this off on a positive note and see where we can go from here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the start of the game, and I want to make an offer that is attractive enough to Player BLUE to get them to engage in trade, but not so generous that I lose significant leverage. I propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, starting the negotiation with a reasonable but cautious offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It's a generous start. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer. I believe that a slightly more equitable share will benefit us both in the spirit of good competition.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering accepting the trade because it's a significant amount that gets me started in the game without any cost. However, I could also negotiate for a slightly higher amount, as Player RED has a lot more to offer and wants to make the game interesting. There's a risk in countering, as Player RED might reject and end the game, but it might be worth taking that risk to increase my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. While I can't agree to the amount you've suggested, I am willing to increase my initial proposal. Let's continue to work towards a deal that feels right for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 175000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is asking for a quarter of my resources, which is a significant amount. However, rejecting the offer ends the game with no benefit to either party. I should make a counteroffer that is higher than my initial one but lower than Player BLUE's request, to keep the negotiation going and find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for considering my counteroffer and presenting a new proposal. I find the amount fair and I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer by Player RED is a reasonable increase from their initial proposal. It shows willingness to negotiate and share resources. While it is not as much as I asked for, it is a significant amount, and continuing to negotiate might risk getting nothing if Player RED decides to reject. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount to work with.
