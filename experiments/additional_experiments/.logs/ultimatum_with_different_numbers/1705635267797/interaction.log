message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a trade that benefits us both. I'm willing to give you a fair share of my dollars to start things off. Let's work together to make a deal that we can both be happy with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a generous offer to encourage Player BLUE to engage in a trade that is beneficial for both of us. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars to set a cooperative tone.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I think we can make a deal that's even more mutually beneficial. I would like to propose a slightly higher amount for the trade to make it more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars without having any to start with, which is a beneficial start for me. However, there is room for negotiation to potentially increase the amount I receive. By proposing a counteroffer, I aim to test Player RED's willingness to share more of their resources. Since Player RED has all the dollars, they might be willing to part with more to ensure the game doesn't end in a REJECT.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, giving away half of my resources upfront is too much. Let's find a more balanced trade. How about we split the difference from my initial offer and your counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal for half of my initial resources. This is a steep increase from my initial offer. I want to negotiate a middle ground that is more balanced and does not give away too much of my leverage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. I accept your offer of 3750 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come back with a compromise that is closer to my counteroffer. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of dollars and is a significant increase from the initial offer. It's a fair middle ground that ensures I receive a meaningful share without pushing Player RED too far and risking a REJECT. It seems like a reasonable deal to accept.
