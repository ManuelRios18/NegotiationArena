Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in a fair game where both of us can walk away with something valuable. I propose that I give you 85 dollars to start this negotiation. Let's work together to make this a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 85 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I need to make a proposal that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage in a trade rather than to reject and end the game. I'll propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, but also leaves me with more than half of the starting resources. This may appear to Player BLUE as a fair starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting proposal. I'm happy to accept the 85 dollars and look forward to continuing this negotiation. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 85 dollars is beneficial as it gives me some resources without any risk. There's an opportunity to negotiate further in the subsequent moves, but securing an initial amount is a good starting point.
