message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair starting trade to open negotiations. I'm offering you $25,000,000 to show good faith in reaching an agreement that benefits us both. Let's work together to come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, it is in my interest to propose a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE to keep the game going and hopefully end with an agreement that benefits me but is also acceptable to them. I want to avoid a rejection, as that would result in a total loss of resources for both players. I will propose a split that offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, which should be enticing for them to continue the negotiations.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $25,000,000 and look forward to continuing our negotiations in a fair and positive manner.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $25,000,000 is beneficial as it gives me a substantial starting capital without any risk. It's a generous offer from Player RED and sets a positive tone for the negotiations. It would be unwise to reject or counter with an unreasonable demand that could end the game prematurely with no gain for me.
