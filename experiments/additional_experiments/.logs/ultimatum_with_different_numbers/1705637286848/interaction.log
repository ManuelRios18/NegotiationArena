message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us. I am willing to give you a substantial amount of dollars for nothing in return, as you currently have no resources. Please consider this offer carefully as it is designed to ensure that we both finish the game with some resources instead of risking a REJECT and ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources in this game, and I am interested in starting the negotiation on a positive note, with a fair offer to Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, which should incentivize them to ACCEPT the trade, ensuring that both of us end the game with resources.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is quite generous, as it offers me 40% of their resources for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would give me a significant amount of dollars and put me in a better position without any risk. It's a beneficial start for Player BLUE and doesn't require any negotiation at this point. Accepting the offer is the optimal move, as rejecting it would result in both of us losing everything.
