message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive some dollars to even out the playing field. Let's start with a fair amount and see if we can come to an agreement. What are your thoughts?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: I am proposing a trade that seems fair to start negotiations. I will offer Player BLUE a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing to see if they are interested in cooperating for mutual benefit. Offering too much could be risky as it may not leave me with enough, and offering too little may not entice Player BLUE to accept. I'll propose a trade where Player BLUE receives a significant amount, but I still retain the majority of my resources.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept the trade of 250,000 dollars. It's a great start to leveling the playing field. Let's continue this positive momentum.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal of 250,000 dollars is beneficial as it provides me with resources I didn't previously have. There is no downside to accepting this offer, and it does not preclude negotiating for more in subsequent trades. Rejecting or proposing a new trade at this point risks ending the game with nothing.
