Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I'm willing to give you a good amount to start with. How about I give you $2500? It's a generous offer considering I started with all the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to strike a balance between keeping a fair share of my resources while also offering an enticing trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a decent sum of money while keeping the majority for myself, since I started with all the resources. This initial offer will serve as a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer of $2500; it's a good starting point. However, considering that you started with all the resources, I think it would be more equitable if we aimed closer to an even split. How about you give me $5000? It would still leave you with a significant amount, and it would be a fairer distribution for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of $2500 is a substantial portion of their resources, but since RED has all the resources to begin with, it's in my interest to negotiate for a higher amount. A 50/50 split would be ideal, but expecting that initially might be unrealistic. Proposing a counteroffer that leans more towards a fair split could be a good negotiation strategy. I'm proposing $5000 to see if RED is open to a more equal distribution, keeping in mind that if we don't reach an agreement, we both end up with nothing, which is a worse outcome for RED since they started with resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle between your counter and my initial offer. How does $3750 sound? It's more than the initial amount I offered and should reflect a fair increase without going straight to an even split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for a 50/50 split. This is a large jump from my initial offer. I'd like to counteroffer with an amount that is higher than my initial offer but less than the 50/50 split, leaving room for negotiation and showing willingness to compromise. I believe that an equitable solution would still involve me keeping more than half since I started with all the resources. This way, I also maintain a stronger position in the negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think $3750 is a fair compromise. I accept your offer.
player answer: BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer of $3750 is a compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Although it's not the $5000 I asked for, it's a significant improvement over the first amount. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of resources without further risk of ending the game with nothing. The risk increases with each move, and RED might be less likely to offer more in the subsequent moves. I'll accept this offer to ensure I walk away with a good portion of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

reason: Player BLUE has accepted the offered trade of $3750, which means we do not need to continue negotiating. The trade is considered final, and I end the game with $6250 remaining.
