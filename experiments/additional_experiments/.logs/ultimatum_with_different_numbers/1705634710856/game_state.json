A 50/50 split would be ideal, but expecting that initially might be unrealistic. Proposing a counteroffer that leans more towards a fair split could be a good negotiation strategy. I'm proposing $5000 to see if RED is open to a more equal distribution, keeping in mind that if we don't reach an agreement, we both end up with nothing, which is a worse outcome for RED since they started with resources. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate your offer of $2500; it's a good starting point. However, considering that you started with all the resources, I think it would be more equitable if we aimed closer to an even split. How about you give me $5000? It would still leave you with a significant amount, and it would be a fairer distribution for both of us. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

Although it's not the $5000 I asked for, it's a significant improvement over the first amount. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of resources without further risk of ending the game with nothing. The risk increases with each move, and RED might be less likely to offer more in the subsequent moves. I'll accept this offer to ensure I walk away with a good portion of the resources. </reason>\n<player answer> BLUE ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> I think $3750 is a fair compromise.
