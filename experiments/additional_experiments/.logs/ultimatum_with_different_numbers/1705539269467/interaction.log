message: I propose a trade that I believe is fair for both of us. I'm willing to share my resources with you so that we can both end this game positively. How does a split of 60 dollars for you and 39 for me sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that seems fair and enticing to Player BLUE to start the game on a positive note, encouraging cooperation and a successful trade for us both. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, but I will still keep the majority. By offering a significant amount, I hope to build trust and show that I'm willing to share resources, which might lead to Player BLUE accepting the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and it's a generous start. However, I would like to counter-propose a trade that gives me a slightly larger share, considering I'm starting with nothing. How about 65 dollars for me and 34 for you? This way, we both benefit significantly from the trade, and it's still in your favor overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the trade seems to be a good starting point for negotiations. It gives me resources I didn't have before, and it might build trust for further trades. However, since this is a negotiation and I'm starting with no resources, I could try proposing a slightly better deal for myself to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate more in my favor.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is fair, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. I accept the trade of 65 dollars for you and 34 dollars for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is still within acceptable limits, and I will still retain a significant portion of the dollars. It's important to maintain goodwill and show flexibility to ensure the game ends positively for both parties. By accepting this trade, I am still left with a considerable amount, and the game can conclude successfully without further risk of rejection.
