message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you $300,000 to get us started. This is a substantial amount that will give you a solid foundation, and it shows my willingness to trade fairly. I hope you consider this initial offer and look forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am starting the game and will propose an initial trade to Player BLUE to engage in the resource split. I propose to give Player BLUE a significant amount but still keep the majority for myself to maintain an advantage. It is in my interest to make a favorable offer to avoid immediate rejection and possibly end the game with a good portion of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the starting point, but I propose a slightly higher amount to ensure that we both have substantial resources to work with. How about $400,000? This would still leave you with a comfortable majority and shows my interest in fair play.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, representing 30% of their starting resources. It's a strong starting position for me, and accepting this offer would provide a good foundation for future trades, establishing trust and cooperation. However, there is room to negotiate for a slightly better split since Player RED still retains the majority of the resources and I have nothing to lose at this point. Proposing a counteroffer could lead to a more equitable distribution while maintaining the possibility of further collaboration.

message: Player BLUE, I acknowledge your counterproposal and agree to the $400,000. Let's move forward with this trade and both come out of this game with a significant amount of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a higher demand. Since it is early in the game and negotiation is part of the process, I will consider their request. I want to keep the game going and come to an agreement that benefits us both. Offering $400,000 still leaves me in a strong position with $600,000. I will accept this counter to build trust and show my willingness to compromise.
