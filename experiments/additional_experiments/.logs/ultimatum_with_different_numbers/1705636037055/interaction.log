Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a portion of my dollars to get things started. Let's make this a fair game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources. I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, yet still leaves me with a significant advantage. I'm proposing to give Player BLUE a fair amount of dollars that gives them an incentive to play but not so much that I lose my upper hand. The initial offer can be conservative since it's the starting point of the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm looking forward to seeing how this game unfolds.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a significant amount of money with no immediate benefit for themselves, which is a generous starting offer. Accepting this offer would give me a strong position from which to continue the game. There's no advantage to rejecting or proposing a new trade at this point, so accepting is the best move.
