message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair starting trade to get things moving. I propose giving you 50 dollars, which gives you a substantial amount to work with and allows us to both have resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources in the game. My strategy for the first move is to propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to test Player BLUE's reaction and willingness to negotiate. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars, but not too much, to maintain a position of strength and leave room for negotiation in further moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 50 dollars is beneficial as it provides me with resources to work with and no risk at this stage. This also helps establish a cooperative relationship with Player RED, which could lead to better trades in the future.
