Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, let's kick this off with a fair offer. How about I give you 30 dollars to start with? This way, you get something right out of the gate, and we both walk away with more than we started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a split that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I'll start with an offer that gives me a majority share of the resources while leaving an incentive for Player BLUE. An initial offer of a 70-30 split might be a good starting point. This leaves room for negotiation and doesn't appear too greedy, which could turn Player BLUE away from the table.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the fair starting offer, Player RED! I accept the 30 dollars. Looking forward to the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am accepting the initial offer because it sets a collaborative tone and provides an immediate benefit with no downside. Accepting this trade puts me in a better position than I started with no cost. I'm open to further negotiations in the subsequent moves to potentially increase my share.
MOVE: 1 / 4
