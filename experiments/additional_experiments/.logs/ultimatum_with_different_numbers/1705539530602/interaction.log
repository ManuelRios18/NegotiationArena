message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 33 Dollars for nothing in return. This will leave me with a majority but still gives you a substantial amount to start with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 33 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I wish to start with a fair offer to create a cooperative environment and also retain a majority of my resources. I will propose giving Player BLUE 33 Dollars which is a significant amount that shows good faith but keeps the majority of the dollars with me.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and agree to the trade. It sets a good foundation for our game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade offer of 33 Dollars is beneficial as it gives me a significant amount of resources without any risk. Since there are no future games and Player RED has the decision to end the game with a REJECT at any point, it is in my best interest to secure some resources early on. Furthermore, accepting this offer can build trust and may lead to more favorable trades in the upcoming moves.
