message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you some dollars to get us started on a positive note. How about I give you 10 dollars to begin with? This leaves me with a majority but gives you a significant amount to make it worth your while.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I should propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also appealing to Player BLUE to prevent an outright rejection. Starting with a modest offer allows room for negotiation in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's a decent starting offer from Player RED. By accepting, I will have some resources to negotiate with in the subsequent moves. I can always propose a new trade next.
