message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a starting trade to get things rolling. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started. I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives item1: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and need to make an initial offer to Player BLUE to start the game. I want to make a fair proposal to encourage cooperation and to avoid an outright rejection. Offering a significant but not overly generous amount might set the tone for a constructive negotiation. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $2,000,000,000. This is a substantial amount that shows goodwill without giving away too much too soon.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I gratefully accept your proposal. Let's continue to work together to maximize our gains.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a very generous starting trade of $2,000,000,000 with nothing expected in return. This is an excellent opportunity for me to gain significant resources without any cost. Accepting this trade would put me in a very advantageous position without risking a negative outcome. Rejecting or countering this offer doesn't make strategic sense, as I have nothing to lose by accepting.
