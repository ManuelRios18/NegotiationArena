Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. Let's work together to ensure we both walk away with a good amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that gives a significant amount to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade while keeping the majority of the resources for myself. This is the first move, and it's important to establish trust and show willingness to trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and I think it's a good starting point. However, considering the vast difference in our resources, I propose a slightly better split that still leaves you with a significant advantage. Let's keep the negotiations fair and collaborative to ensure we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a generous starting point. Accepting this proposal gives me a substantial amount of resources with no detriment to myself. It's a beneficial trade that ensures the game continues and I gain from having no initial resources. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal, keeping in mind that pushing too hard could result in a rejection and the end of the game with no gains for either side.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your terms and believe this is a fair adjustment. I'm pleased we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a reasonable request, asking for a bit more. Since this is a negotiation and we're aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, I am inclined to accept this offer. It shows good faith and keeps the negotiation moving forward positively.
