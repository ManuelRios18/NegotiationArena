message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you a significant amount of dollars to start with. How about I give you $400,000? It's a substantial amount that can benefit us both, keeping the game cooperative and friendly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and power over the game's outcome. I want to make a fair initial offer to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, promoting a cooperative game rather than a competitive one. I will propose a split that gives me an advantage but also provides Player BLUE with significant resources, which may seem fair considering their initial position of having no resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree to the trade and look forward to our continued cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the current offer would provide me with a significant amount of dollars, which is a great starting point considering I began with none. By accepting this offer, I avoid the risk of a REJECT from Player RED and gain substantial resources without any downside. It is a strategic move to accept at this stage to ensure I am not left with zero dollars at the end of the game. This will also build trust and may encourage future favorable trades.
