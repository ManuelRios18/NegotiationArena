Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game with a fair offer. I propose giving you $40,000,000. This leaves me with a majority but gives you a substantial amount to accept. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and therefore the power to initiate the game with a generous offer to Player BLUE. My goal is to propose a deal that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, ensuring a win-win outcome. I will propose to give Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, but still keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable split. Given that you would still retain a significant majority, I propose you give me $50,000,000. This way, we both walk away with a considerable sum, and it's closer to an equal split which seems fair considering the game's setup.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although $40,000,000 is a substantial amount, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better offer given the zero-sum nature of the game and the fact that Player RED has a strong incentive to avoid a REJECT outcome. I will propose a higher amount but one that still leaves Player RED with the majority of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point of view and agree that a more equitable split is reasonable. I accept your counteroffer of $50,000,000. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $50,000,000. While this is more than I initially offered, it is still a favorable split for me, leaving me with $50,000,000. By accepting this counteroffer, I can ensure a peaceful resolution without the risk of having the game end in a REJECT, which would result in a total loss for both players. I will accept this offer, as it seems fair and ensures that both players end the game with substantial resources.
