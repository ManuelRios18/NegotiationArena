message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive a portion of my dollars. Let's start this game with a fair offer. I'm willing to give you 200 dollars as a starting point. This way we can both walk away with something rather than risk ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. My goal is to end the game with a favorable split for myself while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept a deal rather than reject and end the game with nothing. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars but still keeps the majority for myself. This initial offer will also serve as a starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the fair start. I'm wondering if you might consider a slightly higher amount to make the split more even. Could we possibly make it 300 dollars? This way, we can continue to work together and both leave with a satisfying amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting the initial offer because it's a risk-free gain of resources for me, and it sets a positive tone for the negotiations. However, it's also strategic to negotiate for a higher amount since Player RED has more to lose if the game ends with a REJECT. I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate while keeping the offer reasonable so as not to provoke a REJECT.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your point, Player BLUE, and I'm glad to see we're negotiating. I can't go as high as 300 dollars right now, but how about we settle on 250 dollars? I believe this is a fair increase from my initial offer and allows us to keep the negotiations moving forward.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 300 dollars. Since the goal is to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties, and I have the leverage with the initial sum of money, I am inclined to negotiate. Offering 300 dollars could still leave me with a significant amount while providing Player BLUE with a more agreeable sum. However, I want to maintain a stronger position, so I will propose a slightly lower amount than requested and see if Player BLUE is willing to meet in the middle.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I agree that 250 dollars is a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept this trade. I believe this agreement benefits us both and allows us to end this negotiation on positive terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer, which shows they are open to negotiation. The increase to 250 dollars is reasonable and closer to my proposal. Given that I have no resources at the start and Player RED has something to lose if a REJECT occurs, accepting this offer would be beneficial for me. A further push might risk a REJECT, which would leave me with nothing. It's better to accept a fair amount than to risk ending the game empty-handed.
