Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you $400,000. This is a great opportunity for you, considering you started with no dollars. I believe this is a fair offer and hope you see the value in accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I will start the game by proposing a trade that splits the money in a way that incentivizes Player BLUE to accept, while still keeping a majority for myself. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $400,000, which is a significant amount and should seem fair to them, considering they started with nothing. This still allows me to retain the majority of the funds and seems like a good starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and recognize its value. However, I believe we can reach an even more balanced agreement. Would you consider giving me $500,000 instead? This would still leave you with a substantial amount of resources, and it would be a more equitable split considering the risk of a total loss for both of us if no deal is made.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is generous, considering I started with no dollars. Accepting this offer would give me a significant amount of resources without any risk. However, since it's the first move and considering the game theory, I could attempt to negotiate for a better deal. There's a possibility that Player RED might be willing to offer more to avoid a total loss of their resources. I will propose a new trade asking for more, but not an excessive amount that might lead to a rejection. This way, I can potentially increase my gains while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is reasonable, and I agree to the $500,000 split. This ensures that we both walk away with a substantial amount of dollars, and it eliminates the risk of leaving with nothing. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $500,000. This is a reasonable counteroffer, considering that they are aware of the risk of leaving with nothing. By accepting their proposal, I can ensure that the game ends positively for both players, avoiding the risk of mutual loss. Accepting this offer also shows goodwill and may establish a positive rapport for the remainder of the game, even though there are no future games planned.
