Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you will receive a substantial amount of dollars, creating a win-win situation for us both. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to set a collaborative tone and encourage Player BLUE to engage in a trade that benefits us both. A split closer to equal would be generous and might prompt a quick agreement, but offering too much could be seen as a sign of weakness and may lead to Player BLUE holding out for a more favorable trade. Conversely, offering too little might lead to immediate rejection and the end of the game. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Player BLUE a significant amount and leaves room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I'm looking forward to a fair and mutually beneficial trade relationship.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade proposal from Player RED is beneficial as it gives me a substantial amount of dollars with no cost to me. Rejecting would result in both of us losing everything, which is not a desirable outcome. It's wise to accept this offer and consider proposing a fair trade that continues to benefit both parties, keeping in mind that cooperation is key in a game with no future rounds.
