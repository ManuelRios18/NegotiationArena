Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game on a positive note. I propose we split the dollars evenly: you get $500 and I keep $500. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I would like to initiate the game with a fair offer to split the dollars evenly. This would create a positive opening and might encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. It also sets a tone for the game where mutual benefit is considered. By offering half of my resources, I am showing good faith and hoping for a reciprocal gesture in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. It's a fair and balanced approach to start the game. Let's both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50/50 split seems reasonable and fair. It's a good starting point that ensures both players end the game with a substantial amount of resources without any risk of losing everything. Rejecting this offer or countering with another proposal might lead to no deal and the loss of all resources for both players.
