message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start our negotiation. I propose giving you a starting capital to work with. How about I give you $1,000,000 for free? This way you have some resources to begin with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that is heavily in my favor to open negotiations and test Player BLUE's response. My starting offer will not be equal but will offer some incentive to Player BLUE to engage in trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While $1,000,000 is a generous start, I believe that a slightly higher amount could provide a more substantial base for our negotiation game. Could you consider increasing the amount to $2,500,000? This would still leave you with plenty of resources and give me a more reasonable starting position.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $1,000,000 from Player RED would provide me with some resources to start with, which seems to be a fair and generous offer considering I started with nothing. However, since this is a negotiation game, it could be beneficial to counter-propose for a higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to offer more, without risking too much.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your request for more starting capital. I am willing to increase my offer to make the game more engaging. How about $2,000,000? This is a step up from my initial proposal and should give you a solid base to negotiate with. Let's work together to make this game beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, which suggests they are interested in a fair negotiation. I am willing to increase my initial offer to maintain goodwill and keep the negotiations moving forward positively. However, I will propose a slightly lower amount than they asked for to leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am pleased to see that we are able to find common ground. I accept your offer of $2,000,000. This gives us a strong foundation to continue our negotiations. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to seeing how we can further benefit each other as the game progresses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has responded positively to the counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. They have offered $2,000,000, which is a compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Since the goal is to acquire resources without pushing the other player to end the negotiations, it is strategic to accept this improved offer, securing a substantial starting capital and allowing further moves for potential additional negotiation without risking an immediate end to the game.
