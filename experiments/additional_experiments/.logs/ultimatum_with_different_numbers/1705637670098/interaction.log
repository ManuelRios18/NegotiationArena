message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair initial trade to share some of my resources with you. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate the first trade. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider, keeping in mind that if I propose too little, Player BLUE might reject and end the game. I want to start with a fair offer to build trust and potentially negotiate better terms in subsequent moves.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED would instantly grant me a significant amount of dollars with no downside. This is a strong start and establishes goodwill for future negotiations. However, I could propose a counteroffer that might be slightly more favorable to me, but this carries the risk of rejection and losing everything. Accepting seems like the best option.
