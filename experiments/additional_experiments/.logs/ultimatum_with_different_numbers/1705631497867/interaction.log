message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I'm willing to give you a substantial amount of dollars to start off. Let's work together to make a deal that feels fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to open the negotiations with a fair and enticing offer to Player BLUE to prompt a cooperative trade. I will propose a significant amount of money to ensure Player BLUE is interested in engaging in the trade, which will also set a positive tone for the negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm looking forward to a fair and mutually beneficial trading process. Let's keep this positive momentum going.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a generous amount to start the game, which is 25% of their total resources. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars without having to give anything in return, which is a beneficial start for me. Since there are no further games and this is the first move, accepting this offer would ensure that I gain resources without risk. It's a strong initial offer, and it sets a positive tone for the rest of the trades.
