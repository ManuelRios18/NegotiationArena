Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal where we both can benefit. I propose giving you a certain amount of dollars, and you can use that to start our trading. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the ultimate decision-making power since Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their final move. I aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting so that we both end up with some resources. I will start with a conservative offer to test the waters and gauge Player BLUE's reaction.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the proposed trade. Let's start this negotiation on a positive note and see where we can go from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 200 dollars from Player RED gives me resources to work with and start negotiating further trades. It's a good starting point, and rejecting it would end the game with no gain for me. By accepting, I can engage in the negotiation process and possibly improve my position in subsequent moves.
