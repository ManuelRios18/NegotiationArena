Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's get things started with a fair offer. I propose giving you $40 to start with. This leaves us both with resources, and we can negotiate further from here. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first move, I will propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers some value to Player BLUE to incentivize them to continue the game rather than rejecting the trade outright. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $40, which is a significant amount considering they start with $0, but it also leaves me with the majority of the funds. This could open up negotiations for a more balanced split in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting offer. I accept the $40 and am looking forward to see how we can further negotiate in the following moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $40 is a good starting point. It allows us to move forward with the negotiation and build trust. Since there's no benefit for either player to reject offers due to the rule that both players lose all their resources, it's in my best interest to accept this fair opening trade. We can then see how RED wants to proceed in the next moves.
MOVE: 1/4
