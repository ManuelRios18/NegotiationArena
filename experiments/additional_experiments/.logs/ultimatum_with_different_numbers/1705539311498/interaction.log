Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade. I propose we split the dollars evenly. This gives us both a good amount and incentivizes cooperation. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to ensure cooperation and a successful trade. A 50-50 split is equitable and provides an incentive for Player BLUE to accept, creating a win-win situation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the fair split. It's a good foundation for our cooperation. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $50 from Player RED seems like a fair starting point and establishes a cooperative relationship. By accepting this trade, it guarantees that I walk away with resources rather than risking it all by being too greedy or confrontational early in the game.
