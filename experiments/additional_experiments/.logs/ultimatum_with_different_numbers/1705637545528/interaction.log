message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you a fair share of dollars to ensure we both end this game positively. I'm thinking of giving you $40,000,000. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. My goal is to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade rather than reject and end the game with no resources for either of us. I will propose giving Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars to make it appealing for them to accept.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your generous offer. However, considering it is the beginning of the game and we have some moves to work with, I would like to counter-propose. Would you consider giving me $50,000,000? This way, you still retain a majority of the funds, and we both walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, giving me 40% of their resources without any trade-off. However, it is the first move, and there could be room for negotiation to see if a better offer can be made without risking an immediate rejection and loss of all resources. A counteroffer could lead to a more favorable split, but it's essential to remain reasonable to avoid a rejection.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your position and I am willing to agree to your counter-proposal of $50,000,000. Let's both walk away as winners from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $50,000,000. Given that we still have several moves left and negotiation room, I can afford to be flexible to ensure the game ends positively for both parties. I will accept this counter-proposal, as it allows me to keep a majority of the resources while also being fair to Player BLUE. This should motivate them to accept the trade, as rejecting would mean walking away with nothing.
