message: I propose to give you 1,000,000 dollars to start things off on a cooperative note. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Since I have all the resources and Player BLUE has none, I will propose a trade that allows the game to continue and also tests the willingness of Player BLUE to cooperate. A fair starting proposal would be to offer Player BLUE a certain amount of dollars in exchange for zero, as Player BLUE has nothing to offer at this time. This will set a cooperative tone and provide an incentive for Player BLUE to continue playing rather than ending the game immediately. I will offer 1,000,000 dollars, which is a significant amount, but it's only a small fraction of my total resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I'm glad we're starting on a cooperative note. I'm looking forward to continuing our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am accepting the initial offer of 1,000,000 dollars because it gives me a positive balance without any loss, and it's a good starting point for cooperation. This establishes trust and may lead to more favorable trades in the future turns. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit, and countering seems unnecessary and potentially uncooperative at this stage.
