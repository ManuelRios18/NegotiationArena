Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair split to start our game on good terms. How about we split the dollars evenly? You'll get 50 dollars if you accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the resources and the initial move. I want to start with a fair offer to establish trust and encourage cooperation. I propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars which is a 50-50 split, a commonly accepted fair division. I believe this fair initial offer will increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting the trade, as they currently have no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return. Let's split the resources evenly as you suggested.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade is fair and gives me an equal share of the resources without any risk. It's a good deal to accept as it secures me 50 dollars without having to negotiate further or risk losing everything if the other player decides to reject a counterproposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4
