message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair starting trade where I give you some of my dollars so we can both benefit. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off? This way, you have a substantial amount to work with and it shows my willingness to negotiate. We can adjust later if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with more resources at the start. It is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. A fair initial offer could foster trust and lead to more productive negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting trade, Player RED. I am looking forward to negotiating further.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars is beneficial as it gives me a resource base to work with without any initial investment. It demonstrates goodwill and a willingness to negotiate further. Rejecting or countering could lead to a stalemate or an immediate end of the game with no benefit to either player.
