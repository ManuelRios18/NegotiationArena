message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a portion of my dollars to get this game started on a positive note. Let's work together to ensure we both end up with a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As the first move, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a portion of my dollars. This will initiate the trading process, giving Player BLUE resources to work with and setting a cooperative tone for subsequent moves. By not being too greedy and offering a fair amount, I hope to establish trust and encourage Player BLUE to accept a trade that is beneficial for both of us.
