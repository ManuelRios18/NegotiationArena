message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that will give you a substantial amount of dollars to start with, which is a win-win for both of us. Let's make a fair and balanced game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to start with a fair offer to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept a trade and avoid an immediate end to the game with a REJECT. I will propose to give Player BLUE a portion of my dollars that is significant enough to be appealing but still allows me to retain the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to our next moves!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of dollars without any cost, which is beneficial for me. It's a generous first offer from Player RED, and it creates a positive starting point for the game. Accepting the trade will also extend the game, allowing for further negotiation and potential gains.
