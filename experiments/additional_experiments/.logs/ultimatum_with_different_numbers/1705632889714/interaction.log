Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade to get things started. How about I give you 40 dollars to help even things up a bit? This should give us a good starting point for further negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I want to make an opening offer that is generous enough to entice Player BLUE to engage in trade, but also leaves me with a majority of the resources. I'll propose a trade where I give Player BLUE some dollars to show good will and possibly set the tone for future negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the 40 dollars. Let's see how we can proceed from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars without giving anything in return is beneficial as it puts me on the board with resources. It's a non-threatening start to the negotiation and accepting would promote goodwill and potentially lead to more favorable trades in the future.
