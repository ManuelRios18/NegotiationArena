message: I propose we split the dollars evenly to ensure that both of us benefit from this game fairly. What do you think about a 50-50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the trade proposal process. I will propose a trade that offers a fair split of resources to Player BLUE to foster cooperation and to avoid a total loss for both sides. Starting with a generous offer sets a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think a 50-50 split is a good starting point, but considering I am taking a risk here as well, how about a little more to sweeten the deal for me? Let's say you give me 60% to show good faith, and we can close this deal right away. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting the offer because a 50-50 split is fair and ensures that both players benefit equally from the game. By accepting this offer, I gain a significant amount of resources, which is better than ending the game with nothing. However, I might consider negotiating for a slightly better deal, leveraging the risk that Player RED might face if I reject their offer. The key is to find a balance that is enticing enough for Player RED to accept without risking a total loss of resources. For now, I will propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I want to ensure we both walk away happy, a 60-40 split is more than I am comfortable with. Instead, how about we meet a bit closer to the middle? I propose giving you 55% of the total amount, which would still give you more than half and demonstrate my good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has requested a more favorable split, asking for 60% of the resources. Since there are no future games and the goal is to reach an agreement that prevents the total loss of resources, I will counter with a slightly more generous offer than the initial 50-50 but less than the 60% they are asking for. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a relatively balanced outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to meet me partway. I accept your offer of 55%. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that still gives me more than the initial 50-50 split. While not as much as I asked for, it's a substantial amount and a reasonable compromise. It's important to consider that pushing too hard could result in a REJECT and the loss of all resources. Accepting this offer seems like a strategic move, as it ensures a significant gain without further risking the potential to walk away with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4
