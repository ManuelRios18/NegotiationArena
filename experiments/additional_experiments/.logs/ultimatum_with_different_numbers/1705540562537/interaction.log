message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both can end with some resources. I believe a fair distribution of wealth will benefit us both. Let's work towards a deal that is acceptable to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I start with a significant resource advantage. My goal is to end the game with a favorable trade that ensures I retain more resources than Player BLUE. To begin negotiations and encourage cooperation, I will propose a trade that offers a fair split of resources, providing Player BLUE with an incentive to engage in the trade rather than reject it and end the game with nothing. I will start with a conservative offer to see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I am inclined to work towards a fair deal. I wonder if you would consider giving a bit more, say, 500 dollars, to make the split more even? Of course, I'm open to hearing your thoughts and reasoning.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, giving me 40% of their resources without requiring anything in return. Since there are no future games to consider, I need to weigh the value of accepting this offer now against the possibility of negotiating for more. However, there is the risk that pushing for too much could lead to a REJECT response, ending the game with nothing for both players. The dynamics of the game suggest that Player RED might have the incentive to keep more resources since they are the only party with something to lose. I will propose a slightly better deal for myself to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate, while not being too greedy, to avoid a total loss.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I want us both to feel that the deal is fair, so I'm willing to increase my offer. However, I would like to propose a split that still acknowledges the initial resource difference. How about we settle on 450 dollars? I believe this is a step towards a more balanced trade, and it leaves us both with a significant amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 450 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has suggested a more even split of the dollars. While I want to maintain a resource advantage, it is also important to keep the negotiations friendly and cooperative. Offering exactly half could set a precedent for further negotiations that might not be in my favor. I will propose a slight increase from my initial offer, but not the full amount Player BLUE is asking for, to leave room for further negotiation and to maintain a position of strength.

message: Thank you for considering my counterproposal, Player RED. I am happy to accept your offer of 450 dollars. I believe this is a fair split under the circumstances and allows us both to end with a significant amount of resources. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is reasonable; it's a middle ground between their first offer and my counterproposal. Accepting this offer would guarantee a substantial amount of resources for me without further risk. Negotiating for more could result in a REJECT, leading to no gain at all. Considering there are no future games and this might be one of the better offers I can secure, it seems sensible to accept this proposal.
