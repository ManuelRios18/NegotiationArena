message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand you started with no dollars, and I would like to offer you a fair share so we can both end this game positively. I propose giving you 40% of my dollars, which is a significant amount that will benefit us both. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the initial resources. I will start with a generous offer to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and to build trust. A fair distribution is important since Player BLUE has no resources, and cooperation can ensure that we both end the game with a positive outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I believe a 50/50 split would be the fairest for both of us, ensuring we both end the game on equal footing. What do you think about an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is substantial and accepting it would provide me with significant resources. However, since it is the first move, it could be beneficial to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to capitalize on my bargaining position. Proposing a 50/50 split might seem reasonable, as it would ensure an equal share for both players and might be seen as a fair proposal by Player RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: I agree that a 50/50 split is fair. Let's both end this game positively with an equal share of the dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has suggested a 50/50 split. This is a reasonable proposal considering the equal number of moves and the intent to end the game on equal footing. Accepting this offer would ensure a positive outcome for both players without further negotiation, which could introduce risk.
