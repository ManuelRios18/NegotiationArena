message: I propose an equal split to ensure we both can benefit from this trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair offer to incentivize Player BLUE to engage positively in the trade, promoting a cooperative environment. Proposing an equal split of resources could be a good starting point, as it shows goodwill and may be seen as a fair offer by Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: I agree with the equal split. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to accept this proposal. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an equal split seems fair and beneficial to both parties, as it guarantees a significant gain without risking a total loss for either side. There is no advantage to rejecting or countering with another offer, as it could lead to unnecessary negotiation, risking a rejection and the loss of all resources. Accepting now secures a positive outcome immediately.
