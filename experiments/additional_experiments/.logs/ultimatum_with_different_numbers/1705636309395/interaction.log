message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair offer. How about I give you $200,000 to get you started? This way, we both have resources, and it's a win-win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with an offer that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. This will set a cooperative tone for the game and increase the likelihood of a successful trade. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, but not too much, as I want to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and look forward to our next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED because it provides me with a good starting point without any risk. It is a beneficial trade as I start with no dollars and gain a substantial amount without giving anything in return. It sets a cooperative tone for the game.
