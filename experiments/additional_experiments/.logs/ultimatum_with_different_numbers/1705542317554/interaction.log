message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation with a fair offer. I propose giving you $200,000 to get things going. This is a significant amount that can help you, and it's made in good faith. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider but also leaves me with a significant portion of my resources. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars that demonstrates goodwill and opens the negotiation, but not so much that I lose my advantage right away. I propose giving Player BLUE $200,000. This leaves me with a majority of the funds but also gives Player BLUE a reason to engage in trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer and the spirit of fairness you're showing. I would like to propose a slight adjustment to make the split more equitable. Given that you have $1,000,000 and I have none, a 50-50 split would be truly fair. However, I understand that you're taking the risk here, so how about we settle for $300,000? This would still leave you with a large majority of the funds and show goodwill on both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous and provides a strong starting point for negotiation. Accepting it outright may not be the best strategic move, as it might set a precedent for future trades and possibly undervalue my negotiation position. Instead, proposing a counteroffer that asks for a bit more could lead to a middle ground that is beneficial for both sides. However, it's important to remain within reasonable limits to keep the negotiation friendly and avoid prompting a REJECT from Player RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your counteroffer of $300,000. It's important to me that we both feel the outcome is fair, and your proposed adjustment seems reasonable. Let's finalize this deal and both benefit from the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $300,000. While this is more than my initial offer, it is still a reasonable amount considering the total resources. Accepting this counteroffer could lead to a quick resolution and a guaranteed positive outcome for both players. Rejecting or countering again could lead to a stalemate or a REJECT from Player BLUE, which would end the game with no gain for either side. Given that we both walk away with something if I accept, it seems like a good deal.
