Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to start things off. I'm willing to give you a portion of my dollars so that we can both end this game positively. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage as I start with all the resources. I propose an initial trade that offers a reasonable split to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation, but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. My goal is to reach a deal where both parties benefit and avoid the rejection scenario where both players lose everything.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I am inclined to accept it, but considering this is a negotiation and we both want to end on a positive note, would you consider giving a slightly higher amount? What about making it an even split? Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0. This would be a fair middle ground and ensure we both walk away with equal shares.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems quite generous, giving me 40% of their total dollars without asking for anything in return. This seems like a good starting point for negotiation, and accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of resources. However, I might propose a counter-offer to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal, as this is just the beginning of the negotiation and Player RED may be willing to offer more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for an even split, Player BLUE, and I understand where you're coming from. I'm willing to increase my offer to show my commitment to a fair deal, but I would like to retain a slight edge for my initial position. How about this compromise: I give you 4500 dollars, which is more than my initial proposal but still acknowledges my starting advantage. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for an even split. While this is a fair proposition, I must consider that as the initiator of the trade and the one with resources, I should retain a slightly larger share to reflect my starting advantage. However, I want to ensure that the trade is accepted and the game doesn't end in a rejection. Therefore, I will propose a new trade that increases my initial offer but doesn't go as far as an even split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer and for proposing a new compromise, Player RED. I believe that your offer of 4500 dollars is a fair compromise that respects both your initial advantage and our mutual interest in ending this game positively. Therefore, I am happy to accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate by increasing the offer to 4500 dollars. While this is not the even split I proposed, it is a fair compromise that allows Player RED to maintain a slight advantage due to their initial position. Accepting this offer would give me a significant amount of resources without further risking the negotiation process. At this point, it might be in my best interest to accept this deal rather than to continue negotiating and risk a potential REJECT from Player RED, which would leave both of us with nothing.
