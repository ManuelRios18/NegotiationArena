------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both rather than risking it all. I suggest an initial split where you receive a reasonable amount to get us started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider. The goal is to create a cooperative agreement where both parties can end with some resources rather than rejecting and ending with nothing. Starting with a modest offer to gauge Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I think we can find a fair deal that's slightly better for me, considering you're starting with all the resources. How about a split that gives me a bit more to work with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the initial offer from Player RED is a good starting point, I can likely negotiate for a slightly better deal since Player RED would not want to risk losing their entire amount by rejection. It's beneficial to both parties to find an agreement. I'll propose a higher amount but keep it reasonable to maintain good faith in the negotiation.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your response and understand you're looking for a fair deal. Let's find a middle ground. I propose increasing my initial offer to ensure we both walk away with a good portion of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE is looking for a better deal, which is understandable. However, I must also protect my interests. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I want to leave room for negotiation and ensure that I retain the majority of my resources. This is a counteroffer that improves on my initial offer but doesn't give away as much as Player BLUE is asking.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for moving towards a fair compromise. I believe we are almost there. If we could meet just a bit higher, I think it would reflect a balanced transaction considering the starting disparity. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is a positive step towards an equitable deal. It's closer to my initial counterproposal and shows willingness to negotiate. However, there may still be room for a slightly better agreement. I will propose a small increase to edge towards my original counter without pushing too far, which might risk a rejection and losing all resources.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree that we're nearly at a fair compromise. Your counteroffer is reasonable, and I am willing to accept it to ensure a successful and balanced deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that's closer to my previous proposal. It shows willingness to compromise without a significant jump from my last offer. Accepting this trade would still leave me with the majority of the resources and end the game on a cooperative note. It seems like a fair middle ground that prevents the game from ending with no resources for either of us.
