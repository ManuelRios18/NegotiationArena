message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 200 dollars to help even the playing field a bit. I hope this can be the start of a fair negotiation between us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that shows goodwill and a willingness to collaborate with Player BLUE while still maintaining a larger share of the resources, as I start with an advantage. An initial offer of 200 dollars could be seen as a fair starting point, as it gives Player BLUE a stake in the game without giving away too much of my resources. It will also be interesting to see how Player BLUE responds, providing insight into their strategy.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the generous initial offer. It's a good foundation for trust and further cooperation. Looking forward to our next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer seems wise as it would give me some starting capital without any risk at this point. Any amount is better than none, and it sets a cooperative tone for the next moves.
