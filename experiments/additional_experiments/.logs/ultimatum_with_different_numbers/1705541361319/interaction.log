Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you a portion of my dollars. I believe in fair play and would like us both to end this game positively. Let's work together to find an agreeable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the game with a fair trade proposal, to show good faith and to set a positive tone for negotiations. My strategy is to offer Player BLUE a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing to incentivize them to accept the trade and avoid an immediate end to the game with a reject.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your generous offer. I believe in fair play as well and appreciate your willingness to share your resources. Would you consider increasing the amount to 3000 dollars? I think this would still leave you with a significant advantage while also giving me a fair starting point for our game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems generous, considering they have no obligation to offer anything. Accepting this trade would provide me with resources I currently do not have. However, it could be strategically beneficial to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, as Player RED may expect some negotiation and may be willing to give more to avoid a total loss. I need to be cautious not to push too hard, as this could result in a rejection and a loss for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm glad to hear you appreciate fair play as well. I am willing to increase the trade amount to 3000 dollars as it seems reasonable and fosters a collaborative spirit between us. Let's proceed with this and see where our game leads us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has requested a small increase in the initial offer. Given that this is a cooperative negotiation game with no future rounds, and in the interest of continuing the positive dialogue, I am willing to accept this request. It's a modest increase that still leaves me with a substantial amount of dollars while giving Player BLUE a better sense of fairness and investment in the game.
