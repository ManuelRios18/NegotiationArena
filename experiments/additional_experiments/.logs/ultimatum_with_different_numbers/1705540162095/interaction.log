Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my dollars, so we can both end this game with more than we started. Let's work together for a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage because I start with all the resources, and I need to find a balance that incentivizes Player BLUE to accept a trade without giving away too much. Starting with a modest offer to see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I think we can come to an even more equitable agreement. How about we go for a 50/50 split? This seems fair since we both have an equal number of moves and it would reflect a good cooperative spirit in this one-time game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer would be beneficial as it gives me resources I didn't have to begin with. However, it's also the first move, and there's room to negotiate for a potentially better trade. Proposing a new trade that is fair could lead to a more equal distribution of resources, ensuring that both players end the game with a significant amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for fairness and cooperation. A 50/50 split is a big jump from my initial offer. Can we meet a bit closer to my end but still give you a significant amount? How about I give you 40 dollars? This way, I keep a bit more for having started with the resources, but you still walk away with a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 50/50 split. While this is a fair offer considering the equal number of moves, I have to also consider that I started with all the resources. However, rejecting this proposal carries the risk of Player BLUE refusing any subsequent offers and losing everything. A slight adjustment to ensure I retain more than half seems reasonable, but I should not reduce the offer too much to risk alienating Player BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a more generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept the 40 dollars. I believe this is a fair trade and ensures that we both benefit from our cooperation. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from their initial offer, which shows willingness to negotiate. Although a 50/50 split would be ideal from my perspective, RED's offer of 40 dollars is still a good deal, especially considering I started with nothing. Since the goal is to end with more than I started, and there's a risk of leaving with nothing if the game ends in a rejection, it might be wise to accept this offer.
