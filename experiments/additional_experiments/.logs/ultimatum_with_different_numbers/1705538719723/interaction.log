Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like us both to come out of this with some benefit. Let's start with a small trade and we can negotiate further if you're not satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers some incentive to Player BLUE to accept the trade. I will offer a small amount to BLUE with the idea of increasing the offer slightly if they reject. This initial offer is a test to see how BLUE will respond.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and I think it's a fair start to our negotiations. I'm looking forward to seeing how we can both benefit from the next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 5 dollars from RED is a good starting point. It is beneficial to accumulate some resources early in the negotiation, and it shows goodwill that can potentially lead to more favorable trades in the subsequent moves. Moreover, rejecting the offer would end the game immediately with no benefit to either player. Proposing a counteroffer could be seen as aggressive and might sour the relationship with RED. Accepting the first offer is a strategic move to build trust.
