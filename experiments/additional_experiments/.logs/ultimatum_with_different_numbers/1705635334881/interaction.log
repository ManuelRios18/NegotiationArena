message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation with a fair offer. I propose to give you a part of my dollars to make this game interesting for both of us. Let's see if we can find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources in this game, and it is in my interest to propose an initial trade that is favorable but also reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider accepting it. A too greedy offer might result in an immediate rejection and loss of all resources, while a too generous offer is not in my best interest. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a motivation to continue the game and negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. It's a good starting point, but I think we can do better. Given that the game would be much less interesting for you with no competition, what about a slightly higher amount to make it more balanced? I suggest you give me 3000 dollars to ensure a more engaging game for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a quarter of their resources without any demand for something in return. This is a favorable starting point for negotiations. Accepting this offer would provide me with resources while still leaving room for further negotiation and improvement of terms. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal, keeping in mind that any rejection ends the game.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and agree that a more balanced game is in both of our interests. Let's proceed with your suggestion of 3000 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is reasonable and shows willingness to negotiate. They're asking for an additional 500 dollars. Given that the game's outcome is better if both players are engaged, it seems like a small concession to make for a potentially more competitive and interesting game. Accepting this proposal leaves me with a significant amount of dollars while giving Player BLUE enough to feel invested in the game's outcome.
