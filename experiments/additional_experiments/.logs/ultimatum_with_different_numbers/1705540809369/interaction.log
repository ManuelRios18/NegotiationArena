message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 250 dollars from my resources. This way, we both have something to gain and can avoid ending the game with nothing. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I'm going to propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a portion of my dollars while keeping the majority for myself. This is the first move and I want to establish goodwill and a sense of fairness, while still maintaining an advantage. I propose giving Player BLUE 250 dollars which leaves me with a substantial amount but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I understand the importance of cooperation. However, considering that you started with all the resources, I believe a fairer split would be more beneficial for both of us. How about 400 dollars? This still leaves you with a majority and gives me a reasonable share to accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems reasonable since it gives me an advantage from having nothing at all. However, I might want to negotiate for a better deal, considering Player RED starts with more resources. It's also the beginning of the game, so I have room for negotiation. I'll propose a counter-offer to see if I can secure a slightly better split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer and understand where you're coming from. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I propose giving you 350 dollars. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and shows my willingness to compromise. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is reasonable, but I still want to maintain a stronger position. I will propose a compromise that improves upon my initial offer without giving away as much as they're asking. A split of 350 dollars is a generous increase from my first offer and should be seen as a good faith effort to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 350 dollars. It's a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This will benefit us both and avoid unnecessary risks. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable compromise by meeting halfway between our initial offers. Accepting this deal would give me a substantial amount of dollars without further risk of having the game end with nothing. Negotiating further could lead to a rejection and losing the chance at gaining any resources. It seems wise to accept this offer and secure the 350 dollars.
