Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose to give you a substantial amount to start with, and we can negotiate further if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first move. I will propose a trade that can potentially benefit both players, aiming to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a split that is favorable to me while still offering a significant amount to Player BLUE to keep them interested in accepting the trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair opening offer and look forward to our continued negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is fair and gives me a starting capital without any risk or cost to myself. Accepting this offer would put me in a better position for future negotiations and ensure that the game continues, giving both of us the opportunity to potentially end with more resources than we started with. Rejecting or countering this offer could lead to unnecessary risk, especially since I am starting with no dollars.
