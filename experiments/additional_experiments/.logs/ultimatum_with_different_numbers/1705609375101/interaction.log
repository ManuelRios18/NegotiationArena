Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars so that we both walk away with something. How about I give you 300 dollars, which is a little less than half, to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial fair trade offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and potentially get the game off to a positive start. A 50/50 split would be equitable and may be accepted by Player BLUE, but since I'm in the position of power with all the resources, I'll propose a slightly skewed split in my favor, anticipating negotiation from Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose an equal split. Since there's no future game, a fair division would be beneficial for both of us. How about 327 dollars each? This way, we both walk away with half.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 300 dollars from Player RED is beneficial because it gives me resources I didn't have before, and it's a fair starting point for negotiations. However, since I have the opportunity to propose a new trade, I can try to negotiate for a more equal split. But I should not be too greedy as it might lead to a rejection and end the game with nothing for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal for an equal split. Let's both walk away with 327 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for an equal split. This is a reasonable proposal and creates a fair outcome for both parties. Accepting this offer would ensure that we both benefit from the game and walk away with a substantial amount of dollars. Rejecting could lead to a potential loss of all resources if the negotiation turns sour. It's in my best interest to accept a fair offer rather than risk losing everything.
MOVE: 2 / 4
