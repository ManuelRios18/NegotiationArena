message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose I give you 40,000,000 dollars, which is a substantial amount to start with. This leaves me with the majority but still provides you with significant resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the dollars and the leverage in this game. I want to open with a generous offer to build trust and encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. A 50-50 split is generally seen as fair in many negotiations, but since I'm in a position of power, I'll propose a slightly skewed split that still gives Player BLUE significant resources but keeps me in a favorable position.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 40,000,000 dollars. Let's proceed on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 40,000,000 dollars is generous considering I started with nothing. Since this trade would give me significant resources without any cost, it's in my best interest to accept. There's no advantage to rejecting or countering with a proposal that could be seen as less favorable, which might prompt Player RED to reject and end the game with no benefit to either of us.
