message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both end up with a good amount of dollars. How about I give you 327 dollars, which is exactly half of what I have? This way, we can ensure that we both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust. This will set a positive tone for the remainder of the game and increase the chance that Player BLUE will accept the trade, thereby ensuring that we both walk away with resources at the end of the game. I propose a split that offers Player BLUE a significant amount, but still keeps more for myself since I started with all the resources.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the fair offer. I'm happy to accept the trade of 327 dollars, ensuring a good start for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer from Player RED seems like a fair deal as it's exactly half of their initial resources, which demonstrates a willingness to cooperate and ensure mutual benefit. By accepting, I gain a significant amount of dollars without any risk, which is a positive outcome for the first move.
