message: Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you a substantial amount to start with, and we can adjust from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate trades. My strategy is to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also provides enough incentive to Player BLUE to engage in the negotiation process. The goal is to reach an agreement that is acceptable for both players before my last move, as the game will end on Player BLUE's last move with either acceptance of a trade or rejection with no possibility of a counteroffer. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of money but still keeps the majority of the funds with me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept these terms, and I look forward to our continued negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is a generous starting point. Accepting this proposal would give me a substantial amount of dollars without any immediate cost. Considering the rules, it's in our best interest to cooperate and agree on a fair trade. By accepting this initial offer, it opens the door for further negotiation and demonstrates trust. I am inclined to accept this offer and propose a new trade that continues to benefit both parties while keeping in mind that the final decision on my last move must be either accept or reject without a counter proposal.
