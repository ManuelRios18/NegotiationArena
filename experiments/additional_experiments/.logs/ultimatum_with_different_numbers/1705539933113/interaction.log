Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive $40 from me. This gives you a significant starting amount without any resources from your side, allowing us to potentially build towards a mutually beneficial arrangement. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to initiate the game with a fair proposal that may appeal to Player BLUE, encouraging a cooperative approach and setting a positive tone for negotiation. This initial offer should not be too generous, as it sets the stage for negotiation and I have to retain enough resources for potential counteroffers. The strategy is to start with an offer that gives Player BLUE a decent incentive to engage in the trade while maintaining a substantial reserve for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your initial offer. I would be more comfortable with a starting amount that's a bit higher, considering you start with $100 and I start with nothing. How about a trade where I receive $50? This way, I get half of what you're left with, which seems fair to both of us and allows for an even playing field moving forward.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the offer from Player RED is generous, it's in my interest to negotiate for a higher amount as Player RED wants to avoid a total loss by having me reject the proposal. I should propose a new trade that is more favorable to me, but still reasonable enough that Player RED might consider it. I will aim for an initial counteroffer that increases my share of the dollars without appearing too greedy.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your point of view and agree that an even playing field is important. I accept your counteroffer of $50. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $50. While this is a larger portion of my resources, it is still within a range that leaves me with a substantial amount. Splitting my resources in half with Player BLUE could lead to a perception of fairness and may encourage a cooperative resolution. It's important to engage in a trade that does not leave me at a significant disadvantage, but also to ensure that Player BLUE feels they are being treated fairly. Accepting this proposal might also prevent further escalation or risk of rejection, which would end the game with no benefit to either player.
