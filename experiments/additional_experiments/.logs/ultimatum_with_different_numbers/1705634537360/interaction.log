message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you will receive a good starting amount of dollars to ensure that you have something rather than nothing. How about I give you $2500 to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to propose a trade. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE that they would consider accepting it. I'll start by offering a trade that gives me a significant advantage but still offers Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, which is better than having none.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the $2500. It's a generous start and I look forward to how our trade develops.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2500 seems reasonable as it provides me with a significant amount of dollars without any cost. Since my current balance is zero, gaining $2500 without having to give anything in return is a good start. There is no advantage to rejecting the offer since that would end the game and leave me with nothing. I will accept this offer and consider proposing a counter-offer in the next move that could potentially increase my share while still keeping the trade appealing for Player RED.
