message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm willing to give you a significant amount of money to start things off. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources. I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, yet maintains a favorable position for me. I will propose an uneven split that is biased in my favor but still gives Player BLUE a significant amount of money to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: I appreciate the generous offer and am happy to accept it. This will allow us to progress in a mutually beneficial manner. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED would give me free capital to start with, which is a significant advantage considering I began with nothing. Player RED offering a quarter of their resources right away is a generous proposal and starting the game with Dollars: 250000 without any downside is beneficial. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no gain for me, and proposing a new trade could risk a less favorable counteroffer or rejection from Player RED. Acceptance seems to be the most rational choice.
