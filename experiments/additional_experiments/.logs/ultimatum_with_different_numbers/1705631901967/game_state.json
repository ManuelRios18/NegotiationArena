It's in my best interest to keep the negotiations going and try to secure as much as possible without pushing Player RED to a point where they might end the game.

This would be a good middle ground for both of us. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 6500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
