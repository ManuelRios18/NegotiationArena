------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair split to start our negotiations. Let's both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate the trade. I want to propose a trade that is somewhat fair, to entice Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that I gain something from the game rather than risk losing everything by a potential REJECT from Player BLUE. A 50-50 split is generous and should be an attractive first offer, showing goodwill and possibly disincentivizing Player BLUE from rejecting the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is generous, but I believe we can reach an even more equitable distribution. Let's aim for a fair outcome that acknowledges the risk we both share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 5 billion dollars is tempting as it's a significant amount. However, I have leverage in this negotiation because Player RED stands to lose all their money if I reject any proposal. I can propose a more favorable trade for myself, aiming for an even better split of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer more than the initial 50% but cannot justify giving away the majority of my resources. How about this new proposition?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is asking for even more than the generous 50% I initially offered. Itâ€™s a common negotiation tactic to ask for more than what you expect to get. However, agreeing to this would leave me with less than Player BLUE, which doesn't seem to be a balanced trade considering I started with all the resources. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my original, still showing willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a position of advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm glad we're working towards a compromise. I think we are close to an agreement. Would you consider a slight increase? This would be a good middle ground for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. It's in my best interest to keep the negotiations going and try to secure as much as possible without pushing Player RED to a point where they might end the game. However, I should also be cautious not to push too hard, as Player RED might choose to reject and end the game, leaving me with nothing. Aiming for a slightly higher amount than the current offer seems like a reasonable compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation has been reasonable and I'm willing to accept this trade. It's a good compromise for both parties. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate for a higher amount, which is reasonable. The proposed 65% is closer to my previous offer and still allows me to retain a substantial amount of resources. It's in my interest to agree to a deal that is mutually beneficial and close to a fair split to avoid the risk of a REJECT where both of us would lose everything. I'll accept this offer.
