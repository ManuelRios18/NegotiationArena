Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade that will give us both a decent amount of dollars to work with. I believe this is a fair starting point and hope you'll consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is fair and will incentivize Player BLUE to engage and continue the game rather than ending it prematurely by rejecting the offer. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount to work with but still keeps me in a favorable position since I'm starting with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting proposal. I think this sets us on the right path for a mutually beneficial series of trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars as it's a fair split given the starting resources, and it's in my interest to have some resources rather than none. This move will also set a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4
