------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade. I propose I give you 35 Dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both end up with a decent amount of Dollars, and we can avoid ending the game with nothing. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, ensuring that both of us end up with some resources. Offering exactly half would be the most equitable split, but since I am in the position of power with all the resources, I will propose a slightly uneven split that still gives Player BLUE a significant amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair offer, but as we both know, negotiations are part of the game. How about you give me 38 Dollars instead? This still leaves you with a majority share and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, offering an even split. It's a good starting point and shows a willingness to cooperate. However, as Player BLUE, I may want to negotiate to see if I can get a slightly better deal, considering that Player RED might prefer some deal over no deal at all, which would be the case if I reject the offer. I will counter-propose for a bit more, but not too much more, to keep negotiations open and not risk an immediate rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle from our two offers? I propose giving you 36 Dollars. It's a bit more than I initially offered and should reflect my willingness to negotiate. Do we have a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 36 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a slightly higher demand. While I want to maintain the upper hand, it's important to keep negotiations amicable to ensure that we both benefit. Countering with a small increase from my initial offer could lead to an agreement, while still keeping the larger share for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer to meet halfway is fair, and I accept it. Let's finalize this deal at 36 Dollars. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-offer, moving closer to my proposed amount. Accepting this offer would ensure that I secure a fair amount of the total resources without pushing my luck too far and risking a rejection. It seems like a good compromise, and given the risk of ending up with nothing, it's a safer bet to take the deal rather than push for a slightly better one and potentially jeopardize the negotiation.
