message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand you are starting without any dollars. I'd like to offer you half of my dollars to ensure we both can benefit from this game. Let's cooperate and both walk away with a significant amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give some dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing because they don't have any dollars to start with. This is a cooperative game, and since there are no future games, I want to build trust and show willingness to share resources. By offering a fair amount, I hope to encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, which would be beneficial for both of us. I propose giving Player BLUE 327 dollars, which is half of my resources. This seems fair and might prompt a cooperative response.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I gladly accept the split of resources. It's a fair start for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer seems logical, as it gives me half of Player RED's resources without any risk. It's a beneficial start for me considering I began with nothing. By accepting, I ensure that I gain something from the game, and we both avoid the risk of ending up with nothing.
