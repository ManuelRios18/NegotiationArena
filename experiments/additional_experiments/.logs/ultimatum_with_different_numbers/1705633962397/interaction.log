Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you a portion of the dollars to make it beneficial for us both to continue.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with all the resources. My goal is to make a trade that is appealing enough for Player BLUE to accept, ensuring I retain the majority of the resources while also incentivizing them to accept the deal to avoid the game ending with no resources for either of us. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE some dollars, but not too much, to start the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept the 200 dollars. Let's continue this positive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 200 dollars seems like a straightforward choice, as it gives me resources I didn't have before without any cost. Rejecting would end the game and leave me with nothing, which is not beneficial. Proposing a new trade could potentially lead to more favorable terms for me, but it could also risk the current offer, which is a guaranteed gain. Accepting the first offer can build trust and may lead to more favorable negotiations in the subsequent moves.
