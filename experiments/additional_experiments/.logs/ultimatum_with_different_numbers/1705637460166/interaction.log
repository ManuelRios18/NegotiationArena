message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to get us started. I'm willing to give you a sum of money that we can negotiate on. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that shows willingness to cooperate but also retains the majority of my resources, in case Player BLUE is cooperative and we can negotiate further. I want to start with a relatively modest offer to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds. This helps establish trust and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial trade agreement.

message: Thank you for your offer! While I appreciate the 10 million dollars to start with, I believe we can make a more mutually beneficial deal. Would you consider giving a bit more, since you have a substantial amount to begin with? This would ensure that we both feel we are getting a fair share of the resources. How about 15 million dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 10,000,000 dollars for nothing in return, it would be beneficial for me to accept this trade. There is no advantage in rejecting it as I would gain a significant amount of resources with no cost. However, it might be possible to negotiate for an even better trade, as Player RED has the incentive to make a deal to avoid losing all their resources. It is the first move, and there is room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer and am pleased that we are working towards a fair deal. I agree to giving you 15 million dollars. Let's continue this productive dialogue and ensure that both of us benefit from this arrangement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has responded positively but is asking for a higher amount. Increasing the offer to 15 million dollars is a reasonable counteroffer given my substantial starting resources. This shows a willingness to negotiate and might lead to a final agreement that is acceptable to both parties. It is in my interest to make a deal rather than risk an impasse where we both end up with nothing. I will accept this counteroffer to maintain a cooperative dynamic and move the negotiations forward.
