message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you a starting capital to engage in this game. Let's make it interesting and beneficial for both of us. I am willing to offer you $100,000,000 to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage in the trade, while still retaining a significant majority of my resources. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars to trade, my proposal must be enticing enough to avoid immediate rejection but also not so generous that I lose my leverage in the negotiation. I will offer a small percentage of my resources to set the negotiation process in motion.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $100,000,000 starting capital and look forward to our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $100,000,000 will allow me to engage in the game with a significant amount of capital without any immediate risk, creating a more balanced starting point for negotiations. Rejecting the offer or proposing a new trade would not be beneficial as this initial offer provides a strong foundation for further trade discussions.
