Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade to get things started. I propose giving you 10 dollars from my resources. This leaves me with a majority, but gives you a significant amount to consider. Let's have a fair game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources at the start, and I want to propose a trade that seems fair enough to be accepted by Player BLUE, but also leaves me with a significant portion of the resources. I will propose giving Player BLUE a smaller amount of dollars to start the negotiation, with the hopes of reaching an agreement before my final move.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I gladly accept your proposal. Looking forward to continuing the game in good spirits.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems reasonable since it provides me with some resources without any risk or cost. Rejecting would end the game immediately to my disadvantage, and proposing a new trade could potentially lead to a less favorable offer from Player RED. Accepting this initial trade sets a cooperative tone for the game.
