message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair deal. I propose giving you 13 dollars, so we both can walk away with something. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I will initiate a trade to see if Player BLUE is interested in cooperating for a mutually beneficial exchange. I will propose a fair split to start the negotiation process, offering Player BLUE 13 dollars for nothing in return, as they have no resources. This leaves me with a majority share but provides Player BLUE with a significant amount to consider accepting the deal.

Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair deal to me. Let's both walk away with something. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is fair, as it splits the resources evenly. Accepting the offer ensures a guaranteed gain of 13 dollars, which is better than the possibility of ending with nothing if either player rejects a proposal. This is a good starting trade, and it might be risky to negotiate for more, considering that Player RED has the initial advantage with resources.
