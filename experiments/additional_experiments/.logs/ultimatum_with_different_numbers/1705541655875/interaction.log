------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. How about I give you a starting capital to work with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me, but not so unfair that Player BLUE would immediately reject it. I will offer a small amount of dollars to open the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade proposal is beneficial as it gives me a starting capital without any immediate cost. The offer is generous and establishes a cooperative tone for the game. Rejecting or countering this early in the game could lead to a suboptimal outcome for both players. By accepting, I can potentially negotiate for more in the subsequent rounds.
