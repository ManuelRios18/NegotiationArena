message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you $20,000,000. This is a significant amount that can be beneficial for you. Let's make this trade and both walk away with plenty of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to propose the first trade. I will propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars to incentivize them to accept. I want to end the game with more resources than I give away. I will propose giving Player BLUE $20,000,000. This is a substantial amount that might be attractive to them, while still leaving me with the majority of the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer where you give me $30,000,000. Considering you have $100,000,000, I believe this is a fair increase that still leaves you with the majority of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade proposal from Player RED would provide me with a substantial amount of resources, which is a good starting point for negotiation. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a higher amount, keeping in mind that Player RED has much more to lose if I reject any proposal.

message: Player BLUE, your counteroffer of $30,000,000 is acceptable to me. Let's finalize this trade and both benefit from the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is higher than what I initially proposed, but it is still within a range that leaves me with a significant amount of resources. Considering the risk of the game ending with both players losing everything if a trade is rejected, and that Player BLUEâ€™s counteroffer is still reasonable, I am inclined to accept this offer. It ensures that I maintain the majority of the resources while also guaranteeing that Player BLUE gets a substantial amount without further negotiation risks.
