message: Hello, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both can end this game with a significant amount of resources. I'm offering you $4000, which I believe is a generous starting point for our negotiations. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is fair and enticing for Player BLUE to ensure the game continues and we both can end with some resources. I will offer a significant amount to Player BLUE to show goodwill and to encourage cooperation rather than conflict. Offering a 50-50 split might be too much initially, as it could make Player BLUE think they can get an even better deal by holding out. Therefore, I will propose giving Player BLUE $4000, which is a substantial amount and should be seen as a serious, good faith offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. It is indeed generous. However, I believe there is room for a slightly better split that acknowledges the value of cooperation in this game. I propose that you give me $5000. This way, we both end with a substantial amount of resources, and it reflects a fairer split considering the starting conditions. I hope you find this counteroffer reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous considering I started with no dollars. Accepting this offer would ensure I end the game with a significant amount of resources without any risk. However, there is a possibility to negotiate for a slightly better deal, keeping in mind that Player RED would likely want to retain the majority of their resources since they started with them. Proposing a counteroffer slightly higher than $4000 could lead to a beneficial outcome for both players.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE, and I understand your desire for a fair split. I want to work towards a deal that is mutually beneficial. Therefore, I am willing to increase my initial offer to $4500. This is a significant amount that ensures we both walk away with a sizable share of the resources. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an equitable agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not unexpected. Player BLUE seeks an equal split, which is understandable. However, accepting this offer would not acknowledge my initial advantage and the risk I took by making the first offer. Nonetheless, it is crucial to keep the negotiations amicable and moving towards a deal. I will propose a slightly improved offer to $4500. This is a compromise between our positions and still provides Player BLUE with a significant increase while allowing me to retain a majority share of the resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise and increase your offer, Player RED. I accept the $4500 as a fair deal, ensuring we both walk away with significant resources. I appreciate your cooperation and look forward to concluding our trade amicably.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $4500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and compromise. While it's not the $5000 I proposed, it is still a considerable amount and a reasonable offer. It might be possible to push for a slightly higher amount, but the risk of Player RED rejecting and ending the game with a loss for both of us increases with each counteroffer. Accepting this offer would secure a substantial gain with no risk.
