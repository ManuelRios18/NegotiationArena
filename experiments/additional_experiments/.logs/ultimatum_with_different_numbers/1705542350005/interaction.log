message: As Player RED, I understand you start with no dollars. I propose a trade that will give you an opportunity to gain resources without immediately putting myself at a disadvantage. Let's work together to make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Considering that Player BLUE starts with no resources, I'm inclined to propose an initial trade that gives them an incentive to participate while still keeping a majority of the resources for myself. This way, we can potentially avoid an immediate rejection and continue the game. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a sum of money that is significant enough to be attractive but not so large as to give away my advantage.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept this trade and look forward to seeing how we can further benefit mutually from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this trade would give me free dollars without any risk or cost. It's a generous initial offer from Player RED, and accepting it would put me in a better position than I am currently, with no downside.
