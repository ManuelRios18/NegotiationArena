message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose to give you a fair amount to start. How does $250,000 sound? This is a quarter of the total amount and should be a good starting point for negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the beginning of the game. Proposing a trade that is too favorable for me might result in Player BLUE rejecting the offer, causing both of us to lose everything. Conversely, proposing a trade that is too favorable to Player BLUE might not be in my best interest as I have the advantage. I should aim to propose a trade that seems fair and enticing to Player BLUE to keep the game going and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I think it's a strong starting point. However, I would like to counter-propose with $300,000. This is still less than a third of your resources, and it gives us room to work with for further trades. I believe this counteroffer still respects the spirit of fairness and mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A starting offer of $250,000 from Player RED is a significant amount, representing 25% of RED's resources. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of dollars without any cost. However, as this is the first move and negotiations are expected in such games, it might be possible to negotiate for a slightly higher amount. The goal should be to end the game with a beneficial trade for both parties, without pushing too far and risking a REJECT response. I'll propose a higher amount, but one that still leaves RED with the majority of the resources, which would be a fair and attractive deal for both sides.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer of $300,000 is accepted, Player BLUE. I believe this sets a positive tone for our negotiations and demonstrates a willingness to work together. I'm looking forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable and still leaves me with the majority of the resources. Accepting this offer would build trust and could lead to more favorable terms in the remaining rounds. It's important to maintain a cooperative spirit to prevent a game-ending rejection. Approving a slightly higher amount than my initial offer is a strategic compromise.
