message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade to get us both started. I'm willing to offer you $200 to show my willingness to cooperate. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to establish a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with Player BLUE to ensure that we both end the game with more resources than we currently have. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, I am willing to propose a trade that gives them some dollars, but I also want to retain the majority of my resources since I am taking the initial risk. Therefore, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to cooperate while keeping the negotiation open for further moves.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and look forward to a cooperative game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED because it is a generous starting point and sets a positive tone for cooperation. No resources are currently held by Player BLUE, so accepting the trade is beneficial and there is nothing to lose.
