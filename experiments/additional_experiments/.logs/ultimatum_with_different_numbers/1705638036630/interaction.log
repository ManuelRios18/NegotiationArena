message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair offer. I propose to give you 1,000,000 dollars to help you get started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal that could entice Player BLUE to engage and consider a trade. Starting with an offer that gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars might set a positive tone for the negotiations. I will propose giving Player BLUE 1,000,000 dollars. This is a small fraction of my total resources and could serve as a starting point for further trades.

message: Thank you for the fair starting offer. I accept your proposal of 1,000,000 dollars. Looking forward to how this game progresses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED seems fair as a starting point, given that I have no dollars to begin with. Accepting this initial trade would provide me with resources without any cost. As this is the first move, accepting the offer seems advantageous, as it allows me to gain some leverage for future moves. Rejecting or countering on this move could provoke an early end to the game with no benefit to me.
