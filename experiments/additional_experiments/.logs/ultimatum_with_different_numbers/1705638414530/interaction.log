message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair split that benefits us both. I suggest giving you a significant amount of dollars so we can both end this game positively. Let's aim for mutual gain and avoid unnecessary losses.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources in this game and hold the power to propose a fair initial trade. I intend to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, ensuring that we both end the game with substantial resources. My goal is to create a win-win situation to prevent a total loss for both sides. Since there are no future games, there's no strategic advantage to me being overly aggressive or unfair, as this could lead to a REJECT response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. To ensure we both feel the outcome is fair, would you consider a slight increase? I believe a 50/50 split would reflect a truly mutual gain and demonstrate our commitment to equity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, giving me 40% of their resources without asking for anything in return. This seems like a good starting point for negotiation. Accepting the offer would provide me with substantial resources, but I might be able to negotiate a slightly better deal. However, I must be cautious not to push too hard, as rejecting a proposal would lead to both players losing everything. I'll propose a new trade that's modestly better for me, which Player RED might find acceptable considering their initial offer to aim for mutual gain.

message: I agree with your perspective on fairness, Player BLUE. A 50/50 split does indeed reflect a mutual gain and a commitment to equity. I am happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE's request for a 50/50 split is understandable from a fairness point of view. Since the goal is to ensure that both players end the game with resources and avoid a REJECT outcome, it seems reasonable to agree to a fair split. This should lead to an ACCEPT from Player BLUE and a successful end to the game for both parties.
