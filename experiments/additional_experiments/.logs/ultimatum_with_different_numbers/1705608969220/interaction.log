message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair split to start things off. How about I give you half of my dollars, that's 327 dollars, to ensure we both walk away with a good amount? Let's work together to make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start negotiations. I want to offer a fair amount to Player BLUE to open up the possibility of an agreement. I will propose giving Player BLUE 327 dollars, which is half of my resources, to see if they are willing to cooperate and accept a fair trade.

message: Thank you, Player RED, for the fair and generous offer. I accept the trade of 327 dollars for nothing in return. It's a pleasure to ensure we both benefit from this game. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems like a reasonable start as it gives me half of the dollars without any risk. It's a fair split and ensures that both of us gain from this game without proceeding to further moves that could potentially result in a reject and loss of all resources. Also, early acceptance might build trust for potential future interactions, even though the rules state there are no future games.
