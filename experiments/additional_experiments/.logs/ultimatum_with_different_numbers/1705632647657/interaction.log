Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly so we both can benefit. I believe a fair trade is the best way to ensure we both walk away with something rather than risk losing everything. What are your thoughts?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources at the start of the game. In order to encourage cooperation and a fair trade, I will propose a split that offers Player BLUE some dollars. This can be seen as an incentive for BLUE to engage in the game rather than instantly rejecting and ending the game with no benefit for either side. I will propose a 50-50 split which is often seen as a fair starting point in negotiation scenarios.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal, RED. An even split is a fair way to ensure we both benefit. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Splitting the resources evenly seems like a fair starting proposal. Accepting this trade would give me resources I didn't have before and guarantees that I walk away with something rather than nothing. Rejecting or counter-proposing runs the risk of ending up with no resources if RED decides to end the game. I choose to accept the offer.
