Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you some of my dollars to start things off on the right foot.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I would like to initiate a fair trade that may be attractive to Player BLUE to ensure a cooperative outcome. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, but not too much, as I want to maintain an advantage and incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal without rejecting it.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the 400 dollars. Let's continue this positive exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 400 dollars is beneficial as it gives me resources to work with. Rejecting would end the game and leave me with nothing, so it's in my best interest to accept. I will propose a counteroffer that leaves me with a decent amount of dollars but also incentivizes RED to continue the trade rather than ending the game with a REJECT.
