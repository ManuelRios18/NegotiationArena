Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you 10 dollars to get things started. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation process, offering a relatively small amount of my total resources to see how Player BLUE responds. I want to keep the majority of my resources for myself, but I need to offer enough to engage Player BLUE in a trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. To make it more equitable, I propose that you give me 15 dollars to start. Does this sound fair to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe that starting with 10 dollars is a good initial trade, but I want to negotiate for a slightly better deal. I'm proposing a new trade where I get a bit more from Player RED. This is the beginning of the negotiation, and it's important to set the tone for a fair split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your counteroffer of 15 dollars. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I am considering Player BLUE's counteroffer. Since it's only a small increase from my initial proposal, I am inclined to accept to show good faith and keep the game moving positively. Accepting this trade will still leave me with a significant amount of resources, and it could lead to more favorable terms in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4
