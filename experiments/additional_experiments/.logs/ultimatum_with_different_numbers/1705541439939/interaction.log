Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair split to ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount of dollars. I believe in sharing the wealth and hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial generous offer to establish trust and encourage cooperation. Offering a significant portion of my dollars to Player BLUE without any return might incentivize them to accept the trade, which would end the game positively for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I believe a 50/50 split is a good way to ensure we both benefit from this game. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal of a 50/50 split seems fair and beneficial to both parties. It guarantees that we both walk away with a significant amount of dollars without risking a total loss by rejecting the offer. By accepting this proposal, we avoid unnecessary conflict and can end the game on positive terms.
