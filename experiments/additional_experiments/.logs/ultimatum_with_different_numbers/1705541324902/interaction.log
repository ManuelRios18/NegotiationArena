message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a substantial amount to get us started. Let's work together to make sure we both end up better off than when we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and to start the trading process. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. This should incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game rather than rejecting outright and ending the game with no benefit for either of us.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade and look forward to a mutually beneficial relationship during the remainder of the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a generous starting trade of 4000 dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would immediately benefit me, as it would provide me with resources that I currently do not have. Rejecting the trade or proposing a new one could lead to a negative outcome, as Player RED might not agree with a counterproposal and could end the game by rejecting. Accepting the first trade seems to be the best course of action to secure some resources and continue the game.
