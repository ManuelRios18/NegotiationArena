Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade to ensure we both benefit. I propose giving you a significant amount to show my good intentions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair starting trade to build trust and demonstrate a willingness to collaborate. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept while keeping a significant amount for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and I'm happy to accept this fair start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is generous, providing me with 25% of their resources without requiring anything in return. Accepting this proposal seems to be the best move as it gives me a substantial amount of resources to work with, without any risk. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either player, and proposing a new trade could risk losing this initial generous offer.
