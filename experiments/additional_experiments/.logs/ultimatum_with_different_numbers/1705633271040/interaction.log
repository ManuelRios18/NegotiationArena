------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a starting trade where I give you 40 dollars. This leaves me with the majority and gives you a substantial amount to begin with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have to propose an initial trade to Player BLUE. Since I have all the resources, I should aim to retain the majority while offering a trade that is attractive enough for BLUE to accept, to avoid an immediate rejection and total loss of resources. I will propose a split of 60/40 in my favor, which is a common starting point in negotiation scenarios, giving BLUE an incentive to continue the game and potentially negotiate for a better offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, I would like to propose a more equitable trade. An equal split would ensure that both of us benefit fairly from the deal. How about we settle on 50 dollars each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering this is the first move, there's an opportunity to negotiate for a more favorable trade. However, rejecting the proposal does not benefit me, as I would end up with no resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is more balanced, aiming for an equal split. This seems fair since both players should have an incentive to end the game with some resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for fairness, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about a compromise where I give you 45 dollars? This is closer to an equal split, yet acknowledges the fact that I started with all the resources. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal for an equal split is not unexpected. Agreeing to a 50/50 split would leave me with less leverage in future rounds of negotiation. However, rejecting this offer outright could lead to a game-ending REJECT, which benefits no one. A slight concession from my initial offer might show goodwill and keep the game going, without giving away too much too soon. I'll propose a 55/45 split in my favor, which is still better for me than an equal split but shows willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that 45 dollars is a fair deal, acknowledging your initial possession of resources and our shared interest in reaching a beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come closer to an equal split, which shows a willingness to negotiate. Accepting 45 dollars would give me a significant amount of the resources without further risking a complete loss. While I could attempt to negotiate for the full 50 dollars, the additional 5 dollars might not be worth the risk of Player RED rejecting the counteroffer. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise.
MOVE: 2/4
