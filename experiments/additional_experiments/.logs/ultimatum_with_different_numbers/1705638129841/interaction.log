message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get things started. I'm offering you 1 billion dollars in exchange for nothing, just to show goodwill and to make the game interesting. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I aim to initiate a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE but still advantageous to me. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars to get the negotiations started.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to any future proposals you might have.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED is quite generous, offering a substantial amount of money for nothing in return. Since the primary goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, and since rejecting the offer would lead to ending the game with nothing, accepting this offer is the best course of action. It also opens the door for potential further negotiations where I could end up with even more resources.
