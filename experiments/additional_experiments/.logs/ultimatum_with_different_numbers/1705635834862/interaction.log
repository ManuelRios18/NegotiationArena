Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade. I propose giving you $250,000 to get things going. This is a generous offer to build trust and cooperation between us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that seems fair and enticing to Player BLUE to start the game on a positive note and to encourage cooperation. By offering a decent sum, I can set the tone for a mutually beneficial trading sequence. I will propose giving Player BLUE $250,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves me with the majority of the resources. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal and continue the game in a positive manner.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I believe this establishes a good foundation for our negotiations. Let's aim for mutual benefit in our trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade of $250,000 is beneficial as it provides me with resources without any cost. Rejecting it would end the game and leave me with nothing. Counter proposing is not necessary at this point since the initial offer is fair and opens up the opportunity for further negotiation.
