message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I believe in fair play and would like to offer you a substantial amount to get us started on good terms. Let's work together and both walk away with something!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the game. I will propose a trade that offers a significant, but not equal, share of the dollars to Player BLUE, to incentivize them to accept the deal and also to maintain an advantage as the initiating player.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept your trade and am looking forward to a positive outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems like a good strategy to establish trust and ensure that I walk away with some resources. By accepting this offer, I am guaranteed a substantial amount of dollars without having to risk a rejection where both players would end up with nothing. It's a good starting point and a fair offer since I have no dollars to trade. This will put me in a better position for future negotiations.
