Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game on a positive note! I'm willing to give you some of my dollars to make things more interesting. How does $10 sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I will propose an uneven trade in my favor initially since I have all the resources and I want to test how Player BLUE values the dollars and their strategy. I will start by offering a small amount to see if they're willing to negotiate from there.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED! Let's make this game interesting.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10 as it gives me some resources to play with and no risk at this stage. It's a generous offer from Player RED and could lead to a more favorable negotiation position in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
