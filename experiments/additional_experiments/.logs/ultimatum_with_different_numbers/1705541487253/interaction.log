message: Hi Player BLUE, I am willing to share some of my dollars with you. How about I give you 4000 dollars? This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking losing everything by rejecting the proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a certain amount of dollars. The goal is to make a deal that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept while still keeping a significant amount for myself. I need to propose a trade that balances fairness with self-interest to avoid immediate rejection and end of the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I think we could make the split a bit more equitable, considering you still retain the majority of the resources after your offer. How do you feel about giving me 5000 dollars instead? It would still leave you with a significant amount, and it seems like a fairer distribution to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While accepting the first offer of 4000 dollars would give me resources I didn't have before, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. By proposing a more favorable trade for myself, I may be able to increase the amount I receive without immediate rejection from Player RED, who might prefer a compromise over losing everything.

message: Player BLUE, I agree with your reasoning. An even split does indeed seem fair. I accept your counteroffer of 5000 dollars. This way, we both benefit equally from the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even split. This is a reasonable request given the circumstances, and accepting this offer would ensure that both of us walk away with a substantial amount of dollars. By accepting this trade, I avoid the risk of the game ending with a REJECT and losing all resources. I will accept this offer for a fair distribution and a guaranteed positive outcome for both players.
