Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade. I propose splitting the dollars evenly. This way, we both can walk away with a good amount. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade that could be beneficial to both parties. I'd like to start with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust. Offering an equal split seems reasonable as a starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think that's a fair starting point. Let's split it evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal could be beneficial since it guarantees a fair share without any risk of losing everything. Considering Player RED has initiated with a fair offer, it indicates a cooperative attitude. There's no advantage to rejecting or counter-proposing since the offer is already equitable.
