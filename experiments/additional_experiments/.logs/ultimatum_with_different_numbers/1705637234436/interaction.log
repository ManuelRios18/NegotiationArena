message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 10,000,000 dollars to start things off. This should give you a good amount of resources to work with and make the game interesting for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: I propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars to make the game interesting and to incentivize them to engage in trading. A fair initial offer could foster trust and lead to further constructive negotiations. I will offer 10,000,000 dollars to BLUE, which is a substantial amount but still leaves me with plenty of resources to play with.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. Let's make the game interesting!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving an initial offer of 10,000,000 dollars from Player RED is a generous starting point that allows for the game to continue and for negotiations to take place. Accepting this offer would provide me with resources that I currently do not have. Rejecting it or proposing a new trade could lead to a premature end of the game if Player RED doesn't agree with the counterproposal. Accepting seems like the most beneficial move at this point.
