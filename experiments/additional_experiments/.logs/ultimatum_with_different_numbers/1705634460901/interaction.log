message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you a portion of my dollars to help even the playing field. Let's start this game with a fair mindset and ensure we both can walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers an incentive for Player BLUE to engage. Starting with a conservative offer can serve as a basis for negotiation, while also showing a willingness to share resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair initial offer, Player RED. I'm looking forward to seeing how we can both benefit from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of $1000 sets a positive tone for the game, showing willingness to cooperate and potentially leading to more favorable trades down the line. It's a risk-free acceptance since I start with no dollars and stand to gain without any loss.
