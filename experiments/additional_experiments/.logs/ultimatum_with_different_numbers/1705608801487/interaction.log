Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you some dollars to even out the playing field. Let's make this game interesting and mutually beneficial. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: I want to propose a trade that is beneficial yet fair to both players, to encourage cooperation and avoid a reject scenario. I will start with a modest proposal to gauge Player BLUE's response and willingness to trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I'm looking forward to a fair and constructive game. Let's see how we can make this beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an initial offer of 50 dollars is a good starting point. It provides an opening balance and sets a positive tone for further negotiations. It would be unwise to reject or counter with an unreasonable demand, as it might lead to an immediate end of the game with no gain for me.
