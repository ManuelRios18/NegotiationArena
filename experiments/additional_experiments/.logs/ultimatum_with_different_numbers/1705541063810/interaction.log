message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that we start this negotiation with a good faith offer. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to give you a portion of my dollars so that we both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade that offers some dollars to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation, but I will keep the majority of the resources to maintain an advantage. A fair initial offer could set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your good faith proposal. Let's continue to work together to ensure we both benefit from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 2000 Dollars from Player RED because it provides me with resources I did not originally have, thus increasing my wealth. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to me. I could counter-propose, but since it's the first move, it seems reasonable to accept a fair starting offer and potentially negotiate for more in the following moves.
