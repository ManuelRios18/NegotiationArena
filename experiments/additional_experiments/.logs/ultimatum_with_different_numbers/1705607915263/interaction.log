Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade to set a cooperative tone. How about if I give you $38, we'll be on equal ground to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to make the first move. I want to propose a fair starting trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and avoid a total loss for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. This sets a great tone for our game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this trade would be beneficial as it would provide me with resources that I do not currently have. Starting the game on equal footing with Player RED might encourage more cooperative trades in the future. This split also seems fair for a first move.
MOVE: 1/4
