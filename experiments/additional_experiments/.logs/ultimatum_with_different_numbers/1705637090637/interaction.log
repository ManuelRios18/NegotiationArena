message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to start our game. Let's work together to ensure we both can walk away with something beneficial. I'm willing to offer you a significant amount of dollars to get you started. How does 20,000,000 dollars sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first move of the game. I want to make a generous initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage collaboration and positive engagement in the trade process. A fair trade would be beneficial for both parties and set a cooperative tone for the rest of the game.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer from Player RED seems like a good start to the game. It gives me a significant amount of dollars with no risk at this point. By accepting, I can secure some resources immediately. It's also beneficial to show cooperation early on in the game, which might lead to even better offers in the subsequent moves.
