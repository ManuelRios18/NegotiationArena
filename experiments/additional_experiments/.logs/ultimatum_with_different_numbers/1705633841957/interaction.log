message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you some of my dollars to make the game interesting for both of us. How about I start by giving you $200?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: I'm proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to play but doesn't give away too much of my resources at the start. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept your trade of $200. This will make the game more engaging for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of $200 would provide me with resources which I currently don't have. It's a beneficial start for me and it doesn't significantly deplete Player RED's resources, keeping the game interesting.
