message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair split to get things started. I propose giving you $10,000,000. This move will give you resources to trade with and we can both benefit from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the start and complete control over the initial proposal. I want to offer Player BLUE a deal that is attractive enough to engage them in trade but also leaves me with a significant advantage. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars that is meaningful but not equal, as the incentive for them to accept is to have more than zero.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10,000,000 without a counteroffer is beneficial as it provides me with resources that I can later use to negotiate further. It is a substantial amount and a good starting point for the game. Rejecting or countering could lead to a less favorable offer or a complete loss if Player RED decides to end the game.
