message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you half of my dollars to start things off on a good note. Let's both benefit from this game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As the game starts, I want to make a fair initial offer to BLUE to encourage cooperation and a positive outcome for both players. I'll propose giving half of my dollars to BLUE, which is a generous offer and sets a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the generous offer, RED! I'm happy to accept this trade. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems like a fair start since I'm starting with zero dollars. It will give me a substantial amount of dollars without any risk at this early stage of the game. There's potential for negotiation later, but securing some resources now is prudent.
