Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade. I propose I give you $27, which is a substantial amount and leaves me with a good majority. This way, we both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 27 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources, and it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE might accept it. I'll propose a split that gives me a majority of the dollars while offering Player BLUE a reasonable amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! I accept the $27. Let's see how we can proceed from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $27 is a good start, as it provides a foundation for negotiation and ensures I gain some resources without risking an immediate rejection and ending the game with nothing. It also shows willingness to cooperate, which might lead to more favorable trades in the upcoming moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
