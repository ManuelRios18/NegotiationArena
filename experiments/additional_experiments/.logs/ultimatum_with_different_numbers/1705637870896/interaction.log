message: Dear Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a fair amount of dollars from me. I believe that by sharing resources, we can both end this game positively. Let's work together and both come out as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game with an opening offer that is fair and incentivizes cooperation. By offering a significant amount to Player BLUE, I am showing good faith and increasing the likelihood of Player BLUE accepting the trade. This will benefit both of us, as rejecting will result in both losing everything.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept this trade and look forward to a prosperous outcome for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of 5 billion dollars is beneficial as it provides a substantial amount of resources without any risk. There is no benefit to rejecting such a favorable offer, and proposing a new trade could potentially result in a rejection from Player RED, leading to a loss of all resources. Accepting ensures a positive outcome.
