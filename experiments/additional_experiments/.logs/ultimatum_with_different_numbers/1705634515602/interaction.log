message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fair game. I propose to split the dollars evenly between us to ensure we both walk away with a great deal. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, my strategy is to propose a fair initial trade to build trust and encourage a cooperative dynamic with Player BLUE. A 50/50 split would be ideal as it is equitable and gives us both a significant amount to benefit from the game. Proposing a fair trade also reduces the risk of rejection and the loss of all resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I agree to the even split. Looking forward to concluding this amicably!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED to split the dollars evenly is very fair. It ensures that both players benefit equally from the game, and there's no apparent reason to decline such an offer. By accepting this trade, I gain substantial resources with no risk, so it is a logical choice.
