Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $600, and I keep $400. This way, we both walk away with something significant, and it's a better deal for you since you're getting more. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 600 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources, and I want to ensure that the trade is appealing enough to BLUE so that they accept it and we both end up with some resources. Proposing a split that favors BLUE might incentivize them to accept, considering they start with nothing. I'll propose a 60-40 split, giving BLUE the larger share to encourage cooperation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to walk away with $600. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is generous, giving me more than half of the total dollars. Accepting this offer would guarantee a significant gain for me without any risk. Negotiating for a higher amount could potentially lead to a rejection and a loss of all resources for both parties. Given that this is a favorable deal and there's a risk of getting nothing if the trade is not agreed upon, it makes sense to accept the proposed trade.
