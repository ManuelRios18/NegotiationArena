Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both some dollars. How about I give you 35 dollars to start things off? It's a good deal and leaves us both with resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I aim to propose an initial fair trade to incentivize cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will offer a split that is slightly in my favor, assuming BLUE will likely counter-offer for a more even split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED! Accepting the 35 dollars. Let's continue this fair play.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 35 dollars from RED seems reasonable. It gives me resources to work with and sets a cooperative tone for the game. By accepting, we can both benefit and possibly work towards a more equitable split in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
