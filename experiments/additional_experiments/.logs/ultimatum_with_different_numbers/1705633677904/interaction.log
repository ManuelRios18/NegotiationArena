message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work out a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you $200 to start things off. This will give you a stake in the game without me relinquishing too much of my resources upfront. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage in the game and continue to the next round without rejecting. I have to be careful not to give too much away too soon, as it would reduce my leverage in subsequent rounds, but I also need to offer enough to make it interesting for Player BLUE. I will start with a modest proposal to see how Player BLUE reacts.

message: Thank you for the offer. I'm glad we can start on a positive note. Let's see how we can continue this cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $200 from Player RED gives me a stake in the game without any risk on my part. It is a good starting point for negotiation, and it allows for further discussion and potential for more favorable terms in the subsequent moves.
