message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive 10 Dollars from me. This way, we both walk away with something. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As the game starts, I want to propose a trade that's beneficial to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. If I offer a split that's too skewed in my favor, Player BLUE might reject it, causing both of us to lose everything. I'll propose giving 10 Dollars to Player BLUE for 0, which leaves me with a majority and gives Player BLUE a significant amount to consider. It's an opening offer and can be negotiated.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would feel more comfortable with a slightly better split given that you have 27 Dollars to begin with. How about you give me 13 Dollars? This way, we are closer to an even split, and we both walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 10 dollars is a reasonable start since it gives me resources without any on my part. It's in my best interest to accept some form of trade to ensure I don't end the game with nothing. However, I can negotiate for a better deal because Player RED might be motivated to avoid a total loss as well. I propose a counteroffer to see if I can increase my share.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: I accept your proposal, Player BLUE. Let's split the dollars as you suggested. It seems like a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable considering they started with no dollars. A trade of 13 Dollars would leave me with 14, still more than Player BLUE, and would ensure that we both walk away with a fair amount of the resources. I think it's a good idea to accept this trade to avoid the risk of a rejection and both of us ending with nothing.
