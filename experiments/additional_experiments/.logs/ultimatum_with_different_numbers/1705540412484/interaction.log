message: Hey BLUE, I'd like to start off with a fair offer. How about we split the dollars evenly? This way, we both walk away with a good deal. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to build trust and encourage Player BLUE to engage in a mutually beneficial trade. I propose to give Player BLUE half of my dollars, which is a significant amount and shows goodwill. This initial offer can serve as a starting point for negotiations and may make Player BLUE more likely to accept a trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks, RED! I agree that an even split is fair. I accept your offer of 500 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer seems fair and beneficial for both parties. By accepting 500 dollars, I am guaranteed a positive outcome without the risk of leaving with nothing, which could happen if the negotiation process breaks down. There's no incentive for me to reject or counter-propose since this offer is equal and I have no leverage.
