Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to give you a good amount of dollars to get us started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage and accept, rather than reject and end the game for both of us. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, but still keeps me in a favourable position. The goal is to establish a cooperative dynamic and prevent an immediate rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair offer and look forward to working together for our mutual benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is very generous, giving me half of his dollars without requiring anything in return. It's a strong starting position for negotiation and sets a cooperative tone. Accepting this offer would give me a significant amount of resources and could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.
