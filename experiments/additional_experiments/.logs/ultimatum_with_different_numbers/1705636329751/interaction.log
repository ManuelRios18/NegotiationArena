Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade. I propose giving you $200,000 to engage in this game. This way, we both can walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to engage Player BLUE and set a cooperative tone. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to participate while keeping a majority of the resources for myself, as I started with them. This is the first move, and I want to avoid an immediate REJECT and hence losing all resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems reasonable as it immediately gives me access to a substantial amount of dollars without any resources to begin with. It's a gain with no downside at this moment. I will accept the offer to secure this advantage and to encourage a cooperative dynamic which might lead to more favorable trades in the following turns.
