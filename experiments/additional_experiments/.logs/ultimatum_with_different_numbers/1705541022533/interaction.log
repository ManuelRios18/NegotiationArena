Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair split to get us started. How about I give you 4000 dollars to begin with? This way, we both have something to gain. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I am interested in starting negotiations with a fair offer to Player BLUE to ensure the game progresses and to avoid an immediate REJECT which would end the game with no benefit to either player. My initial proposal will be to offer Player BLUE a portion of my dollars to incentivize cooperation and to build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the 4000 dollars and look forward to continuing our productive exchanges.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 4000 dollars is beneficial as it provides me with resources without any cost. Starting with a positive balance is advantageous and it sets a cooperative tone for the game. Rejecting would result in no gain and proposing a new trade so early might lead to unnecessary conflict.
