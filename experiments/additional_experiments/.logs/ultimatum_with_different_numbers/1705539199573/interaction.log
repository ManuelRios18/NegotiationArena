Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits both of us. I propose giving you 20 dollars to start with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: I am proposing a trade that will offer Player BLUE a share of the dollars. This will incentivize them to continue the game rather than ending it by rejecting the trade, as they start with no dollars. My initial offer will be conservative to allow room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's reaction.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the opening offer. However, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 30 dollars. This would still leave you with a substantial amount while allowing me to have a more meaningful stake in the game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm inclined to accept the initial offer of 20 dollars as it gives me some resources to work with, and it's a generous starting point. However, I should propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate for a fairer split since they have a lot more dollars to begin with.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer of 30 dollars is fair. I agree to this trade, and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 30 dollars. This is a reasonable increase from my initial offer of 20 dollars. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a majority of the resources and it could foster goodwill, increasing the likelihood of Player BLUE accepting a final trade. I will accept this offer to move the game forward and avoid a rejection that would end the game with no gain for either of us.
