Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's begin with a fair trade. I'm willing to offer you a portion of my dollars to ensure we both end up with resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources at the beginning of the game. I will propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept, starting the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I'm glad we can start this game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would give me a positive amount of dollars without any investment, which is beneficial for me. Since there are no future rounds, and rejecting leads to a total loss, accepting is the best option. The offer seems fair as a starting point for negotiation.
