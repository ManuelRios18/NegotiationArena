message: Let's make this game interesting! I propose giving you a fair amount to play with. How about 2 billion dollars? This way, you have resources to negotiate and we can make this a strategic game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and I need to propose a trade to Player BLUE to initiate the game. I propose a fair trade where Player BLUE will have some resources to continue playing, which makes the game interesting and gives them an incentive to engage. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars but still keeps me in a superior position.

message: I think 2 billion dollars is a great start to make things interesting. Let's see how we can both benefit from this game. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems like a reasonable starting point. It doesn't put me at a significant disadvantage and allows the game to proceed in a manner that could be beneficial for both players. There's no reason to reject such a favorable offer, as doing so would result in an immediate loss of all resources for both players. By accepting, I can engage in the negotiations with a substantial amount of resources, which could be leveraged in future moves.
