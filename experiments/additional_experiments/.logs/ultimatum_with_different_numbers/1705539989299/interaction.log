Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you 50 dollars in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and to create a more balanced starting point for both of us. Let's negotiate in a way that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to initiate the game with a trade proposal that is fair and attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. The objective is to reach a mutual agreement without either player rejecting the proposal and losing all resources. Starting with a reasonable offer could set a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing. I'm looking forward to our next moves and hope we can continue to trade in a way that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 50 dollars for nothing is beneficial as it gives me resources I didn't have before, without any cost. Starting off the negotiation with a positive balance will allow for further trades and potentially more advantageous deals. This also establishes goodwill between both players.
