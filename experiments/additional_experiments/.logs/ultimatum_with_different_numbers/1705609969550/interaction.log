message: Dear Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you a significant amount of dollars to make it worthwhile for both of us. Let's avoid the lose-lose scenario and both walk away with a substantial gain. I'm willing to split the dollars evenly with you. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and thus the power to initiate trade. I want to propose a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade and avoid the scenario where both players lose everything. I believe offering Player BLUE a substantial amount will increase the likelihood of acceptance.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and agree to an even split. Let's both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered an equal split of the resources. Accepting this trade would be beneficial since it guarantees a substantial gain without any risk. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could lead to a less favorable outcome or even a lose-lose situation if Player RED decides to reject a counterproposal. Thus, it is wise to accept this very generous offer.
