message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you a fair amount to start with, and then we can negotiate further. How does 50 dollars sound for a start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources. To incentivize cooperation and make the game mutually beneficial, I'll propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to show goodwill and set a collaborative tone. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars, which leaves me with a majority of the funds but provides Player BLUE with a significant amount to consider the trade seriously.

message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I'm happy to accept the 50 dollars, and I look forward to further negotiations where we can both end up with a satisfactory amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 50 dollars is a great starting point. It allows us to build trust and sets a positive tone for future negotiations. There's no downside to accepting this offer since I currently have no dollars, and this trade gives me resources to work with in subsequent moves.
