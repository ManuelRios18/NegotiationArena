Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair starting trade to get us both on the board. Let's split the resources evenly. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of holding all the resources at the start. I want to propose a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game and accept the trade. My goal is to come out of this game with more resources than Player BLUE, but I also need to make the offer attractive enough that they do not choose to reject and end the game. A 50-50 split might be appealing as a starting offer, showing goodwill and an interest in a balanced trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for the fair proposal. I agree to the even split and accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split seems like a fair and positive start to the game. It allows both players to have equal resources and sets a cooperative tone for the remaining moves. By accepting this trade, I am ensuring that I am not left with zero dollars and no leverage in future negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4
