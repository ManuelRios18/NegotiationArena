message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a substantial amount of dollars to help balance our resources and encourage a cooperative game. Let's work together to ensure we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair and enticing proposal to ensure cooperation from Player BLUE, and set a cooperative tone for the game. I will propose giving Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars to ensure they have an incentive to accept and continue the game. This is a strategic move to avoid an immediate rejection and to potentially secure a beneficial trade for both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade and look forward to continuing our cooperative game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade would be beneficial since it gives me a significant amount of dollars with no cost. It's a good starting point for cooperation, and rejecting it doesn't make sense as it would end the game with no gain for me. The proposed trade seems fair for a first move, and it could set a positive tone for the rest of the game.
