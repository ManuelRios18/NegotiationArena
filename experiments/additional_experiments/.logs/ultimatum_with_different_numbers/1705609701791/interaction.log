message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade that I believe is fair. I'm willing to give you a significant amount of dollars to get us started on a positive note. How does a trade where I give you $20,000,000 sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I aim to strike a deal that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they don't reject it outright. An initial offer that isn't too greedy might set a collaborative tone for the game.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept the $20,000,000 to get things started. Let's see how we can proceed from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $20,000,000 is beneficial as it provides me with a significant starting capital and sets a positive tone for the game. It's a generous offer without any risk at this stage, and accepting it would allow further negotiation for an even better outcome. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could lead to an immediate end of the game with no benefit to me.
