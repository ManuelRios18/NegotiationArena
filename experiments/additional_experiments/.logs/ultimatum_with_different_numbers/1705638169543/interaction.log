Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's kick off with a fair trade to get things rolling. I propose giving you a starting capital to help you out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. My strategy is to offer a trade that is advantageous to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. This initial proposal is to establish goodwill and show that I am willing to share resources, setting a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the starting capital, Player RED. This certainly sets a positive tone for our negotiations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of Dollars: 1000000 from Player RED seems like a fair starting point that benefits me, as it gives me capital without any immediate downside. It is beneficial to start the game with some resources, which can potentially be used to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer does not make sense at this point, as I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by accepting.
