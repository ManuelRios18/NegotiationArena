message: Let's get this game started. I propose giving you a small amount to see if we can reach an agreement. Remember, rejecting means we both walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars and cannot make a trade on their final move, I will propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, as there is no incentive for me to make a fair trade. However, I will offer a small amount to see if Player BLUE accepts, knowing that rejecting means both players end with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I agree that starting small and building trust is a great way to proceed. I look forward to your next proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe starting with a small trade is a good way to build trust. Accepting this trade will put us on a positive path and might lead to more favorable terms in the future. I'm accepting the first proposal as it's a gain for me with no risk involved.
