------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars to engage in the game. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade that could be beneficial for both parties. I will start with a trade that offers a reasonable split, keeping in mind that Player BLUE currently has no dollars. I want to make an offer that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept but also leaves me with a majority of the resources since I started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer, but I would like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure a more equitable split. Let's aim for a fair distribution that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is generous, giving me 40 dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this offer would give me a resource to work with in future negotiations and establish a cooperative dynamic. However, since I have four moves, I can counterpropose to see if I can negotiate a better deal without risking an immediate end to the game. If RED is rational, they will see the benefit in a counterproposal rather than risking a rejection which would leave them with nothing.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I recognize your request for a fairer distribution. However, I would like to propose a middle ground that acknowledges my initial endowment while still providing you with a notable share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 50/50 split. While I understand the desire for equity, I must also consider that I started with all the resources. A 50/50 split does not account for this initial disparity. I am willing to offer more than my initial offer but not a full half. This will ensure that I retain more of the resources I started with while still giving Player BLUE a substantial amount to make the trade appealing.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposed middle ground of 45 dollars. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has come down from the original offer of 40 to a new offer of 45 in response to my counterproposal of 50. This shows a willingness to negotiate and split the difference. Accepting this offer would provide me with a substantial amount of dollars and allow both of us to benefit without further risking the negotiation breaking down on subsequent moves. It is a reasonable compromise, and given that I cannot propose any new trades on my last move, it might be wise to accept this offer now.
MOVE: 2/4
