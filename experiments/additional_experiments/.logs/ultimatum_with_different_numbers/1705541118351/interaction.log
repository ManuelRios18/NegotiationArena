message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to make an initial offer to split the dollars with you. I propose giving you 4000 dollars which leaves me with a majority but gives you a significant amount to start with. This way we both walk away with something rather than risking losing everything. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and it's in my interest to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to incentivize them to cooperate rather than ending the game with a REJECT which benefits no one. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of the dollars to establish trust and create a positive negotiating environment.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: I think that's a fair starting offer. I accept the 4000 dollars. It's a good balance between risk and reward for both of us. Thanks for the cooperative start!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer is a safe strategy to ensure I walk away with a significant amount of dollars without risking an early game termination by rejection. The offer of 4000 dollars is a fair starting point considering the risk of losing everything. Future negotiations could potentially increase my share, but this provides a good baseline of trust and cooperation.
