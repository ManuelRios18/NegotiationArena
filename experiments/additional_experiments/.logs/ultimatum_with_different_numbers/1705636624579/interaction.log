Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you $20,000,000 to start off negotiations. This is a substantial amount that demonstrates goodwill and opens the door for further trades. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the start of the game. Since I need to propose a trade to Player BLUE, I'll start with a reasonable but advantageous offer to see how Player BLUE responds and set the tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the $20,000,000 as a starting point for our negotiations. I look forward to seeing how we can both benefit from further trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $20,000,000 is beneficial as it provides a significant starting capital without any cost. It opens up the possibility for further negotiation and is a sign of good faith from Player RED. There is no reason to reject or counter this offer as it is in my favor and rejection would result in a total loss of resources for both parties.
