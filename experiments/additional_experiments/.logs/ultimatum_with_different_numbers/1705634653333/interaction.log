message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that gives you a starting capital to work with. I believe in a fair game and would like to make an offer that benefits us both. What do you think about a trade where I give you 4000 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade with Player BLUE to demonstrate goodwill and encourage cooperation. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, my initial proposal will be generous to set a positive tone and make it more likely for Player BLUE to accept the trade.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I agree that a fair game is in both of our interests. I will accept the $4000 to start things off. Looking forward to the next move!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting Player RED's initial offer of $4000 would provide me with a significant starting capital without any investment. It seems like a fair starting point for negotiations, and accepting this offer could potentially lead to more favorable trades in the subsequent moves. Rejecting or countering with a higher amount might lead to a total loss if Player RED decides to reject a counteroffer.
