message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose a fair split of resources to ensure we both come out of this game positively. Let's work together and both end with a good share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm initiating the game with a trade proposal. My goal is to reach a fair agreement with Player BLUE. I will propose a trade giving Player BLUE some dollars in exchange for nothing since Player BLUE has no dollars to trade. This will incentivize cooperation and ensure that we both end the game with some resources. I will propose a 50-50 split as it is equal and fair, and it might increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the 50/50 split. It's a pleasure to cooperate with you for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a split of 50 dollars, which is a fair initial offer considering they started with 100 dollars. It would be in both of our interests to accept a fair trade to ensure we both end the game with resources.
