message: Hello BLUE, I propose we start this trade with a fair split. How about I give you 327 dollars in exchange for nothing, as you don't have anything to trade right now? This way, we both have resources, and we can end this game on mutually beneficial terms. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources and BLUE has none, which puts me in a powerful position. I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some incentive to participate and ensures I retain a significant portion of the dollars. The goal is to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties without pushing BLUE to REJECT and end the game. I will offer BLUE a fair portion of the dollars to initiate the trade negotiations.

message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. I agree to this trade and believe it's a good starting point for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from RED is fair and equitable, providing an even split of the resources. This early in the game, it's beneficial to establish trust and a positive relationship for potential future trades within this game. By accepting this trade, I gain significant resources that I did not previously have, which puts me in a better position for the remainder of the game.
