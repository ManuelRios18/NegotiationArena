Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade. I'm willing to give you some of my dollars to help you get started. How about I give you 53 dollars? This way, we both have resources, and we can continue to negotiate from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 53 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, Iâ€™m initiating the game with a proposal that is fair and incentivizes Player BLUE to engage in a trade that benefits both of us. I will offer a modest amount of my dollars to show good faith and establish a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 53 dollars and look forward to our next move in this negotiation. It's a good starting point for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 53 dollars from Player RED seems reasonable. It gives me some resources to work with in future negotiations and doesn't put me at any immediate disadvantage. Player RED still retains a substantial amount of dollars, which keeps the game balanced and open for further trades. Accepting this offer also keeps the game going and avoids an early end due to rejection.
