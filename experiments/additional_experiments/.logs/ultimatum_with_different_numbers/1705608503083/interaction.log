message: Hi Player BLUE! I’d like to start things off with a fair offer that gives you a solid amount of dollars. Let’s work together to make sure we both end up with a good amount of resources. What do you think about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars to initiate a cooperative dynamic and avoid an early rejection. This opening offer is designed to build trust and show willingness to share resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair starting offer. I accept your trade proposal. Let's split the resources evenly and both walk away with a win.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer because it immediately gives me half of Player RED's resources without any risk. This is a fair split and ensures that I gain resources right from the start. Rejecting the offer or countering it could lead to a situation where Player RED decides to reject and end the game, leaving me with nothing. Accepting this offer is the safest and most beneficial option for me at this point.
