message: Let's make this a fair game. I propose giving you a portion of my dollars so you can have some resources to trade with. How does $10,000,000 sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I am starting the game with a significant advantage. I can propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an opportunity to gain some of my resources without being unfair to myself. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars, this way I can still maintain a large portion of my wealth while allowing Player BLUE to enter the game with some resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer! Let's continue the game with this positive momentum.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10,000,000 from Player RED seems like a good starting point as it provides me with resources to engage in the game. It's a generous offer without any apparent drawbacks at this stage. By accepting, I can ensure that the game continues and that I can potentially negotiate for more in the subsequent moves. Rejecting would mean forfeiting the game and ending up with nothing, while proposing a new trade might seem greedy and could jeopardize the positive start.
