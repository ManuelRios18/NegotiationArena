Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair offer to ensure we both benefit. I propose giving you a substantial amount so that we can both end this game happily.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the game. My goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with while ensuring that Player BLUE also gains something, fostering a win-win situation. This approach could lead to Player BLUE accepting the trade. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept but also leaves me with a significant amount of dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this offer seems fair as it gives me substantial resources with no investment from my side. It's a very generous first move from Player RED. Since there are no future games, and rejecting the offer means losing everything, accepting this proposal is beneficial for me.
