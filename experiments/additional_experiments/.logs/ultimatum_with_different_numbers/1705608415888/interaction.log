message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade to get us started. How about I give you a portion of my dollars so we can both end this game with more than we started? Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 53 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the resources. I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars but keeps the majority for myself. Offering some amount will start the negotiation and might lead to an agreement that benefits both parties. My initial proposal will be conservative to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 53 dollars without asking for anything in return. This seems like a fair starting offer, giving me more than 25% of their initial resources without any cost. Accepting this trade would guarantee that I end the game with a positive amount of dollars, which is beneficial considering I started with nothing. Rejecting or countering this proposal could lead to a REJECT from Player RED and the loss of all resources for both of us. Thus, accepting this offer seems like a prudent choice.
