message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade. How about I give you 30 dollars to get you started? This way, we can both end the game with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, while still leaving me with the majority of the dollars. By offering a fair amount, I hope to encourage a cooperative attitude from the start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I think it would be more equitable if the split was a bit more balanced. How about you give me 40 dollars instead? This way, we can both walk away with a substantial amount. Remember, if we don't trade, we both end up with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the initial trade proposed by Player RED. Since I start with no dollars, accepting the 30 dollars would give me resources I didn't have. However, I could potentially negotiate for a better split since Player RED is likely interested in a trade to avoid ending with nothing. I'll propose a counteroffer that still provides Player RED with a majority but gives me a more significant share.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal of 40 dollars. It's important for both of us to walk away with a meaningful amount. Let's confirm this trade and both benefit from the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate for a better deal, which is expected. Offering 40 dollars is still within a reasonable range to keep a majority of the resources while ensuring cooperation. Accepting this proposal may lead to a quick resolution and a guaranteed split, which is better than risking a total loss if the negotiation fails later.
MOVE: 2 / 4
