message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you get a start in this game. I'm offering you 3000 dollars for no return just to make the game interesting. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I start with a significant advantage having all the resources. I need to propose a trade that seems fair enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still maintaining an advantage for myself. By proposing an equitable trade, I increase the chances of a successful negotiation, which would be beneficial to both parties. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an opportunity to gain resources without leaving myself at too much of a disadvantage.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to seeing how we can further benefit from each other in the next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 3000 dollars is beneficial as it gives me resources to negotiate with in the next moves. There is no downside to accepting this trade since I'm not giving anything in return. It provides a foundation for future proposals and places me in a better position for negotiation.
