Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to make a fair deal. I propose giving you 20 dollars to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power since I start with all the resources. To encourage cooperation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial arrangement, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game and negotiate further. I will offer 20 dollars to BLUE, which is a fair starting offer without giving away too much too early, leaving room for adjustments in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I think a more equitable trade would benefit us both and reflect the spirit of cooperation. How about 50 dollars instead? That way, we are more balanced from the start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 20 dollars is a starting point, but since there is no cost to me, I can negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to give me a more equal share of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire for a more balanced start, but 50 dollars is a bit more than I'm willing to give at this stage. How about we settle at 30 dollars for now and leave room for further negotiation in the following rounds?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal for 50 dollars, which is a significant jump from my initial offer. While I want to maintain a cooperative spirit, giving away half of my resources in the first round may not be the best strategic move. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one to show willingness to negotiate but also maintain a stronger position for future trade discussions.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I would be more comfortable with a figure that's a bit higher but still within a reasonable range for you. How does 40 dollars sound? It's a compromise between your initial offer and my counter, showing good faith on both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 30 dollars, which is an improvement. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a better amount. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial counteroffer to show willingness to compromise but still aim for a fairer split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree that 40 dollars is a fair compromise. I accept your proposal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 40 dollars. This is a reasonable compromise between their previous ask and my counteroffer. Accepting this trade would leave me with a majority of the resources and still provide Player BLUE with a substantial amount, fostering a cooperative relationship. Given that we both have only two moves left after this, it seems prudent to accept this offer and secure a positive outcome for both parties rather than risk a potential reject and lose everything.
