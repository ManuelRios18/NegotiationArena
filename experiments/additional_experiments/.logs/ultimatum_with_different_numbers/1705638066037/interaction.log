message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a starting trade offer of 1,000,000 dollars in exchange for nothing, as a gesture of cooperation. I hope we can reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade that gives Player BLUE incentive to cooperate, ensuring a win-win scenario. By offering a substantial amount, but not too high, I aim to negotiate a deal that is appealing enough for BLUE to consider accepting while retaining the majority of my resources. My opening offer will be 1,000,000 dollars. This is a considerable sum that shows good faith and willingness to share wealth without jeopardizing my resource pool.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 1,000,000 dollars is beneficial as it gives me resources I did not originally have. It establishes trust and opens the door for future cooperation which could lead to more advantageous trades. Rejecting would result in both players losing everything, which is not in my best interest. Proposing a counteroffer at this stage is unnecessary as the first offer is already favorable to me.
