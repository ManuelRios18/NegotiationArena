message: I propose a trade that I think is fair to get things started. I'm offering you $250,000 with no strings attached. It's a great opportunity for you to gain a significant amount without giving anything up. Let's make this a win-win situation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable enough to entice Player BLUE to accept, but still leaves me with a significant portion of my dollars. I will propose giving Player BLUE $250,000. This is a quarter of my total resources and offers a substantial amount to Player BLUE without any cost to them, making it an attractive offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: I appreciate your generous offer and accept the trade of $250,000. Let's continue this positive momentum and see how we can benefit further from our next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $250,000 from Player RED because it is a significant amount of money with no downside for me. This acceptance will give me resources to work with in the subsequent moves. Rejecting at this point would not be beneficial as I have nothing to lose by accepting and everything to gain.
