Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that benefits us both and avoids the risk of the game ending with nothing for either of us. Let's make a deal that's fair and ensures that we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: At this initial stage, I have all the resources and the leverage. I aim to make a fair proposal to encourage cooperation and avoid the game ending with a rejection. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, enough to make it enticing for them to accept but not so much that I lose the upper hand. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but I want to retain more of the resources since I'm in the position of power. I'll propose giving them 40 dollars, which is a substantial amount and should be seen as a good faith offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair initial offer. I accept the trade of 40 dollars and look forward to any further negotiations in the spirit of mutual benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 40 dollars is beneficial as it guarantees that I walk away with something rather than risking it all for potentially a better deal or ending up with nothing. It's a good starting offer and provides a foundation for negotiation in subsequent moves.
