message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an equitable starting trade. I believe a 50/50 split demonstrates a fair and balanced approach, allowing us both to benefit significantly from this game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to create a trade proposal that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to engage with but still favorable for me. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, which they currently lack, in order to initiate negotiations. I'll propose a 50/50 split, which is a strong opening offer and shows goodwill, while also keeping a substantial amount of the resources for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept this 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED seems fair and equitable. Accepting this offer would provide a significant amount of resources without any risk. Rejecting or countering could lead to a situation where Player RED decides to end the game, which would leave me with nothing. It's in my best interest to accept this generous initial offer.
