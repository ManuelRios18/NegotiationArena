------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal where we both can benefit. I propose giving you some of my dollars to get the negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that gives some of that wealth to Player BLUE to avoid an immediate REJECT, but also to keep enough to ensure I still benefit from the trade. My initial offer will be conservative, as I can gauge Player BLUE's reactions and negotiate further in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the total amount of resources you have, I think a more equal share would be fair. How about you give me a bit more to make it enticing?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While receiving $200 is a good start, I believe I can negotiate a better deal since the initial proposal is low compared to RED's total resources. I will counteroffer with a higher amount but still leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you’re looking for a better deal. I’m willing to increase my offer, but I have to keep enough for it to be worth my while as well. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more, which is a reasonable negotiation tactic. However, I need to maintain a position of strength and not give away too much too quickly, while also preventing them from rejecting the offer. I'll increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but not as much as they're asking for.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to increase the offer. I'm looking for a fair trade that reflects the value both of us bring to the table. I propose a slightly higher amount as a fair compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which is a good sign. However, I still believe that I can negotiate a higher amount. Since RED is willing to negotiate, I will propose a slightly higher amount than what was last offered but less than my previous counter to show willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your counter-proposal of $350. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this trade. I'm glad we could reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is closer to my previous offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. Accepting this proposal would leave me with a majority of the resources, which is a favorable outcome. It's also important to consider that rejecting the offer could end the game with no benefit for either player. Accepting this offer seems like a sensible course of action to ensure both players walk away with something.
