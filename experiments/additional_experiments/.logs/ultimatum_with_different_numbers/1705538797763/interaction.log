message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose a starting trade where you receive a sum of dollars that gives you an incentive to continue the game, and I still keep the majority. How about I give you 7 dollars to start with? This leaves me with a comfortable amount and gives you a foundation to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with all dollars in my possession. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. If the trade is too unfavorable, Player BLUE might reject and end the game, causing both of us to lose everything. It's in my best interest to start with a reasonable offer to keep the game going and potentially negotiate a better deal.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I accept your offer of 7 dollars. Let's continue the game and see if we can find more mutually beneficial terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal of 7 dollars would give me some resources to work with, which is better than having none. It also keeps the game going and allows for further negotiation. It's a fair starting point.
