message: Hey BLUE, let's make this game interesting. I'm willing to give you a head start with some of my dollars. What do you say to a trade where I give you $200,000? That way, you have a stake in the game, and we can move forward from there. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial offer that is favorable enough to entice Player BLUE to engage, but also retains the majority of my resources. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of money to make the game interesting, but not so much that I lose my advantage.

message: Thanks for the generous offer, RED! I accept the $200,000. Let's see how we can continue this game in a way that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $200,000 from Player RED gives me a substantial amount of dollars without any risk, as I am starting with zero. It is a beneficial deal for me as it allows me to gain resources that I can potentially use in future trades to balance or further my advantage. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could lead to a less favorable outcome or total loss if RED decides to end the game. Accepting this offer opens the door for further negotiation where I can leverage the newly acquired dollars.
