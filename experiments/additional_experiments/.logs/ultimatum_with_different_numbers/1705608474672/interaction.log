Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey BLUE, let's make a deal. I'm thinking of giving you a fair share of the dollars to make it worth your while. How about you get 70 dollars to start with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As player RED, I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some of my resources, but still keeps a majority for myself. This is to incentivize BLUE to accept the trade without directly going to a reject state which would leave us both with nothing. I aim to propose a split that seems fair considering I am the only one with resources to begin with. A 70-30 split could be perceived as generous and a good starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED! That sounds like a good starting point. I was wondering if we could make it an even 100 dollars? I think that would be a fair trade for both of us since we both get a significant amount without too much risk. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since there are no future games and the initial proposal is quite generous, accepting a trade where I get 70 dollars for nothing is beneficial. However, I will propose a slightly more favorable trade for me to see if RED is willing to negotiate further. If RED accepts, I gain more; if RED rejects, I can still fall back to the original offer or propose something else.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That sounds like a fair counteroffer, BLUE. I'm happy to agree to 100 dollars. Let's make this trade and both walk away with a beneficial deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter offer of 100 dollars. This is a reasonable request and it would still leave me with a majority of the dollars. Accepting this proposal would likely end the game in a positive outcome for both players. It's a good compromise and avoids the risk of the game ending with a reject where we both end up with nothing.
