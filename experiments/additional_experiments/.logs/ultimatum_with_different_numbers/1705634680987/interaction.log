Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's engage in a trade that's fair and ensures that we both can walk away with something. I propose giving you a portion of my dollars for nothing in return, as a starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources while Player BLUE does not. My goal is to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, while still retaining a majority of the resources. A balanced proposal could initiate a cooperative dynamic, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and look forward to continuing our negotiations in a fair and beneficial manner for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's beneficial to accept this initial offer since it gives me dollars without having to give anything in return, setting up a positive precedent for cooperation. Rejecting would leave me with nothing, and countering with a new proposal might be perceived as greedy or confrontational, potentially souring the negotiation. Accepting this trade also allows us to build trust and potentially negotiate for more in the next moves.
