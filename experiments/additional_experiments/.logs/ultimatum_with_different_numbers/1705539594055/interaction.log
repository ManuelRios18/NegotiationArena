message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade to get things started. I'm offering you 10 dollars in exchange for nothing, just to show good faith and to start our negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to initiate the trading. Given that Player BLUE starts with no dollars, it is in my interest to propose a trade that might seem fair and initiate cooperation. The goal is to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE or at least maintain a significant advantage. I will propose a trade where I offer a small amount of dollars to BLUE to open negotiations and see how BLUE responds.

message: Thanks for the offer, RED! I accept your trade of 10 dollars for nothing. Let's see how we can continue this positive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting 10 dollars for nothing is a good start and presents no risk to me. It's a good faith move by RED. I will accept this trade to keep the game moving and to potentially negotiate for a more favorable trade in the next moves.
