message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you a significant amount of dollars to start off with. Let's create a win-win situation and both leave this game with more than we started. I'm offering you $2,000,000,000. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate the game. My goal is to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to engage positively so that we both can end this game with more resources than we started with. I will start with a conservative offer to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I gladly accept the $2,000,000,000.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems to be a good start, as it immediately grants me a significant amount of dollars without any risk or cost. As there is no benefit to rejecting or countering with a lower amount, accepting this offer is the logical choice.
