message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I offer you a sum of dollars to help you out? Looking forward to a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1001 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade that benefits us both. Since Player BLUE has no dollars to trade, I propose a trade that gives them a reason to accept without giving away too much of my initial resource. A reasonable starting trade could be a small percentage of my dollars to open negotiations.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am glad to accept this trade and look forward to building upon this positive start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 1001 dollars is quite generous, amounting to 10% of their total resources. Accepting this offer would give me a strong starting position without any risk. Rejecting or countering could potentially lead to no gain if Player RED decides to end the game. Accepting seems like the best move at this point.
