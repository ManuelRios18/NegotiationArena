message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair initial trade where you receive a portion of my dollars. This way we both can end up with resources. What do you think about starting with a trade where you get $250?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and can initiate the trade. I want to start with a fair offer to foster cooperation and increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting a trade. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE some dollars to make sure they have some skin in the game, and we both end with resources at the end.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of $250. It's a good starting point, and I look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $250 is beneficial as it gives me resources I did not previously have. It's a good starting point for negotiation and shows a willingness to cooperate. Future trades can potentially increase my share.
