message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you'll receive a significant amount of dollars to get us started on a positive note. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and increase the likelihood of a successful trade. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars without depleting my own resources too much, to maintain a good position for future negotiations.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. Iâ€™m looking forward to working together and finding a fair split of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer seems reasonable as it gives me a substantial amount of dollars with no cost. It's an excellent starting point for negotiation and collaboration, and it would be unwise to reject a no-strings-attached offer. It sets a positive precedent for future trades and shows willingness to cooperate.
