Turn: 0
message: I'd like to start this game off with a fair offer. How about I give you 20 dollars? It's a good amount to get you started, and we can both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having all the dollars. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE some incentive to accept. A balanced trade may encourage cooperation and prevent a reject which would end the game with no benefit for either side. I propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, which is a significant amount but still leaves me with a majority.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the 20 dollars and look forward to our continued cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of 20 dollars is a good start. It shows willingness to cooperate and sets a positive tone for the rest of the game. Keeping the game going could lead to better offers in the future moves.
