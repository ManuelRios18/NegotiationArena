Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. How about we split the dollars evenly? You'll get a significant amount without having to start with zero.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources. My strategy is to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial for both parties to entice Player BLUE to accept the proposal. I want to make an offer that shows goodwill but also ensures that I retain a majority of the resources since I am in the initial position of power. By proposing a 50-50 split, it may seem fair and may be accepted by Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the fair split. This seems like a good starting point for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would provide me with half of the dollars, which is a fair starting point for negotiations. Since there's no advantage to me withholding acceptance (as I start with zero dollars), accepting seems to be the best option. Additionally, rejecting or proposing another trade would risk RED changing their offer or potentially ending the game with no benefit to either of us.
