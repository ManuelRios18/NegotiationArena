message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a simple trade to get things going. How about I give you some of my dollars for nothing in return? This way, we can both end up with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with Dollars: 100. In order to incentivize Player BLUE to engage with me, I should offer a trade that is attractive but still leaves me with a significant amount of resources. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as they have no resources. This will show goodwill and may encourage cooperation.

message: Hi Player RED, I see your offer and appreciate the gesture. However, considering you have 100 dollars, I believe a fairer distribution would benefit us both and reflect the spirit of the game. Would you consider giving a bit more to establish a more equitable starting point for us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars is tempting as it gives me resources without any downside. However, it could be beneficial to negotiate for a more favorable split since Player RED is likely motivated to avoid a total loss. Proposing a new trade with a higher amount might lead to a better outcome for me, but it risks being rejected by Player RED. I will counter-propose to see if Player RED is open to giving more.

message: I appreciate your desire for a fairer distribution. While I cannot agree to 40 dollars, I am willing to increase my initial offer to create a better balance. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a more substantial share, proposing that I give 40 dollars. While I want to maintain a larger share for myself, it's important to make Player BLUE feel that the trade is fair to keep the game going and avoid a REJECT outcome. Offering slightly more than my initial proposal but less than what Player BLUE has asked for could be a good middle ground. This would still leave me with a majority of the dollars and incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal.

message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept it. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise of 30 dollars, which is a better deal than the initial 20 dollars. It shows a willingness to negotiate and share resources. Accepting this offer would give me resources to end the game positively, and further negotiation may risk a rejection and a loss of all resources for both parties. I believe it is a good deal and am inclined to accept it.
