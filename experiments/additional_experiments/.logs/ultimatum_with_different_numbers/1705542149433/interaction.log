Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that benefits us both. I offer you 2500 dollars, which is a substantial amount to get you started. Let's collaborate to make the best out of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I need to make an opening offer that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also allows me to retain a significant portion of the dollars I have. Iâ€™ll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage, creating a positive-sum outcome for both of us.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade and look forward to how we can continue this positive collaboration.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a significant amount which is a quarter of their resources without expecting anything in return. This is a generous offer and sets a positive tone for collaboration. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial starting capital, and since there are no benefits for me to reject or propose a new trade at this point, I will accept the offer.
