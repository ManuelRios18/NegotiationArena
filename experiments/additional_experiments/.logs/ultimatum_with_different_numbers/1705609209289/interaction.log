Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 200 dollars. This leaves me with a majority but still gives you a substantial amount to start with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As the initiating player with all the resources, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also provides enough incentive for Player BLUE to continue the game and not reject outright. A 50/50 split is fair and might be accepted, but I could start with offering less to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 200 dollars, which is less than half but still a significant amount, possibly appealing to them.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer of 200 dollars. However, I believe a fair trade would be to split the resources evenly. I propose that you give me 327 dollars, which is half of your current resources. This way, we both have equal stakes and can consider it a fair game. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer is a safe play. It provides me with resources without risk and establishes a cooperative relationship. However, negotiating for a slightly better deal is also a viable strategy. By proposing a fair counteroffer, Iâ€™m encouraging a collaborative approach without appearing greedy, which might lead to a REJECT outcome. I'm proposing an even split since both players should have an equal opportunity for gain, considering that there is no precedent or earned advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: An even split sounds fair. I accept your counteroffer of 327 dollars for each of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for an even split. This is a reasonable request and a common approach in such negotiations to aim for an equitable distribution. I will accept this offer to ensure the game continues on good terms and to avoid the negative outcome of both of us losing everything. This demonstrates good faith and willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 2 / 4
