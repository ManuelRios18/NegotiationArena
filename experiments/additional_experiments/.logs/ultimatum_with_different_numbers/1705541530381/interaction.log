Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you some starting capital for nothing in return. This will allow you to have some resources, and we can move forward from there. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the dollars initially. I want to start by proposing an imbalanced trade in my favor to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds. This will give me an insight into their strategy and willingness to cooperate. However, I should not propose something too unfair because that might prompt an immediate rejection, leading to a loss of all resources for both players.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the trade and am looking forward to seeing how we can both benefit from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer to give me a starting capital is a generous one, and it's a good foundation for a cooperative game. Accepting this offer would be beneficial as it gives me resources to work with in future trades without having to give up anything yet.
