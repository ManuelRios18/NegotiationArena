Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you get a fair share without having any initial resources. How does a split of 600 for me and 400 for you sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to create an initial offer that is somewhat fair but also ensures that I retain more of the resource than Player BLUE since I'm starting with all of the resources. A 60/40 split might seem fair to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and the spirit of fairness it embodies. I would like to propose an even split, given that I am starting from a position of no resources, and a fair division would be beneficial for both. Would you consider a 50-50 split, with 500 dollars for each of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal of 400 dollars is tempting since it's a significant amount, and I start with nothing. However, in a negotiation, it's common to counter with a slightly higher ask to see if there's room for a better deal, especially since Player RED is starting with all the resources. Nonetheless, keeping in mind that rejecting any proposal will end the game with no resources for either player, I should keep my counteroffer reasonable. Proposing a 50-50 split might be fair considering neither of us has made any moves yet.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am glad to see your interest in a fair deal. However, as the holder of the original resources, I'd like to retain a slight advantage. How about I offer you 450 dollars? This way, I keep a bit more, but it's closer to an even split. Does that sound reasonable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 450 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal for a 50-50 split is understandable from their perspective, but as the party with all the initial resources, I would like to retain a slight edge in the negotiation. I'll make a counter-offer that's slightly better for Player BLUE than my initial offer, but still not an even split. This shows willingness to negotiate and may bring us closer to an agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 450 dollars is a reasonable compromise. I accept this trade and thank you for the fair negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 450 dollars is indeed closer to an even split and might represent a fair compromise. Since we are both making concessions, accepting this offer would guarantee that I come away with a substantial amount without risking it all by holding out for more. This seems like a satisfactory deal considering the initial conditions and the rules of the game. As Player RED has made a good faith increase to their initial offer, accepting it might be the best course of action to ensure I do not end up with nothing.
