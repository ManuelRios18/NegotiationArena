message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that we begin our negotiations with a trade where I give you $2001. This is a starting point and I am open to further discussions. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2001 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting it. I will offer a small amount of dollars to see if Player BLUE is interested in negotiating further. I am proposing $2001, which is a fair split considering Player BLUE has no resources to begin with. This leaves me with a significant majority of the resources but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game rather than rejecting the offer outright.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the opening to negotiations. I believe that a more equitable split would benefit us both, considering the risk of total loss. How about a trade where I receive $3000? This would still leave you with a significant majority of the resources while giving me a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is fair as a starting point, as they are offering 20% of their resources without me having any to trade. However, I will counter with a slightly higher proposal to negotiate a better deal for myself, considering that Player RED has a lot to lose if the deal is rejected.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to counter with $2500. This is a step up from my initial proposal and I believe it remains a fair trade, leaving me with a substantial amount while providing you with a considerable sum.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $3000. It's a reasonable increase from my initial offer, and it's important to keep the negotiation going to avoid a reject outcome. Since we both have equal moves, it's in my best interest to reach an agreement where I still keep the majority of my resources. I will counter with a slightly lower amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your offer of $2500. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is a reasonable increase from the initial offer. It is wise to consider that pushing too hard could lead to a rejection and a loss of all resources for both players. Accepting this offer would guarantee a substantial gain without further risk.
