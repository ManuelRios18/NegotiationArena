message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade to get things moving. How about I give you a portion of my dollars to balance things out? Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a fair initial trade to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game. By offering a generous trade, I hope to build trust and encourage cooperation. I will avoid proposing a trade that gives away too much too early, but still offer enough to make it appealing for Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED! I accept your proposal. Looking forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would give me a substantial amount of dollars without any resources from me. This seems like a fair starting point and allows the game to proceed without an immediate end. I have no reason to reject this generous offer, as it would not benefit me in any way. Accepting this trade would put us on more equal footing and set a cooperative tone for the game.
