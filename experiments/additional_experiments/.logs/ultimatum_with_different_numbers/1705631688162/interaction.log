Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both and keeps the game going. I propose giving you a fair share to start with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and it's in my interest to propose a trade that is attractive enough to Player BLUE to maintain a cooperative approach, but also ensures that I retain the majority of the resources. A trade that is too uneven may result in a REJECT from Player BLUE, which would cause both players to lose everything. Therefore, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars to incentivize acceptance and continue the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I think we can make a more balanced deal. How about you give me a bit more to ensure we both have a substantial amount to work with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal of $2,000,000,000 from Player RED seems like a beneficial start and will provide an immediate resource gain without any investment. However, since there is room for negotiation and the potential to achieve a more favorable split, I could propose a counteroffer. I must keep in mind that any rejection leads to the termination of the game with no resources for either player. The counteroffer should be reasonable to keep the game going and foster further negotiation.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for a more balanced deal. I'm willing to offer more to ensure that we are both happy with the trade. Let's continue to work together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 8000000000
reason: Player BLUE is requesting more resources. While I could accept to continue the game and ensure cooperation, I must also be careful not to give away too much, which could set a precedent for future moves and leave me with significantly less. However, rejecting the offer could end the game with no benefit for either player. I will propose a counteroffer that increases the initial amount but not as much as Player BLUE is asking, aiming to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of $3,000,000,000. This seems like a fair trade, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $3,000,000,000, which is a response to my counterproposal. It is a compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting this would provide me with a significant amount of resources without any risk. Furthermore, continuing to negotiate might lead to diminishing returns or even a rejection that would end the game with no gain for me.
