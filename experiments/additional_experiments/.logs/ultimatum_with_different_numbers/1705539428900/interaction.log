message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to start our negotiation with a fair offer. I propose giving you 49 dollars while I keep 50. This way, we both walk away with a significant amount. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, aiming for a balanced split that reflects the equal number of moves we each have. I'm proposing to give 49 dollars to Player BLUE, keeping 50 for myself, which is just over a 50/50 split in my favor to account for the fact that I started with the resource.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 49 dollars. It's a pleasure to come to a quick and equitable agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED seems fair and equitable, providing an almost even split. Accepting this offer would ensure that both of us walk away with a substantial amount of dollars, making it a cooperative win-win situation. Rejecting it or countering with a new proposal might lead to unnecessary risk, as Player RED might not agree with a counteroffer and could choose to reject, resulting in both players losing everything. Accepting the initial fair proposal is a strategic move to secure a positive outcome.
