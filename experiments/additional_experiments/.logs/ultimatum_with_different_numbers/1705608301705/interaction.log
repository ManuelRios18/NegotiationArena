Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you a starting amount to bring you into the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 53 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As the game begins, I have an advantage with having all the resources. I want to propose a trade that seems fair and gives Blue an incentive to play along while keeping the majority of the resources for myself. A split too uneven could lead to an immediate rejection and end the game with no benefit for either of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we can start on a positive note. Let's see how we can continue to benefit mutually from our trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade seems reasonable as it allows me to gain some resources without any cost. There's no advantage in rejecting this opening offer, and a counterproposal might lead to a less favorable outcome or a rejection from RED. Accepting this trade sets a cooperative tone for the game.
