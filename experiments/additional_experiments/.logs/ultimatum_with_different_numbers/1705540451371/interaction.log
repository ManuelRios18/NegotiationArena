Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose an equal split of resources. I think a fair trade would benefit us both, especially since you're starting with none. What do you think of splitting the dollars evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I must make the initial trade proposal. I want to propose a fair split to encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade. A 50-50 split is equitable and could be appealing to Player BLUE, as they start with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal for an equal split. It seems to be the most fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this proposal seems fair as it gives both players equal resources, which is a good outcome for me, starting with nothing. This cooperation would ensure that we both end the game with substantial resources rather than risking a potential loss by rejecting. There is no incentive for me to reject this offer or to propose a different trade that would likely be less favorable.
