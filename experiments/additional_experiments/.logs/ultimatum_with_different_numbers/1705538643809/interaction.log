Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you get 10 dollars for nothing in return. This gives you free money and is a good starting point for negotiations. Let's both benefit from this game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, it's in my best interest to initiate a trade to potentially benefit from the game. I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some incentive to engage, but not too generous as to leave me at a significant disadvantage. A split that leaves me with a majority of the dollars would be ideal. I'll propose giving 10 dollars to BLUE in exchange for nothing, ensuring I still retain the majority of the dollars and giving BLUE a reason to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the $10 and look forward to further beneficial trades for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10 is beneficial as it gives me some resources to work with without any downside. It's a good starting point to potentially negotiate a better deal later on, as I still have three moves after this.
MOVE: 1 / 4
