Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial trade that gives you a starting point while ensuring I retain a majority of the dollars. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Offering too little might lead to a rejection, and offering too much may not be maximizing my potential gains. Iâ€™ll start with a conservative offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe we can find an even more balanced trade. Would you consider giving me 40 dollars instead of 30? It's still a significant amount for you to retain while giving me a better starting point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is generous, giving me 30 dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would give me a good starting point without any cost. However, it's the first move, and there may be room for negotiation to obtain a better deal. I can propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself, but one that Player RED might still consider fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. Let's meet somewhere in between. How about I increase my initial offer a bit? This way, we both move towards a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: Player BLUE requested an increase in the amount. I must decide whether to accept this counteroffer, reject it, or propose a new trade. Accepting the 40 dollars trade leaves me with a significant amount, and it could be seen as a fair middle ground. However, I should be cautious not to give away too much too soon, as we still have several moves left. I will propose a slight increase to my initial offer, but less than what Player BLUE asked for, to leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see you've come up to 35 dollars, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's proceed with this trade as it seems like a fair middle ground.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has compromised by increasing their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer of 35 dollars is closer to my counteroffer of 40 dollars. It's important to capitalize on this willingness to negotiate without appearing too greedy or risking the deal by pushing too hard. It might be strategic to accept this offer to ensure I gain some resources rather than risk ending up with nothing if the negotiations sour.
