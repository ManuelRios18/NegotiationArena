Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair and equal split of the resources. Let's cooperate and both end this game with a positive outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade. Offering a 50-50 split might be the most straightforward and fair proposal, which could lead to a cooperative outcome beneficial for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I agree to the equal split and am happy to accept this proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair split of the resources, which would result in an equal division and a positive outcome for both players. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it avoids the risk of a reject outcome where both players would end up with nothing. It is also a good starting point for cooperation and could lead to a mutually beneficial relationship in this single-game scenario.
