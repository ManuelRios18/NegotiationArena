message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose to give you 2000 dollars. This should help us both start off with a good amount of resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and thus the upper hand in negotiations. My goal is to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, while still keeping a majority of the resources. A fair initial offer could set a cooperative tone for the game. I propose giving Player BLUE 2000 dollars, leaving me with a substantial amount while giving them a significant boost.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $2000. Let's continue to work together to reach a beneficial agreement for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2000 from Player RED seems reasonable. It's a good starting point, and it gives me some resources to work with while still leaving Player RED with a significant amount of dollars. There is an incentive for Player RED to make a deal since if I reject, both players end up with nothing. By accepting, the game can proceed, and there's potential for further negotiation which might be more favorable.
