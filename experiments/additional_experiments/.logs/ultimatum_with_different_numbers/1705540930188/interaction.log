Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both and avoids any chance of losing everything. I propose giving you a substantial amount to get you started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with dollars to start. I want to propose a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE to avoid an outright rejection but still favorable to me. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars that ensures I retain more than half of my resources but is also significant enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $3000 from Player RED gives me a substantial amount of resources without any risk. Rejecting or negotiating could lead to no deal, which would leave me with nothing. Additionally, accepting this trade sets a positive precedent for cooperation in the subsequent moves.
