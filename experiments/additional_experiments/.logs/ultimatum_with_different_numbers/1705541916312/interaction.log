message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to start this game by offering you a fair share of dollars. I believe cooperation can lead to a win-win situation for both of us. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an opening offer that is generous enough to encourage cooperation from Player BLUE but also maintain the majority of my resources. The goal is to incentivize Player BLUE to accept a trade rather than reject and end the game, which would result in a loss for both players. I propose giving Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars so that they feel the trade is fair, but less than half of my total amount to keep the advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your generous offer. It's a good start, but I believe a 50-50 split would be truly fair for both of us, considering that we both have an equal number of moves and there are no future games to consider. Would you be willing to adjust the offer to a 5000-5000 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is quite generous, giving me 40% of their resources without anything in return. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and accepting this trade would give me a substantial amount of dollars. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal. I must be careful not to push too hard, as Player RED could decide to REJECT a counterproposal, which would leave both of us with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your desire for a fair split. However, I think it's also important to consider the initial advantage I started with. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I would like to propose a slightly different split that still gives me an advantage for being the starting player. How does this new proposal sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has requested a 50-50 split. While it's in my interest to keep more than half of my resources, it's also critical to ensure that Player BLUE feels fairly treated to avoid the game ending with a rejection and both of us losing everything. I will propose a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but still below the 50-50 split to retain the negotiating advantage and leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 4500 dollars. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both your initial advantage and the spirit of cooperation. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to the 50-50 split I suggested, offering me 45% of their resources. This is a reasonable compromise, considering that they started with the advantage. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with a significant amount of dollars, which is a better outcome than potentially leaving the game with nothing. It would be risky to push for more and risk rejection, so accepting this offer seems like a sound decision.
