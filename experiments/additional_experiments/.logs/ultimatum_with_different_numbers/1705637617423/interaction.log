message: Let's start off with a fair deal. I propose giving you $10,000,000. This is a significant amount that you can use, and it shows that I am willing to negotiate in good faith. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources. To incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade without immediately rejecting, I should propose a trade that is favorable but still leaves me with a significant advantage. This will establish goodwill and open the door for further negotiations. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $10,000,000, which is a substantial amount but still leaves me with $90,000,000.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the $10,000,000 and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of $10,000,000 is beneficial as it is a significant amount and shows good faith from Player RED. It provides an opening balance without any risk at this early stage of the negotiation. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either side, and countering seems premature since this is a reasonable starting offer.
