Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's get the negotiations started! I propose giving you a starting capital of $200 to make the game more interesting. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: I'm proposing a trade that gives BLUE some starting capital while keeping the majority with me. This is a generous offer to initiate negotiations and demonstrate goodwill. It offers BLUE an opportunity to engage in the game with some resources, possibly leading to a more interesting trade dynamic.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and I think it's a fair way to start the negotiations. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED providing $200 for nothing in return is a good starting point. It provides an immediate benefit without any risk or downside to me. By accepting this offer, I can begin the game with some capital which can be advantageous in future negotiations. There is no reason to reject free capital at this stage as it only improves my position.
