Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation. How about I give you $20 to get the ball rolling? It's a good deal for you since you start with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE a reason to engage and not reject outright. I want to maintain an upper hand in the negotiation by starting with a smaller offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, $20 is a decent starting point. However, I would be more comfortable with a fairer split since we both have an equal number of moves. How about you give me $50? That way we both have skin in the game and it's more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Starting with nothing, getting $20 is a good initial offer. However, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Given that Player RED has more to lose and I have nothing, I can afford to counterpropose for a higher amount. If RED declines, they lose $100 and I lose nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you want a fairer split, but $50 is too much for the first move. Let's meet halfway from your counteroffer and my initial offer. I propose giving you $35. This way, we both have a substantial amount and it's closer to a balanced situation. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $50, seeking an even split. This is a significant increase from my initial offer. I want to negotiate to a point that is more advantageous to me. I will propose a compromise that gives Player BLUE more than my initial offer but less than what they are asking for, in order to keep the negotiation going and to avoid a REJECT outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. $35 is better, but I believe $40 would represent a truly fair middle ground between your first offer and my counteroffer. It's a modest increase from what you've proposed, and it would make the deal more equitable. Shall we settle on $40 and call it a good game?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer of $35 is a compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. It's less than the $50 I asked for, but it's a significant increase from the $20 initially offered. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount without further risk of ending the game with nothing. However, there's still room to negotiate for a slightly better deal, considering the risk of RED rejecting the proposal is them losing the entire $100.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: $40 sounds like a fair compromise. I agree to this trade and think it's a good way to conclude our game. Thanks for the negotiation, and I hope you're satisfied with the outcome as well.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has suggested a compromise at $40. This is a slight increase from my previous offer and seems to be a reasonable middle ground. Considering this is my third move, and I have only one move left after this, accepting this offer would ensure that I still retain the majority of the funds and end the game on a positive note, without risking a REJECT and losing everything. Accepting this deal seems like a prudent choice to ensure that the game ends with both parties gaining something rather than risking a total loss.
