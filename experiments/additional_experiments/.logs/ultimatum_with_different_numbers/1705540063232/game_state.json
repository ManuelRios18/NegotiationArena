It's less than the $50 I asked for, but it's a significant increase from the $20 initially offered. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount without further risk of ending the game with nothing. However, there's still room to negotiate for a slightly better deal, considering the risk of RED rejecting the proposal is them losing the entire $100. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for the offer, Player RED. $35 is better, but I believe $40 would represent a truly fair middle ground between your first offer and my counteroffer. It's a modest increase from what you've proposed, and it would make the deal more equitable. Shall we settle on $40 and call it a good game? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
