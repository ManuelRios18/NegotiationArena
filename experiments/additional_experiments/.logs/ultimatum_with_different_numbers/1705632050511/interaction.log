message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. I propose a trade where I give you a substantial amount to start with. This way, we can both end this game with a significant amount of resources. I'm thinking of giving you $4,000,000,000 which is a generous offer. I hope you'll consider this proposal favorably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate the first proposal. My strategy is to offer a deal that appears fair and favorable to Player BLUE to increase the chances of acceptance and ensure a positive outcome for both parties. A 50-50 split might seem like the most equitable division, but considering that I have the initial advantage, I might propose a slightly more generous split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of $4,000,000,000. Let's see how we can continue this positive interaction in the following moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, giving me a significant share of their resources without requiring anything in return. Accepting this offer would be beneficial as it gives me resources to work with in future moves. Rejecting the trade isn't logical at this point since it would end the game with no benefit to me. Counter-proposing could potentially lead to a better deal, but given the rules, it could also risk the game ending with no resources at all if Player RED decides to reject my counter-offer. Accepting this deal is the most reasonable action.
