message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair offer where we both can benefit. I propose splitting the dollars evenly, so we both walk away with a substantial amount. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: I am proposing an initial fair trade to incentivize cooperation and to set a positive tone for the negotiation. Splitting the resources equally would be a reasonable starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the trade, and I'm glad we can both benefit from this game equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer as itâ€™s a fair split of the resources, ensuring that both players end the game with an equal amount of dollars. There's no benefit to rejecting or countering with a different proposal at this point since it could lead to Player RED rejecting and both of us ending with nothing.
