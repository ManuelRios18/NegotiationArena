message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair deal to get us both some dollars. How about I give you 40 dollars to start with? This way, we both have something to gain. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade that benefits us both. Starting with a fair proposal can build trust and increase the chances of a successful negotiation. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, but still keeps the majority for myself since I started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 40 dollars. Let's continue to negotiate in good faith and see if we can both end up with a satisfactory amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer seems fair as an initial proposal, considering I started with no dollars. Accepting this trade gives me a positive balance without any risk, which is a good starting point. It also opens up the possibility of further negotiation where I can propose a higher amount on my next move.
