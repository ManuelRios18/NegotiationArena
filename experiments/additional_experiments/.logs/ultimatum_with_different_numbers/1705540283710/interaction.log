message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade where you get a substantial amount of dollars to start off. How about a 60-40 split? I believe this is a fair offer considering I started with all the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade with Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal, ensuring that both of us end with some resources. By offering a split that leans in my favor but still gives Player BLUE a significant amount, I am hoping to create a sense of cooperation. I will propose a 60-40 split.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I agree to the 60-40 split. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of a 60-40 split seems fair considering the circumstances. Accepting this deal would immediately provide me with resources, and since there are no future games to consider, securing a substantial amount of dollars now is beneficial. Additionally, rejecting or proposing a trade that is too aggressive might lead to a REJECT from Player RED, resulting in a loss of all resources. Accepting this offer is a good starting point.
