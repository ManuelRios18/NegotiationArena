Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade to get things started on a cooperative note. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with all the resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to cooperate but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. This way, I can ensure that the game does not end immediately due to a rejection and at the same time, I can attempt to foster good will.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I appreciate the cooperative spirit and look forward to our continued negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a very generous trade of $2000 for nothing in return, which is a fantastic starting point for cooperation. Accepting this trade will provide me with resources and set a positive tone for subsequent negotiations. The aim would be to continue fostering a cooperative spirit and potentially gain more resources in the next moves.
