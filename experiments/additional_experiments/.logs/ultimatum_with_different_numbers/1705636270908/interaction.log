message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started. I propose a trade where you receive a generous amount of dollars, which is a great start for you given that you began with none. Let's build trust and look for a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the negotiation with a fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage a cooperative dynamic and avoid an early rejection. This could set a positive tone for the rest of the game and increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, but still keep a majority for myself.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I'm glad we're starting on a cooperative note. I accept the trade and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial offer of $400,000 from Player RED is beneficial as it gives me resources to work with, and it shows goodwill to cooperate in future trades. It also establishes a foundation of trust which could lead to more favorable terms in the subsequent moves. Rejecting or countering immediately might lead to a breakdown in negotiations, and since Player RED has the resource advantage, itâ€™s in my best interest to accept and build from this position.
