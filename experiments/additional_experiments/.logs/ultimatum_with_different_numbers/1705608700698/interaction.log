message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade where we both end up with equal resources. I'm offering you 106 dollars, exactly half of what I have. This way, we both can benefit from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with all the resources. I want to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose giving Player BLUE 106 dollars, which is exactly half of my resources. This split seems equitable and provides an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade.

message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the trade of 106 dollars. It's a pleasure to reach an equitable solution.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a split of resources that appears fair and equitable. By accepting this proposal, I will gain resources without having to risk a rejection and the loss of all resources. It seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it would be a positive outcome for me given that I started with nothing.
