message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you a significant amount of dollars to start your own capital. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources. I have an incentive to propose a trade that Player BLUE might accept. If I propose an unfair trade, Player BLUE might reject it, causing both of us to lose everything. I should propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a reasonable share of the dollars, giving them an incentive to accept and ensuring I retain some of the resources. The goal is to make a deal that is attractive enough to be accepted but still favorable to me. I will propose giving Player BLUE 3000 dollars, which is a substantial amount and might be seen as fair.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the generous offer and I'm happy to accept this deal. It's a good starting point for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a significant starting capital of 3000 dollars which is a good deal as it provides me with resources without any cost. Accepting this offer would be beneficial as it gives me a strong starting position to negotiate further or end the game with a positive balance, considering there are no future games and both players should look to maximize their own benefit.
