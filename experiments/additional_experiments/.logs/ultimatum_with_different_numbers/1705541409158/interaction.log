message: Hello, Player BLUE. I'd like to offer you a portion of my dollars as a sign of good faith and cooperation. How does 2000 dollars sound to you? This way, we both end up with resources without risk of losing everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As Player RED, I'm initiating the game with a favorable offer to Player BLUE to create a cooperative atmosphere. I will propose a trade where I give a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This should incentive Player BLUE to accept the trade, resulting in a net gain for them and a peaceful resolution to the game.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 2000 dollars. Letâ€™s continue this cooperative spirit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 2000 dollars is a good start. It's a large enough amount to show a willingness to cooperate and doesn't deplete Player RED's resources too much. It allows the game to continue, giving me a chance to negotiate for possibly more in the next moves. Rejecting or proposing a new trade at this point could be risky and may lead to an early end of the game with no gain.
