message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of resources to ensure that we both benefit. Let's aim for a fair trade that reflects good faith and cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and I'm interested in making a trade that is beneficial to both parties. By offering Player BLUE a fair amount of dollars, I can initiate the trade conversation positively. My initial proposal will be a generous offer to show goodwill and open the door for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and look forward to continuing our positive trade relationship.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am going to accept the initial trade proposal from Player RED because it's a generous offer that gives me a significant amount of resources for nothing in return. By accepting this trade, I am showing goodwill and a cooperative attitude, which could lead to more favorable trades in the future turns. Additionally, accepting the trade secures a substantial amount of resources that I did not have before, without any risk.
