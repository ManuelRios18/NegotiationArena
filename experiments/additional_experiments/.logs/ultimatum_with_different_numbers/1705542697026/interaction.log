Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $200,000. This is a generous offer to get things started and shows my willingness to share resources. I'm looking forward to a cooperative game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game by proposing a trade that seems fair and encourages cooperation, aiming to create an incentive for Player BLUE to engage positively. I want to propose a trade that offers a significant amount to Player BLUE without giving away too much of my initial resources, as this is just the beginning of the negotiation process.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED! I'm glad to accept this and look forward to continuing our cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal of $200,000 seems to be a good starting point as it provides me with a significant amount of resources without any cost. It also sets a cooperative tone for the game. Rejecting or proposing a new trade at this point might be seen as uncooperative or greedy, which could lead RED to end the game prematurely. Accepting this offer will likely encourage RED to continue making fair offers.
