Given that negotiations are about give and take, it might be reasonable to accept this offer or propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to increase the share. However, considering the risk of rejection and loss of all resources, it might be safer to accept a reasonable offer now. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for considering a more equitable trade. While I'm inclined to ask for a bit more to reflect an even fairer split, I also recognize the risk of pushing too far and ending up with nothing for both of us. I propose a slight increase, and if that's acceptable, we can conclude our negotiation successfully. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
