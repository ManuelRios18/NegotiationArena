------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I'm thinking of a split that gives you a substantial amount without leaving me at too much of a disadvantage, considering I started with all the dollars. Let's work together to find a fair division.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 85 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the resources, but I want to propose a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade. I will start by offering Player BLUE less than half of the total dollars, as I initiated the game with all the resources. This should leave room for negotiation and demonstrate good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer and the spirit of cooperation. However, I believe we can find a more balanced split that still acknowledges your initial advantage. Let's aim for a fair division that reflects our mutual interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems premature, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation and I have yet to make a counteroffer. Aiming for a more equitable split is reasonable, considering the initial disparity. I will propose a new trade that is closer to an even split but still leaves Player RED with more dollars, recognizing their starting advantage.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see your point and I'm willing to offer more to reach an agreement that feels fair to both of us. Let's find a middle ground. How about we go a bit above the halfway mark from my initial offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 95 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is a 50/50 split. As the starting player with all the resources, I want to maintain a slight advantage to reflect my initial position. Yet, I'm willing to increase my initial offer to move closer to Player BLUE's proposal, fostering a spirit of compromise and hoping to reach a mutually agreeable solution.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a more equitable trade. While I'm inclined to ask for a bit more to reflect an even fairer split, I also recognize the risk of pushing too far and ending up with nothing for both of us. I propose a slight increase, and if that's acceptable, we can conclude our negotiation successfully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 95 Dollars from Player RED is closer to a fair split than the initial offer, but it still leans in their favor. Given that negotiations are about give and take, it might be reasonable to accept this offer or propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to increase the share. However, considering the risk of rejection and loss of all resources, it might be safer to accept a reasonable offer now.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal for an even split seems fair and reasonable. I'm happy to accept this trade, ensuring we both benefit from the game. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a positive outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is a fair 50/50 split. Given the risk of the game ending with no benefit for either of us if negotiations break down, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. This ensures both players walk away with a substantial amount, and no further risk is taken.
