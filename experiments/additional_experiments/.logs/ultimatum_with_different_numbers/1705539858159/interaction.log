message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a fair share, and it's a good starting point for us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to encourage cooperation and build trust with Player BLUE. I'll offer a split that gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars, enough to make accepting the trade appealing. This opening offer can be a 50-50 split, which is fair and might increase the likelihood of acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer by Player RED seems fair as it is an even split. Accepting this offer guarantees that I walk away with resources, which is better than potentially losing everything by pushing for more and risking a REJECT. I will accept this offer to ensure I gain something from this game.
