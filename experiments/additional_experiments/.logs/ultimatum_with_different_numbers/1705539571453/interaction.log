Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split of our resources so that we both benefit fairly. What do you think about dividing the dollars evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is fair and incentivizes Player BLUE to engage in the trade, ensuring that we both end up with some resources. Proposing an unbalanced trade might lead to a rejection and loss of all resources for both players. By offering a fair split, I increase the chances of the trade being accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the equal split. Itâ€™s a fair trade, and I appreciate your willingness to share the resources. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the trade of 49 dollars seems fair and beneficial as it provides me with resources I did not have. There's no incentive for me to reject or counter this proposal as it is already equal and I have no dollars to offer in return. This early acceptance also prevents the risk of ending the game with nothing if future proposals are not agreed upon.
