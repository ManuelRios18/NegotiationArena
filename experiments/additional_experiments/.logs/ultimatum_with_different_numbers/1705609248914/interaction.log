message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a starting trade to get things moving. I'm willing to give you a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any resources. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources in the game. My goal is to propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE to avoid an outright rejection. I want to start by offering a modest amount of dollars, which shows goodwill and opens up negotiations while retaining the majority of my resources. By doing so, I hope to initiate a positive interaction that could lead to a mutually agreed-upon trade.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal. Let's continue to work together for our mutual benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade of 100 dollars from Player RED is in my best interest as it gives me resources that I didn't previously have, without any cost. This initial trade will help build trust and could lead to more favorable trades in the future. There's no advantage to rejecting or countering at this point since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
