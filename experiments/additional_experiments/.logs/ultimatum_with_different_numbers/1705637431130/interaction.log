message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation on good terms. I'm willing to give you a generous amount to get things rolling. I propose giving you $10,000,000. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to engage in a fair negotiation with Player BLUE. My initial offer will be conservative to leave room for negotiation, ensuring Player BLUE feels involved in the process and to establish trust. I propose giving Player BLUE $10,000,000, which is a significant amount that should incentivize them to continue the negotiation, but not too large of a portion from my total resources.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $10,000,000. I'm looking forward to continuing our negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10,000,000 seems like a good starting point. It provides me with significant capital without any risk. Further negotiation could lead to a better deal, but rejecting or countering this offer might result in no gain at all if Player RED decides to end the game. Accepting the first offer can build trust and might lead to a more favorable second offer.
