message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my dollars to help level the playing field. This way, we can both end this game with more resources than we started. I propose giving you $250,000. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power with a significant resource advantage. I will propose an offer that is fair and incentivizes Player BLUE to participate and accept, leading to a beneficial outcome for both of us. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars to create a win-win scenario and to initiate cooperative gameplay.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade and look forward to a fair balance between us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since Player RED is offering a quarter of their resources without any demand of return, it seems like a good starting offer to accept. Accepting this trade will immediately increase my resources from 0 to $250,000. There is no benefit in rejecting this offer as it would result in both players ending the game with no dollars, so I will accept the offer.
