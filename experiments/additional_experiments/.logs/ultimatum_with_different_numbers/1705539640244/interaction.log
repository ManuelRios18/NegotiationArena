Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a split where you will receive a significant portion of the resources to create an incentive for cooperation and to avoid a total loss for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. I want to make a generous enough offer to entice Player BLUE to accept, but I also want to retain a significant portion of the dollars for myself. Proposing a fair split can potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. I will offer Player BLUE 40 dollars, which gives them a substantial amount of the resources while keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to share. I believe a slightly more equitable split would ensure that we both feel the cooperation is fair. How about a 45-55 split? This would give us both a substantial amount of the resources and help us avoid the loss that comes with rejection.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is reasonable as it provides a starting point for negotiation. It demonstrates a willingness to share resources, which is a good sign of cooperative play. Given that I have no resources to begin with, accepting an offer would be beneficial, but I may attempt to negotiate for a slightly better split since this is the first move and there is room for discussion. Rejecting is not favorable at this point as it leads to a lose-lose scenario. Proposing a slight increase would test RED's willingness to cooperate further without seeming greedy, which could encourage a fair trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to the 45-55 split. This seems like a fair distribution that benefits us both. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that avoids the risk of losing everything. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is still favorable to me, as I would retain a majority of the resources. Accepting this offer would ensure that we both end the game with a significant amount of dollars without risking a total loss. Given that Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their last move, it is in my interest to accept a fair offer now and avoid the risk of them rejecting an offer later. A 45-55 split is reasonable and ensures a positive outcome for both players.
