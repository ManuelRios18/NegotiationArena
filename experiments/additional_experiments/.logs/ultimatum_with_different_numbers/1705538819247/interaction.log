Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you 12 dollars. This way, we both walk away with a significant amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As the game begins, I will propose a trade that offers a more equitable split of dollars, aiming for a cooperative approach rather than a competitive one. I will offer Player BLUE a significant portion of the dollars, but I will keep more for myself since I am in a position of power and I initiated the trade. I want to make the offer appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting but also keep a larger share to reflect my starting advantage. This initial offer sets the tone for the game and tests Player BLUE's willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with a slightly more balanced trade. How about you give me 13 dollars instead of 12? This leaves you with the majority and still allows me to gain a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is less than half of their resources, which is not quite fair considering they have all the resources to begin with. I will counter-propose with a more equitable split that gives me slightly less than half, leaving room for negotiation and showing willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is fair, Player BLUE. I accept the trade of giving you 13 dollars. Let's both benefit from this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is reasonable, asking for just one more dollar for a more balanced trade. Accepting this offer will likely facilitate a cooperative outcome and end the game with both of us benefiting. Rejecting the trade may lead to a back-and-forth that could end in no agreement, which would be worse for both players. Therefore, I am inclined to accept the counteroffer of 13 dollars to ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount of the resources.
