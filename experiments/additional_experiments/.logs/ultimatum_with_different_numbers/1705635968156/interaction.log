message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to start things off. I suggest we split the dollars evenly, giving us both a good amount of resources. This is just an opening proposal and I'm open to hearing your thoughts or counter-proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: I want to propose an initial fair trade to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds. A 50/50 split is a rational starting point, as it gives both of us equal standing and shows goodwill. This can be adjusted based on Player BLUE's counter-offers.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. An even split is a fair starting point. However, considering the circumstances, I would like to propose a slightly different split. Since you're in the position to propose trades and I'm not, I think a 60/40 split in my favor would account for that advantage. If you find that acceptable, it would ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount of dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 600000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opening proposal by Player RED is quite generous, offering an even split. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it establishes a cooperative tone. Accepting this trade would ensure that I gain a significant amount of dollars without any risk. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal, leveraging the fact that if I reject, Player RED also loses everything. I need to be cautious not to push too hard, as a REJECT ends the game with no benefit to either player.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective. However, I'd like to propose a compromise that still benefits us both. How about a 55/45 split in your favor? This way, we both walk away with a significant share, and the slight advantage I have in proposing trades is accounted for.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 550000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer asking for a 60/40 split. While their reasoning is noted, it is also important for me to maintain a favorable position. I will counter with a slight adjustment to the initial 50/50 offer, showing willingness to negotiate but not giving away too much advantage. A 55/45 split is still generous and allows me to retain a slightly larger share of the dollars, which is fair considering I am initiating the trades.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 55/45 split in my favor. This seems like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the ability to propose trades. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a significant share of the dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counter to the counter-offer is a 55/45 split. This is a reasonable compromise, giving me the advantage while still keeping the split relatively even. This proposed split accounts for Player RED's ability to propose trades and gives me a better position than the initial 50/50 offer. It would be wise to accept this offer, as further negotiation might lead to diminishing returns or a breakdown in cooperation, resulting in a REJECT and no gain for either of us.
