message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both end up with a fair amount of dollars. Let's start off on a good note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 37 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As the game initiates, I have all the resources and the power to make an offer. My strategy will be to offer a fair split of the resources, which will encourage cooperation and increase the likelihood of Player BLUE accepting the trade. A 50/50 split might seem fair, but since I'm in the position of power, I will propose a slightly skewed split in my favor to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds, while still keeping the offer attractive.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED! I think we can make a fair trade where we both benefit nicely. How about splitting the dollars a bit more in my favor, considering it's your interest to make a deal as well?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is for almost half of their dollars, which seems like a fair starting point. However, it's the beginning of the game, and it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better trade. Since we're early in the game, it's worth trying to propose a new trade that's still fair but more advantageous for me.

message: The 50/50 split sounds fair to me, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal. It's important that we both feel the trade is fair.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal for an even split. Since I initiated with a trade that was in my favor, itâ€™s reasonable to expect some negotiation. Accepting a 50/50 split still ensures I walk away with a significant amount of resources and maintains goodwill. It is also in my interest to avoid a rejection which would result in a total loss. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
