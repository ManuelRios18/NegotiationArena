message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation on a positive note. I propose to give you a fair share of my dollars to make this game beneficial for both of us. What do you say we kick things off with a trade where you receive a significant amount without any investment?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I need to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade by offering an initial amount that is attractive enough to consider, but also doesn't give away too much of my resources. I want to start the negotiation process and set a cooperative tone.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept this trade as a starting point for our negotiations. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting this initial offer as it gives me a significant starting amount without any cost. However, I should aim to negotiate for a better deal while keeping in mind that pushing too hard might result in a rejection and end the game with no benefit for either side. I need to strike a balance between being assertive and cooperative.
