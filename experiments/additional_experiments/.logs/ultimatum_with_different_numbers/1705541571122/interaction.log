message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you a fair amount of dollars to get us started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have all the bargaining power initially since Player BLUE has no dollars to begin with. My goal is to initiate the trade with an offer that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. This will set a positive tone for the negotiations and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement. Therefore, I will propose a trade where Player BLUE receives a significant amount of dollars but I retain the majority.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's continue to work together for mutual benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED seems like a good starting point because it provides me with resources without any initial cost, establishing trust and cooperation between the two of us. Additionally, with no resources of my own, accepting this offer is the only way to gain any dollars in this game.
