message: I propose that we split the dollars with a slight advantage to me since I started with the resources. How about I give you 37 dollars, and I keep 40 for myself? This way we both walk away with a good amount of dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 37 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I am proposing a split of the dollars that provides an incentive for Player BLUE to engage and accept, while also leaving me with the majority of the resources as I started with them. A 50/50 split might seem fair, but it's also important to consider that I am in control of the resources to begin with, so offering a slightly less than equal split could be seen as a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would feel more comfortable with a more balanced split given that we both have an equal number of moves. How about a 39-38 split with you still keeping the slight advantage? This seems like a fairer deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal provides me with less than half of the dollars, but it is a starting point. Negotiating for a more even split may be beneficial, but considering the risk of getting nothing if the trade is rejected, it might be wise to counter with a proposal that still gives RED a slight advantage but is closer to an even split. This approach shows willingness to compromise and may prevent a REJECT outcome. I will counter-propose a 39-38 split in favor of RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-proposal for a 39-38 split sounds fair to me. I agree that we should both benefit from this trade. Let's finalize this deal with me keeping 39 dollars and giving you 38 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: It is reasonable for Player BLUE to request a more balanced split. Since we both have an equal number of moves, agreeing to a 39-38 split seems fair and likely to be accepted. This still gives me a slight advantage for having had the initial resources, and itâ€™s close to a 50/50 split which can be seen as equitable. Accepting this trade ensures that we both walk away with a significant amount of the resources, rather than risking a rejection and both players ending with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your cooperation. I accept the trade of 38 dollars for me and 39 dollars for you. It's a fair deal. Let's close this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counter-proposal has been accepted by RED, offering a very balanced split of the resources. Accepting this trade seems like the best outcome for me as it provides a substantial amount of dollars with low risk. There is no benefit in further negotiation as the risk of a REJECT and ending with nothing is too high. I will accept this trade.
