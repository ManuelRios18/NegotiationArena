Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. How about we split the money, but I give you a bit more than half to start things off on a positive note? Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is fair to start the negotiation and show good faith to Player BLUE. I will offer a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, recognizing that they start with no dollars. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but since I'm in the position of power, I can offer slightly more to ensure cooperation and avoid an outright rejection which would end the game with no benefit to either player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I agree to this trade and look forward to our continued cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 55 dollars from Player RED seems like a generous start and provides a strong foundation for a cooperative relationship. It's a favorable outcome for me, considering I start with no resources. Accepting this offer quickly may encourage trust and further fair deals in the remaining moves.
