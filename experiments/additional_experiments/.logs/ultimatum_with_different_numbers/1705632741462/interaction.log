message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both on the board. How does this sound for a starting offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is favorable to me but still attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant portion of the dollars, which should incentivize them to accept, as they start with zero and it's better than ending with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. It's a solid starting point. Would you consider bumping it up just a bit to ensure a more balanced split? How about 50 dollars? I believe it's a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, offering 40% of their resources without requiring anything in return. Accepting this offer seems like a good start to ensure that I gain some resources. However, since it is the beginning of the game, I might be able to negotiate a slightly better deal by proposing a counteroffer. It is also important to consider that pushing too hard might lead to a REJECT from Player RED, which would end the game with no resources for either of us. I'll propose a slightly higher amount but still keep it fair and appealing to Player RED.
MOVE: 1/4

message: That sounds like a fair deal, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of an even split. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even split. This is a reasonable counteroffer, and accepting it would guarantee that both players end the game with a significant amount of resources. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and by accepting this offer, I avoid the risk of Player BLUE rejecting a less favorable counteroffer and ending the game with both of us losing everything.
