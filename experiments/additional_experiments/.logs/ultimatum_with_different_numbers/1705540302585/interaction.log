Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm interested in making a deal that benefits us both. I'm offering you $20 to start things off. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game by proposing a trade that is skewed in my favor but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to engage. The goal is to create a starting point for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE will counter with a more balanced offer. I'm proposing to give 20 dollars as an opening offer, which shows willingness to trade but still leaves room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the $20 and look forward to further collaboration.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $20 sets a positive tone for cooperation and gives me a resource base to work with in future negotiations. It's a low-risk move that benefits me, and since I start with no dollars, I have nothing to lose by accepting this first trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4
