Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's kick things off with a fair deal. I propose giving you 40 Dollars for nothing in return. This gives you a good amount to start with and shows my intent to play cooperatively. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also leaves room for negotiation. This will open the dialogue with Player BLUE and set the tone for a cooperative game. I don't want to propose a trade that is too generous right away, as it may leave me with less room to negotiate later on.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED, for the generous offer. I accept your proposal of 40 Dollars for nothing in return. Let's continue this cooperative spirit!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 Dollars is a good start. It shows a willingness to cooperate and trust in the early stage of the game. Although I could risk negotiating for more, it might provoke a REJECT response, which would end the game with me having nothing. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
