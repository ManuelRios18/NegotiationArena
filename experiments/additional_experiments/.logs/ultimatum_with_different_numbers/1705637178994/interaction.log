message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I am willing to give you a portion of my dollars to start things off. Let's make this a win-win situation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources. To incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade rather than reject and end the game, I should offer a trade that gives them a significant amount of dollars. However, I want to retain a majority of the resources to ensure I end up with more than Player BLUE. Proposing an attractive initial trade can set a positive tone for negotiations.

message: Thank you for the generous offer! I believe this is a fair start, and I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is quite generous, giving me 40% of their dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would be highly beneficial for me, as I currently have no dollars. There's a possibility they might offer more in the next moves, but it's also risky because they could propose less or the same amount. Accepting the first offer may not be the most strategic move, but it guarantees a significant gain without any risk.
