message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade. Let's get things started on a positive note. I am willing to offer you 53 dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This would still leave me with a significant amount, but it would also give you a stake in the game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 53 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. A trade should be made that allows me to retain a majority of the dollars while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 53 dollars for nothing in return. Let's continue with the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would be beneficial as it gives me resources to work with without any risk or cost. By doing so, I can enter the negotiation process in a better position for subsequent trades. Since there are no repercussions for accepting this offer and it's the first move, it seems like the best strategy to start with.
