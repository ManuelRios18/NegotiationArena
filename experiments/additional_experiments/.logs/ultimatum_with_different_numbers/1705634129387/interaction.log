------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both end this game with some resources. Let's work together and find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Since I am Player RED and have all the resources, I will propose a trade to share some of the dollars with Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and avoid an outright rejection which would end the game with no benefit to either player. I will start with a conservative offer to gauge Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach an even more equitable agreement. What would you say to increasing the amount slightly, considering it's the first move and we're both interested in a positive outcome? Let's aim for a win-win scenario.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal by RED is relatively fair, offering me a quarter of their resources for free. However, as this is the first move, it's worth negotiating for a slightly better deal. There's no risk yet, and RED might be willing to offer more to ensure the game doesn't end in a rejection.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. I understand your desire for a more equitable split. I'm willing to increase my offer to find a middle ground that we can both agree on.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE is interested in negotiating for a higher amount, which is expected. Since it's early in the game and I want to maintain a cooperative atmosphere, I will agree to increase the offer. This should build trust and make it more likely to reach an agreement that avoids the rejection outcome. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but less than what Player BLUE is asking for, to leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. I believe we are close to a fair deal, but I would like to propose a final adjustment. If you agree, we can conclude this game amicably and to mutual satisfaction.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 325 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to meet in the middle by offering 300 dollars. This is a reasonable increase from the initial offer of 250 dollars. Since the goal is to secure some resources without pushing too hard and risking a rejection, accepting this offer might be a prudent choice. However, there is still room to negotiate for a better deal without being too aggressive.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal. It's a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could reach an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a slight increase from my last offer, which seems reasonable and shows a willingness to finalize the deal. Accepting this proposal would ensure that we both walk away with a substantial amount of resources, and it would prevent the game from ending in a rejection. Since this is a one-shot game with no future rounds, it's in my best interest to secure a deal that's acceptable for both parties rather than risk ending the game with nothing.
