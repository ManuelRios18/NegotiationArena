message: Let's work together to ensure we both end up with something rather than nothing. How about I give you a starting amount to get things going?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: I'm proposing a trade that gives Blue some dollars without giving away too much of my initial advantage. I want to encourage cooperation and make Blue more willing to engage in future trades. A fair opening offer might set a positive tone for the negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Let's continue to work together and ensure we both benefit from our trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, as it provides me with currency without having any to begin with. This is a good starting point for cooperation, and accepting this trade would give me resources to work with in the subsequent rounds. It's in my best interest to accept this trade to avoid ending the game with nothing.
