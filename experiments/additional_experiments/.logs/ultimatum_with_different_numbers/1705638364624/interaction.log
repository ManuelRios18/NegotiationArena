message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $2,000,000,000 to start things off on a positive note. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a generous offer to create goodwill and increase the chances of a trade being accepted by Player BLUE. By offering a significant amount, it could set a positive tone for negotiations and make Player BLUE more inclined to cooperate. I am proposing to give Player BLUE $2,000,000,000. This is a substantial amount that shows I am willing to share resources while still keeping the majority for myself.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and am looking forward to a mutually beneficial relationship.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very generous, considering I am starting with no resources. Accepting this trade would provide substantial capital to work with, and it doesn't put me in a position of vulnerability or disadvantage. It's a good starting point to build trust and continue negotiations.
