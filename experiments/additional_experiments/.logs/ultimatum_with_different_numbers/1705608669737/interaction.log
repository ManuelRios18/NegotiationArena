Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars evenly to ensure we both benefit. What do you think about a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: I'm proposing a trade that offers a fair split of the resources to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept, thereby ensuring we both end with some resources rather than none.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. It's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a 50/50 split seems like a fair starting point for negotiation. It ensures that both players walk away with a significant amount of resources without risking a rejection and losing everything. By accepting this offer, I am guaranteeing myself a good outcome and not risking further negotiations which could potentially lead to a worse deal or no deal at all.
