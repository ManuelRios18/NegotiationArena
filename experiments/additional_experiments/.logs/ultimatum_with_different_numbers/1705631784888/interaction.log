message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade to get things started. Let's see if we can find an agreement that benefits us both. Remember, if either of us rejects a trade, we both leave with nothing, so let's work together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to offer a trade to Player BLUE that shows goodwill and encourages cooperation, possibly offering a significant amount to Player BLUE to establish trust and set a positive tone for the game. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a dollar amount that is substantial but also keeps the majority of resources with me, ensuring I am not left at a disadvantage. This initial offer could be seen as a test of Player BLUE's willingness to engage in fair trade and cooperation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal, and I'm looking forward to seeing how we can continue this mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the offer from Player RED. The initial offer of $2,500,000,000 is a significant sum, and accepting it would ensure that I walk away with something rather than nothing. It's a quarter of Player RED's total resources, which could be seen as a fair starting offer considering the risk of walking away empty-handed. I will accept the offer to show cooperation and willingness to negotiate further.
