Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a good note. I propose that we split the dollars fairly. How about I give you $38 to make it a win-win situation for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: As the game begins, I want to propose an initial fair split of the resources to encourage cooperation and a positive response from Player BLUE. By offering nearly half of my resources, I aim to show goodwill and set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $38 seems fair as it's a straight split down the middle, and it guarantees that we both walk away with a substantial amount of the resource without risking a reject and leaving with nothing.
MOVE: 1/4
