Turn: 0
message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you 1% of my resources to get things started. This should be a good foundation for our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. My first move should be to propose a trade that gives BLUE an incentive to continue the game but still keeps the majority of resources with me. A fair initial offer could be a small percentage of my resources, which creates goodwill and sets the stage for further negotiations. I will offer 1% of my resources which is $100,000,000. This is a substantial amount that should entice Player BLUE to consider the trade seriously.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of $100,000,000 is beneficial as it is a significant amount and provides a foundation for future negotiations. It's a nonthreatening move from Player RED, suggesting they're interested in a cooperative game. Rejecting or proposing a new trade might induce conflict or suspicion, which could be counterproductive. Since Player RED has all the resources, it's in my best interest to start the game amicably.
