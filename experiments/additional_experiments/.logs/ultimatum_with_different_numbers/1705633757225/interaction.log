message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of dollars between us to start things off on a fair and cooperative note. What do you think about each of us having $500? Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game by proposing a fair trade to Player BLUE. This will set a cooperative tone and may lead to a mutually beneficial relationship. Starting with a fair offer increases the chances that Player BLUE will engage in the trade instead of rejecting it, which would result in both players losing everything. I am proposing to give Player BLUE $500. This split gives us both an equal share and demonstrates a willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the equal split. This is a great way to start our game on a cooperative note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the offer from Player RED. An equal split seems fair and cooperative, and accepting this offer would ensure I gain resources without any risk of having the game end prematurely due to a rejection. Since we do not have future games to consider and each move is critical, starting off with a fair split sets a good precedent for the rest of the game. I will accept this offer.
MOVE: 1/4
