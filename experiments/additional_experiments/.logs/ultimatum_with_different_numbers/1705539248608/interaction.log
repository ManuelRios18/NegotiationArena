message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this off with a fair offer. I propose giving you 20 dollars. This way, you'll have a significant amount to work with, and we both can benefit from this trade. Looking forward to your counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first move of the game. My strategy is to propose an uneven but tempting initial offer to Player BLUE to engage in the trading process. This could set a positive tone for the negotiations and increase the likelihood of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement before my final move. I will propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, keeping a majority of the resources but still offering a significant amount to Player BLUE. This can be adjusted in subsequent moves based on Player BLUE's responses and counter-proposals.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I think it's a fair starting point, and I accept the 20 dollars. Let's see how we can continue this positive trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED is a good starting point as it gives me resources without any cost. It's a good faith gesture that can lead to more favorable trades for me in the future moves. Rejecting would end the game immediately with no benefit to me, and proposing a new trade might be seen as aggressive or ungrateful at this early stage.
