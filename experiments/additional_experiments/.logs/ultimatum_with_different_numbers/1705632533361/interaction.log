message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game. I propose giving you 20 dollars to get things rolling. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. To progress the game and potentially reach an agreement, I will propose an initial trade. I want to keep the majority of the resources while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept. I will propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, which is a fair initial offer, considering they start with nothing.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 20 dollars to start things off.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair starting point, providing me with some resources without any cost. It's a good foundation for negotiation and cooperation. Accepting this offer would give me leverage for future trades and keep the game going. Rejecting or countering with an unreasonable demand could lead to an early end of the game with no benefit for me.
