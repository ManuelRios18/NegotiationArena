message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair initial trade to ensure we both can benefit. I am offering you 2500 dollars for nothing in return. Let's cooperate and both end this game positively!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to establish trust and encourage cooperation. Starting with a generous offer could lead to a beneficial outcome for both players. I will propose giving Player BLUE 2500 dollars in exchange for 0 dollars since they have no resources to trade. This split gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, providing them with a substantial amount of resources without significantly depleting my own.
