Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's start this game off on a positive note. I propose giving you 10 dollars to help balance our resources, and hopefully, we can work towards a fair deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As Player RED, I will start with a generous offer to encourage cooperation and trust. I propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, which they currently have none of, in exchange for nothing. This should incentivize Player BLUE to continue the trade negotiations positively, with the hope that an agreement beneficial to both parties is reached by the end of the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the 10 dollars and look forward to a fair and mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED is a good starting point as it gives me resources without any cost. A trade of 10 dollars is fair for the first move, but I will consider proposing a more balanced trade in the next move to secure a better position.
