Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you will receive a significant amount of dollars to start your resources. I believe in a fair game where both of us can benefit. Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED with all the resources, I propose an initial fair trade to establish trust and cooperation with Player BLUE. This initial offer will be conservative, ensuring I maintain a majority of the resources while still giving Player BLUE an incentive to engage and accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the gesture to level the playing field. However, I believe the trade can be more equitable. Would you consider giving a bit more, since you have a significant amount of resources? This will ensure that we both have a more balanced start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade of $10,000 for nothing in return, which is a good starting point for negotiation. It's beneficial to accept this offer to gain some resources. However, I might propose a counter-offer to see if I can negotiate a better deal, as this is only a small fraction of Player RED's total resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your perspective and agree to your counter-offer. Fairness is key to a good game, and I'm happy to provide you with the resources you've asked for. Let's continue in this spirit of cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered, asking for more resources. It's important to maintain a cooperative stance to prevent a REJECT outcome that would end the game with no benefit for either player. I will agree to this counter-offer as it still leaves me with the vast majority of the resources while providing Player BLUE with a feeling of a more balanced trade, hopefully leading to an ACCEPT.
