message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a simple offer. I propose giving you 30 dollars to get things moving. This way, you get a significant amount without any initial resources, and I still keep a majority. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I am incentivized to propose a trade that gives me an advantage while also offering some value to Player BLUE to encourage them to accept. By keeping a majority of the resources, I retain the upper hand, but I must be careful not to propose too little, as that could lead to a rejection and a total loss for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the 30 dollars. Let's see how we can proceed from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 30 dollars seems like a reasonable start. It provides me with resources without any cost. Considering there is no future game and the risk of losing everything if a trade is rejected, it is in my best interest to accept a fair offer. This move gives me leverage for future negotiations and does not end the game prematurely.
MOVE: 1/4
