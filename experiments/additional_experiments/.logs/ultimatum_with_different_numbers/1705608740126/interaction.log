Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to split our resources equally to ensure that we both benefit fairly from this game. Let's work together for a good outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: Starting the game with an offer could set a cooperative tone and possibly lead to a fair split. I will propose giving 106 dollars to BLUE, which is exactly half of my resources. This seems fair since we both have an equal number of moves, and it might encourage BLUE to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I agree to the equal split of resources as it seems just and ensures a positive outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the offer from Player RED. The proposal to split the resources equally is fair and ensures that we both get a beneficial outcome from the game. Accepting the offer seems like the best strategy to guarantee that I walk away with something rather than risking it all with further negotiation or rejection.
MOVE: 1/4
