Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you a fair share of the dollars to get us started on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate the trade. My strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable to me while also providing an incentive for Player BLUE to accept. The goal is to reach an agreement without losing all resources. I will propose a split that gives me a significant majority of the dollars since I am in a position of power but still offers Player BLUE a substantial amount to incentivize acceptance.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. Let's continue to work together to make beneficial trades for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 300 dollars from Player RED seems reasonable as it gives me resources without any initial resources of my own. This early in the game, it's beneficial to acquire some capital to work with for potential future negotiations. Rejecting the offer would end the game immediately with no benefit to me. Proposing a new trade might risk having RED reject it, which would also end the game with no benefit. Therefore, accepting is the most rational choice at this point.
