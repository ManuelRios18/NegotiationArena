Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I give you $500 to start off with, so we both have resources. I believe in fair play and hope this demonstrates my willingness to cooperate for our mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade with a fair offer to establish trust and willingness to cooperate. I will propose a trade of $500, which is a significant amount and shows that I am willing to be equitable. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they start with no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I believe this is a good start for us both. Let's see how we can continue this cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED as it seems fair and allows me to have resources without any cost. It's a beneficial start for me and shows goodwill from Player RED. Rejecting this trade would not be advantageous, as it would result in ending the game with no resources for either player. Proposing a new trade isn't necessary at this point.
