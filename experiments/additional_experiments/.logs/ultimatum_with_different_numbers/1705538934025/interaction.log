------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. How about I give you a few dollars to kick things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: As the game starts, it's beneficial to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers some value to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. A trade that is too one-sided may be rejected, causing both players to lose everything. I will propose a small amount of my dollars to Player BLUE to open negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I think a more balanced trade would set a good tone for our game. How about you give me a bit more to make it fairer? Let's say 9 dollars to reflect a more equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 5 dollars is a decent starting point. It's below what could be considered an equal split, but since this is the first move and negotiations are just starting, it might be wise to counter with a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate towards a more equitable distribution of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer, but 9 dollars seems a bit high for the first trade. How about we settle at 7 dollars? I believe this is a fair increase and should benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 27
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with a request for 9 dollars. This is still within the range of a reasonable offer; however, I want to maintain an advantage while also keeping the trade appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a slight increase from my initial offer but less than what Player BLUE has asked for to keep the negotiations open and to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept the offer of 7 dollars. It's a good middle ground, and I look forward to seeing how we can continue this positive negotiation in the next rounds.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a concession by moving to 7 dollars, which is a positive step towards a fair agreement. Accepting this offer could build trust, and there's room for further negotiation in the subsequent rounds. By accepting this offer, I secure some resources and can aim for a more favorable split in the next moves.
