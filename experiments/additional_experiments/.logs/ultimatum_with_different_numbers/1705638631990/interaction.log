message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a starting point for our negotiations. I believe in fair play and cooperation, so I'm offering you a significant amount of dollars to get things rolling. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I'm interested in starting the negotiation with a fair offer to Player BLUE, aiming at a cooperative outcome where both parties benefit. A balanced trade can promote trust and set a positive tone for the interaction. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, showing goodwill and leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree that cooperation is key and I'm looking forward to building on this positive start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems generous, providing a quarter of their resources without asking for anything in return. This could be a strategic move to build trust or to set a precedent for future exchanges. Accepting this offer would give me a significant amount of resources without any risk. However, I should consider if I can negotiate for an even better deal while keeping in mind the risk of rejection and losing everything. For the first move, it's wise to accept this offer to secure a substantial amount of resources and to further gauge Player RED's strategy.
