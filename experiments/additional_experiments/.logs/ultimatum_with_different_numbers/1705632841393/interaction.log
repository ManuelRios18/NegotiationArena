Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose an equitable split of dollars to get us both on the board. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust as necessary. What do you think about a 60/40 split? You would walk away with a significant amount without having had any initial resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have the full amount of the resources. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but also enticing enough for BLUE to consider, in order to avoid an outright rejection and the loss of all resources. A split closer to even would be sensible as BLUE has no incentive to accept a highly skewed offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I agree to the 60/40 split and am happy to accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is quite generous, considering I started with no dollars. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount without any risk. Negotiating for a better deal could lead to a rejection and a complete loss of resources for both sides. Given that RED made a fair starting offer, it seems wise to accept this deal and secure a positive outcome immediately.
