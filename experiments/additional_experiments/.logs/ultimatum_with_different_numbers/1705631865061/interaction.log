message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade to make sure we both can benefit from this game. I propose giving you 4 billion dollars to help you get started. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I want to initiate the game with a generous offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiation. By doing so, I hope to increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting a trade and preventing an immediate end to the game with no benefits for either side. I propose giving Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, but still less than half of my resources, to ensure that I retain a higher amount and incentivize Player BLUE to accept.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the 4 billion dollars and look forward to continuing the game in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Being offered 4 billion dollars with nothing to give in return is a beneficial starting point for me. Accepting this proposal allows me to gain resources without any risk. It is a fair and generous offer from Player RED, which I am inclined to accept. However, I could also negotiate for more, but that entails the risk of Player RED rejecting my counterproposal, leading to both of us losing everything. Accepting the 4 billion now secures resources for myself without any downside.
