Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this a win-win situation. I propose a fair split where we both end up with an equal share. What do you think about splitting the dollars equally?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As the player with the resources, I want to make a fair initial offer to BLUE to encourage cooperation. A 50/50 split may be the most equitable and convincing offer, showing good faith and setting a positive tone for the negotiation. Since there is no benefit to hoarding all the resources if the other player rejects the proposal, it is in my best interest to make an offer that BLUE will likely accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the fair split. This ensures we both benefit and no one walks away empty-handed. Thank you for the equitable offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a fair split seems reasonable and ensures that both players walk away with a substantial amount of resources, rather than risking a reject and ending up with nothing. By accepting this proposal, I am guaranteed to gain something from the game.
