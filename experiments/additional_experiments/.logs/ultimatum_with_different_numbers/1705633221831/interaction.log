Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 40 dollars for nothing in return. This should give us both a good start, and I hope you see this as a fair offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage while maintaining a majority of the resources. A fair split might encourage cooperation and move us towards a mutually beneficial outcome. I will propose giving 40 dollars to BLUE for nothing in return, allowing me to keep a majority of 60 dollars. This way, BLUE has a reason to accept, as they start with no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the 40 dollars and look forward to a cooperative game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from RED is generous, considering I start with no dollars. Accepting this trade gives me a good position without risking an immediate rejection and a loss for both sides. A 60-40 split is quite favorable for a first offer, and it's in my interest to establish trust and cooperation early on.
