message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to start us off. I believe in creating win-win situations, so I'm offering you a substantial amount to get things going. Let's work together and make the most out of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate trade. I will propose an equitable trade to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for negotiation. I'll offer Player BLUE a significant amount that could be appealing, but not so much that it diminishes my advantage too early in the game.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm pleased to accept this trade. Let's continue in this spirit of cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm accepting this initial offer because it's a significant amount and provides a strong starting position for negotiation. Accepting this trade doesn't preclude further negotiation to improve my position, and rejecting it would end the game immediately with no benefit to me.
