message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to share my resources with you for a fair and equal partnership. Let's both benefit from this game. I propose a 50-50 split. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal that might entice Player BLUE to engage in a trade. A 50-50 split is often perceived as fair in many negotiation scenarios, and although I am in a position of power with all the resources, offering an equal share upfront can build trust and may lead to a quick agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: I agree to the 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we can both benefit from this game. Thank you for your generous proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50-50 split is a beneficial and fair start for me since I start with no dollars. It ensures that I end the game with substantial resources, and there's a mutual benefit for both players without further risk.
