message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose a fair trade to ensure that both of us can walk away with a significant amount of dollars. How about I give you 106 dollars to even things out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having all the dollars. To start the negotiation in a positive way and to encourage cooperation, I will propose a trade that offers a fair split of my resources to Player BLUE. This should set a good tone and make it more likely for Player BLUE to accept a deal.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the trade of 106 dollars for nothing in return. Let's both walk away with a win!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal by RED is a 50-50 split of the resources, which seems fair and ensures that both players walk away with a substantial amount. Accepting this offer is reasonable as rejecting would result in both players losing everything, and proposing a new trade might lead to a less favorable outcome. I will accept this trade.
