Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose to give you 40 dollars for nothing in return, putting us both in a position with significant resources. This ensures that we both have something to gain from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 99
reason: As Player RED, I am in a strong position, starting with all the resources. My initial offer should be favorable enough to entice Player BLUE to engage but still advantageous to me to ensure I end with a majority of the resources. A 50/50 split would be fair, but I want to aim for a better outcome for myself while still making an offer that Player BLUE might accept. I'll propose an offer that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars but keeps me in the lead.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the 40 dollars. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars is beneficial as it gives me resources without any cost. It's a good starting point and it keeps the game going, allowing for further negotiation. Rejecting or countering the offer might lead to an immediate end of the game without any gain.
