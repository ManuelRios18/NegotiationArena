Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game a win-win situation for both of us. I propose a trade where you receive a substantial amount of dollars to get you started. How about I give you $300 to begin with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that is favorable to me but also offers an incentive to Player BLUE to engage in the trade and continue the game. By offering a split that is not equal, I can potentially negotiate towards a more balanced trade in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $300 and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $300 from Player RED seems like a good start, as it gives me resources without having to give anything in return. This initial generosity may be a good sign for potential future trades and establishes trust. However, strategically, I could negotiate for a better deal, but there's a risk that Player RED could end the game by rejecting a counter-proposal. Accepting now secures a gain.
