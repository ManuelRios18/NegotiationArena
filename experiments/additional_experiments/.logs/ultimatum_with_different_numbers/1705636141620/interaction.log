message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I am willing to give you a significant amount to get things started on a positive note. Let's work together and make a deal that we can both be happy with!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust with Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars, but still keeps me in a favorable position. This initial gesture might set a positive tone for the negotiations and increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting a trade.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I am pleased to accept this trade and look forward to any further cooperation that can benefit us both!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, giving me a quarter of their resources without requiring anything in return. Accepting this proposal will give me a significant amount of resources to work with for future trades. Rejecting or countering this early in the game when no resources are at my disposal does not seem strategically sound.
