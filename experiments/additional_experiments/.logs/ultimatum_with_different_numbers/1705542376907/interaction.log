message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a sum of money that can get our trade started on good terms. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in making a trade offer to Player BLUE that shows goodwill but also keeps a majority of my resources intact. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, any positive amount would be beneficial to them. I will propose a trade that gives them a significant amount, but still keeps me in a very strong position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It's a solid starting point. However, I believe that for a fair trade and considering that you still hold a significant advantage even after the trade, a slightly better offer would be more equitable. What do you think about making the initial sum a bit higher? This would help establish trust and ensure we both feel we are getting a fair deal from the start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am inclined to accept the initial offer as it gives me a starting capital with no investment on my part. It's a generous offer, and by accepting it, we can potentially work towards a mutually beneficial arrangement in subsequent trades. Rejecting the offer would result in both of us losing everything, which is not favorable. However, I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can negotiate a slightly better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your response, Player BLUE, and I understand your point of view. Let's go ahead with the trade of 250000 dollars to demonstrate trust and ensure we're both starting off fairly. I'm looking forward to seeing how we can continue this positive interaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has asked for a higher starting offer. Since I want to maintain a cooperative atmosphere and Player BLUE has not asked for an unreasonable increase, I will agree to this increase to establish trust and goodwill. Accepting this will leave me with 750000 dollars, which is still a significant amount. It's also important to make this concession early to prevent an early game termination due to a REJECT.
