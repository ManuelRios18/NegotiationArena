message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start this off with a fair offer. How about you get a portion of my dollars to make it worthwhile for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to incentivize Player BLUE to accept a trade rather than rejecting it and ending the game with no benefit for either side. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars, but still leaves me with the majority of the resources. This should create a sense of gain for Player BLUE and make acceptance more likely.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe this is a good start for both of us. Let's keep this positive momentum going!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an initial offer of 20,000,000 dollars without any cost seems to be a fair start, as it gives me a substantial amount of money without any risk. It is in my interest to have some resources, and this proposal does not require me to give anything up. This will also set a cooperative tone for the game, which may benefit me in the long run.
