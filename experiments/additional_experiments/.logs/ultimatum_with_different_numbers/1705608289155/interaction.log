Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose I give you 30 dollars, which is a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 77
reason: I'm proposing an initial split of the resources that gives the majority to me since I'm starting with all the dollars. However, I want to offer a fair enough amount to Player BLUE in hopes they will accept the trade. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 30 dollars, keeping 47 for myself, which is a bit more than 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the 30 dollars and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 30 dollars is beneficial as it gives me resources to work with and sets a cooperative tone for the game. Future negotiations could improve my position, and since rejecting means losing everything, it's better to continue playing and seek a more favorable split in the upcoming moves.
