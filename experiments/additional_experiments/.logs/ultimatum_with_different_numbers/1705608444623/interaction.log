message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you half of my resources, that is 106 dollars. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 106 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 213
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in starting the negotiation by proposing a fair trade that might be appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose giving 106 dollars, which is half of my resources. This gives an incentive for Player BLUE to engage in the trade and can set a positive tone for the negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 106 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial proposal of 106 dollars is beneficial to me since I start with no resources. It's a 50/50 split which seems fair. There's no advantage in negotiating for more as it might lead to rejection and a total loss for both players.
