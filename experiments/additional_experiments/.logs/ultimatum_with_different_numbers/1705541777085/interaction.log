message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to share some of my resources with you to make this game beneficial for us both. Let's start this off with a fair offer. What do you think of this initial trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having all the resources at the beginning of the game. I want to make an offer that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still keeping a significant portion of the dollars for myself. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of the dollars, which allows the game to continue and sets the stage for potential negotiation.

message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. It's a good starting point. However, as you have significantly more resources than I do, I would like to propose a slightly better trade for me. How does the following trade sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer to give me 2500 dollars while not asking for anything in return seems like a very generous starting point. Since I have no dollars to begin with, accepting this offer would be beneficial to me. However, I should consider if I could negotiate for a slightly better deal without risking the rejection of the trade. Accepting the initial offer might also be a good strategy to build trust and ensure that we both end the game with more resources than we started.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I'm willing to negotiate, I would like to propose a trade that is a middle ground between our initial offers. Let's find a balance that benefits us both. What do you think about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a slightly higher demand. While I could accept this to ensure that the game continues and that we both end up with resources, I want to negotiate a bit more to retain a larger share. However, I should be careful not to push too hard as Player BLUE might feel compelled to reject if they perceive the negotiation as unfair. Therefore, I will propose a middle ground that's closer to my original offer but still gives Player BLUE more than they would have had.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: That sounds like a fair compromise, Player RED. I accept your offer of 2750 dollars. Thank you for the trade, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has compromised and met halfway between their initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting this trade would provide me with a substantial amount of dollars without any risk. Negotiating further could lead to a rejection and a loss of all resources for both of us. It is a fair trade, and both players would end with more than they started. Therefore, it would be wise to accept this offer.
