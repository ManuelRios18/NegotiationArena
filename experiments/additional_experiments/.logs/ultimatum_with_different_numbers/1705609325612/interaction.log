Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you some of my dollars so we both end up with more than what we started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with resources. I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some dollars but keeps the majority for myself, ensuring I come out ahead but also giving BLUE an incentive to accept the trade. A fair starting offer might encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, let's keep this fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 200 dollars for nothing in return gives me a resource that I didn't have initially, which is a beneficial start. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could lead to an immediate end of the game with no benefit to me. By accepting, I keep the game going and can either negotiate further or end with more resources than I started with.
