message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $2,500,000,000. This is a substantial amount that can benefit you greatly. I hope this offer seems fair and that we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to initiate a trade. My goal is to propose a trade that seems fair and encourages cooperation, while also retaining a significant portion of my resources. By offering a reasonable amount, I aim to avoid immediate rejection and foster trust, potentially leading to more favorable terms in subsequent moves.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of $2,500,000,000. It's a great start for me, and I appreciate the opportunity to come to an agreement that is indeed beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $2,500,000,000 would be beneficial because it provides a significant amount of resources with no risk on my part. Since there are no future games and no other resources or conditions to consider, it seems wise to accept a quarter of Player RED's resources without the need to negotiate further. This ensures a positive outcome for me without the risk of ending the game with nothing due to a potential rejection.
