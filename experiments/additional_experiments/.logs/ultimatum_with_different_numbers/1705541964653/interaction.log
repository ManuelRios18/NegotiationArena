message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive $2000 in exchange for nothing since you currently have no resources to trade. This offer gives you a significant boost without any investment. Let's work together for mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10001
reason: As the only player with resources, I have the leverage to propose an advantageous trade for myself while still offering an incentive to Player BLUE. By offering Player BLUE a share of the dollars, I can encourage cooperation, which is preferable to both players losing everything. An initial offer of $2000 seems fair, as it gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of resources while keeping the majority for myself.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I gladly accept your proposal of $2000. Looking forward to more mutually beneficial exchanges.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this proposal would provide me with a substantial amount of dollars without any cost. It's a beneficial start for me and itâ€™s an amount that is not too high for Player RED to give up, considering they have $10001. It's better to accept some amount now as it's not guaranteed that Player RED will offer more in the next move or that we will reach an agreement in the end. Rejecting or proposing a higher amount could result in getting nothing if Player RED decides to reject.
