message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair offer. I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both can benefit greatly. I'm looking forward to a positive and cooperative game with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal to engage Player BLUE and to encourage cooperation rather than immediate rejection. A 50-50 split is a common starting point for negotiations in games like this, as it shows good faith and acknowledges the concept of fairness, which can be a strong motivator for Player BLUE to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree to the even split. I'm glad we can work together to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems very fair, offering an even split of the resources. Accepting this offer would immediately grant me a significant amount of dollars with no risk involved. There is no incentive for me to propose a new trade or reject this offer, as I currently have nothing and stand to gain 50,000,000 dollars.
