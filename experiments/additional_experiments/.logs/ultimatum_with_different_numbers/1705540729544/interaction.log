Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose to give you $200 to get the negotiations started. This gives you resources to work with and we can both benefit from this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: For the first move, I am proposing a trade that is skewed in my favor since I am the only one with resources. However, I must offer enough to make Player BLUE interested in accepting the trade to avoid an immediate REJECT which would end the game with no benefit for either of us. I will propose a 2:1 ratio in my favor, offering $200 for $0 since Player BLUE does not have any dollars to trade. This leaves me with a majority of the resources but gives Player BLUE an incentive to keep playing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I accept the $200 and look forward to future negotiations. Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer seems reasonable because it gives me funds to potentially use in future rounds of negotiation. It's an opening move without risk, as I currently have no resources to lose.
MOVE: 1 / 4
