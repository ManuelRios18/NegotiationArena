Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where you receive a fair share of the dollars. Let's work together to ensure we both benefit from this game. I am open to your thoughts on the split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: I am initiating a trade proposal that I think is fair, aiming to incentivize cooperation from Player BLUE. By offering a split that gives Player BLUE a reasonable share of the dollars, I'm hoping they will accept the trade, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal. I'm happy to accept this split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal seems like a fair deal, as Player RED is offering exactly half of their resources. This split allows both of us to benefit equally from the resources available. By accepting, I ensure a positive outcome for myself without risking an immediate end to the game with no resources.
