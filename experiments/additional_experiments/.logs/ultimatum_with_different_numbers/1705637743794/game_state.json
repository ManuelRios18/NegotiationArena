By accepting a counter-offer that gives Player BLUE a fair share, I am fostering a cooperative relationship and ensuring that the game ends positively for both parties. It is important to remember that if either player rejects a proposal, both lose everything, so it is in my best interest to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
