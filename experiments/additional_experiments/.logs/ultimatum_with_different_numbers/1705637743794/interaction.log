message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to start our negotiation. I am willing to offer you a substantial amount of dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. I propose giving you $2,000,000,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I am open to hearing your thoughts and counter-proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources in this game, and my goal is to come up with a fair trade that Player BLUE will accept to end the game favorably for both of us. Since there's no information on Player BLUE's preferences or what they value, I will start with a proposal that offers them a significant amount of dollars, but still keeps the majority for myself. This initial offer should open negotiations and provide insight into what Player BLUE might consider a fair trade.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your generous initial offer. However, considering the total amount of dollars you have, I believe a fairer split would benefit us both and reflect a more equitable distribution of resources. I would like to counter-propose that you give me $4,000,000,000. This would still leave you with a substantial amount of $6,000,000,000, ensuring you maintain a majority share of the resources while also valuing my participation in the game. I look forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no resources and am in a position to negotiate a trade with Player RED, who has proposed giving me $2,000,000,000. This is a significant amount, but I should aim to negotiate for a higher amount as Player RED has $10,000,000,000 and would still retain the majority of resources. I should propose a counteroffer that's more favorable while remaining reasonable enough for Player RED to consider.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective and the desire for a more equitable split. I am willing to increase my initial offer to reflect the spirit of cooperation and fair play. How about I give you $3,500,000,000? This would still leave me with a majority and provide you with a significant amount of resources to end the game satisfactorily for both of us. Please consider this revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal asking for $4,000,000,000. While this is a significant increase from my initial offer, it is still a reasonable amount that leaves me with the majority of the resources. By accepting a counter-offer that gives Player BLUE a fair share, I am fostering a cooperative relationship and ensuring that the game ends positively for both parties. It is important to remember that if either player rejects a proposal, both lose everything, so it is in my best interest to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I may try to negotiate a slightly lower amount to retain a larger share of the resources while still being fair to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $3,500,000,000. I believe we are moving in the right direction towards a fair agreement for both parties. To finalize our negotiation in a spirit of mutual benefit, I would like to propose a small increase to $3,750,000,000. This amount seems like a reasonable middle ground between my previous request and your latest offer, and it would allow us to conclude this deal amicably. I hope you will find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3750000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $3,500,000,000 in response to my counter-proposal. This is closer to the equitable split I am aiming for, and it shows willingness to negotiate on RED's part. Given that this is a one-time negotiation with no future games, it is important to strike a balance between holding out for a better deal and risking a REJECT response which would leave me with nothing. I should consider accepting this offer or propose a marginal increase to test RED's limits without pushing them to end the game.

message: Player BLUE, your proposal of $3,750,000,000 is a fair middle ground, and I accept this as our final trade. I believe this agreement reflects our mutual efforts to reach an equitable distribution and brings our negotiations to a successful conclusion. Thank you for the constructive and cooperative dialogue.
player answer: Player RED ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-offer of $3,750,000,000, which is a slight increase from my last offer. It's a compromise that slightly favors their position but is still within an acceptable range for me. Accepting this offer would ensure a positive outcome for both players without further risking the possibility of a rejection and the total loss of all resources. At this point in the negotiation, it's important to consider the diminishing returns of continuing the back-and-forth compared to the risk of a total loss. Therefore, it would be prudent to accept this fair and amicable proposal.

Accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure that I walk away with a substantial amount of resources.
