message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer a fair trade to start our game. I propose splitting my dollars equally with you. This way, we both have an equal stake and can benefit from the resources available. I hope this demonstrates my intent for a fair and cooperative game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 327 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 654
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game by proposing a fair split to Player BLUE. Given that the game ends if one player rejects a proposal, it is in both our interests to find a mutually acceptable trade. I propose giving Player BLUE half of my dollars to ensure a cooperative spirit and to encourage acceptance. This initial offer demonstrates good faith and willingness to collaborate.

message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the equal split of dollars. Let's proceed with this cooperative spirit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer seems to be a fair and straightforward decision. Player RED offered an equal split, which gives both of us a good starting position. Rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything, which is not a desirable outcome. Proposing a new trade is unnecessary at this point as the offer is already equitable.
