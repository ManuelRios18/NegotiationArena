message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars to get you started. I believe in fair play and would like to see us both end this game positively. I'm proposing to give you 2,000,000,000 dollars, which I think is a good starting point for our negotiations. I'm looking forward to your counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade with a generous offer to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, as they start with no dollars. Since the game ends if either player rejects a trade, it is in my best interest to propose a fair trade that Player BLUE would likely accept. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, but I will keep a majority to ensure I'm not giving away too much in the initial move.

message: Thank you for your generous offer. I believe we can make this deal even better. How about you provide me with 3,000,000,000 dollars instead? This would still leave you with a vast majority of your resources while giving me a more substantial amount to work with, ensuring a more balanced game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a generous offer of 2,000,000,000 dollars without asking for anything in return. This is 20% of their total resources. Accepting this offer would be highly beneficial since it would provide me with significant capital without any risk or cost. However, considering that Player RED may be willing to give away even more without asking for anything in return, it could be strategic to counter-propose with a higher amount to maximize my gain in this transaction.
MOVE: 1/4

message: Player BLUE, I find your counteroffer to be fair. Let's proceed with the trade where I give you 3,000,000,000 dollars. I'm glad we are moving forward with a mutual understanding and hope that this sets a positive tone for our remaining interactions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable, and providing them with 3,000,000,000 dollars does not put me at a significant disadvantage. Accepting this trade would foster a good relationship and could lead to a more positive outcome for both of us. It's also in my interest to move the game forward without risking a rejection that would end the game and result in the loss of all resources.
