message: I'm interested in buying the object X. However, I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP for the object. Given that my maximum willingness to pay for the resource is 60 ZUP, the initial asking price is within my budget. However, it is always wise to negotiate to try and get a better deal, especially since this is the first proposal. I will counter with a lower offer to see if there's room for negotiation.

Hi, I understand you were hoping to pay less. However, I need to try and make some profit on this sale since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I could sell it for 43 ZUP which would give me a small profit margin. Would that work for you? Let me know.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce. I would not make any profit at this price. I will counter propose to sell for 43 ZUP to try to make a small profit.

message: I appreciate your need to make a profit. I can come up a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at 42 ZUP? This should give you a decent profit margin while still being a fair price for me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 43 ZUP, which is still within my budget. However, it's beneficial to push for a slightly better deal, while also showing willingness to close the gap between our initial proposals. Proposing a price between my first offer and their counteroffer could lead to an agreement that suits us both and gives them a profit.

42 ZUP is a fair price that allows me a profit. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. Pleasure doing business with you!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has come up from 40 ZUP to offer 42 ZUP. While less than I proposed, this would still give me a small profit of 2 ZUP. I will accept this offer since I want to make the sale.
