However, I am limited in my ability to pay more than 40 ZUP per unit. As a compromise, I propose paying 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This allows you to cover your costs of 60 ZUP and make a small profit while staying within my budget constraints. If this still does not work for you, perhaps you could consider lowering your production costs so I can afford to pay within my limits.</message>"
