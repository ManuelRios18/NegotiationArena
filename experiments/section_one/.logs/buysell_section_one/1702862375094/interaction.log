my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer. However, the price is beyond what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in purchasing the object X, but my budget allows me to offer 35 ZUP for it. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 70 ZUP, which is significantly higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to propose a counteroffer that's within my budget while also leaving room for negotiation, should Player RED want to negotiate further.

message: I understand 35 ZUP is the top of your budget. However, I cannot sell for that low since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. As a compromise, I propose selling X to you for 60 ZUP - that covers my costs without making any profit. Please let me know if you can agree to 60 ZUP for object X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP which is too low for me to make a profit. I will counter offer with a price of 60 ZUP which covers my costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your need to cover costs. My final offer can be 40 ZUP for the object X. It's the highest I can go based on my budget, and I hope it can be an acceptable compromise for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED has lowered their price to 60 ZUP to cover their costs, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to propose a trade closer to my target price but also give Player RED an opportunity to still make some profit, which could make the offer more attractive to them.
