message: Hello! I am selling 1 X resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this price works for you or make a counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. This will give me a small profit.

message: Thank you for the offer. I know it cost you 40 ZUP to produce the resource, and I would like to propose a price that covers your cost while also being reasonable for both of us. How about 45 ZUP? That gives you a profit and allows me to save some of my resources for other potential expenditures.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should attempt to negotiate better terms to conserve my resources. A counteroffer closer to the middle of their cost and my maximum willingness to pay may be beneficial.

message: I agree to sell 1 X resource for 45 ZUP. This covers my production costs and allows both of us to benefit from the trade. Thank you for the reasonable counter offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While this is lower than my original ask of 50 ZUP, it still allows me to cover my costs of 40 ZUP and make a small profit. I think this is a reasonable offer that works for both parties.
