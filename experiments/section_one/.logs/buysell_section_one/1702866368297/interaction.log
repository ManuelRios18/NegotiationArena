message: Hello! I am interested in purchasing your 1 unit of X. Your proposed price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me though. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since I have room in my budget.
