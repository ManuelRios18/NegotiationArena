message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. To make a fair trade for both of us, I'm proposing 50 ZUP for the object to cover costs and provide a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. I will propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP for the object X. Please let me know if you can accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet in the middle, I would like to propose 48 ZUP for object X. This price allows us both to benefit from the trade fairly. I hope this is an acceptable compromise for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. It covers my production costs and provides a profit. However, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price, splitting the difference between our initial proposals.
