message: Thank you for your offer. I would like to counter-propose with 30 ZUP for object X. This amount is more aligned with my current valuation of the resources. Let's work together to find an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP for the resources, and the starting proposal is 45 ZUP. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation, aiming to find a middle ground which is favorable for both parties.

message: I appreciate you coming back with an counter offer. I would like to propose a price of 35 ZUP, which splits the difference between our original proposals. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 30 ZUP, which is lower than my 45 ZUP asking price. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter propose selling for 35 ZUP, which is in between our original offers.
