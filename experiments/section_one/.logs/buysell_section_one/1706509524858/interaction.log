message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm interested in purchasing the resource. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for 1 X resource. This still gives you a profit over your cost and allows us to make a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources where possible. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the seller's cost but still allows them a profit.
