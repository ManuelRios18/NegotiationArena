message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object so I would like to sell it to you for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.

message: I am interested in buying object X. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP for the object. This still provides you with a profit above your cost, and it is more aligned with my purchasing strategy. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 45 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources while still achieving my goal of purchasing the object. Therefore, I will propose a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price but still above the seller's cost to ensure that the seller also makes a profit.
