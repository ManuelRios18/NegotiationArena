message: Hi! Thanks for your offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay for the object X. However, I would like to propose a price of 42 ZUP. This should still give you a decent profit while staying within my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, but I will attempt to negotiate a better price to conserve my resources while ensuring a fair deal for both parties. I'll propose a slightly lower price than what they're asking, but still above their cost to show that I respect their need to profit.

I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the trade. Please let me know next steps to complete the transaction. Thank you!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has proposed 42 ZUP which is lower than my original ask of 45 ZUP. However, it still allows me to make a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I would like to accept this offer so I can make the sale.
