message: I understand your budget constraints, but I also need to make a profit on my investment. I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP as a compromise. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but I aim to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to try and reach a middle ground.
