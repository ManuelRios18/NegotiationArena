message: Hello, I am interested in buying 1 unit of X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling for 40 ZUP instead of 45? If not, please make a counteroffer and we can negotiate.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Hello, I understand your budget constraint, but I need to cover my costs and make a small profit. I paid 40 ZUP to produce this item, so I would be breaking even at 40 ZUP. Could you pay 47 ZUP instead? Let me know if that works for you, otherwise please counteroffer.  

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 40 ZUP, which is my breakeven cost. I would like to make some profit, so I will counteroffer 47 ZUP which is in between my ask and their offer.

message: I understand you need to cover your costs. I would be willing to meet in the middle at 45 ZUP. This allows you to have a small profit while staying within my budget. If that does not work for you, please let me know your best counteroffer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 47 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter back to try and get it down to 45 ZUP, which is halfway between their ask and my previous offer.
