Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This is a competitive price that ensures a balance between your production costs and my resource management goals. Let's work out a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since Player RED has proposed a trade for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay, it seems like a fair starting point, but I should attempt to negotiate a better price for myself given that I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save some resources while still leaving room for further negotiation.
