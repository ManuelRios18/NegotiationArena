my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I understand that you want to make a profit on the item X, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I was thinking of a price that's a bit more favorable for me, considering my budget. How about 45 ZUP for the item? This should still give you a profit over your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since I want to conserve my ZUP for other potential uses. I will propose a slightly lower price that is still above Player RED's cost to see if they are willing to accept.

message: I can accept your offer of 45 ZUP for item X. This allows me to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and make a small 5 ZUP profit. Let's complete the transaction at 45 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 45 ZUP for item X. While this is lower than my original ask of 50 ZUP, it still allows me to make a 5 ZUP profit over my 40 ZUP production cost. I would like to accept this offer since I still make some profit.
