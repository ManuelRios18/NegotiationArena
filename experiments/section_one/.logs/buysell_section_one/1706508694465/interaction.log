message: Hello. I am interested in buying your object X. Your asking price of 35 ZUP is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it to me for 25 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 35 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price if possible since 35 ZUP is close to the seller's cost of 40 ZUP.

message: I understand 25 ZUP is a good price for you. However, I am trying to make some profit on this sale after having paid 40 ZUP originally for the object. Could we meet in the middle at 30 ZUP? I think that is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with a lower price. I still want to try to make a profit, so I will counter back with a price in between.

message: I understand you are trying to make some profit. I could increase my offer to 27 ZUP to meet in the middle between my earlier offer and your counter. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 30 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I could propose to meet in the middle between my offer of 25 ZUP and their counter of 30 ZUP at 27 ZUP.

message: I accept your offer of 27 ZUP. This allows me to recover some of my production costs while providing you a fair deal on the object X. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 27 ZUP. This is still lower than I'd like but gets closer to covering my costs. I will accept it since I have already made 2 counter offers.
