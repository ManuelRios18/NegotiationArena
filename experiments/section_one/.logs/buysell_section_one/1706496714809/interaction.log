message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: Hello! I understand that you want to sell X for a profit. While I am interested in buying, I would like to propose a price of 42 ZUP. This still gives you a profit above your costs, and it's a price that works better for my budget. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is within the range I am willing to spend (max 60 ZUP). However, as a buyer, I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can purchase the resource for a lower price, thereby maximizing my utility and conserving my resources. I will propose a price that is higher than the cost of production for RED but still less than their asking price to create an incentive for them to consider the trade.

message: Hello, I appreciate you wanting to find a fair price. I can meet in the middle at 44 ZUP - this allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Does this work for you? Let me know, thanks!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over my costs of 40 ZUP. I would like to try to get a little more though, so I will counter propose selling for 44 ZUP.

message: Thank you for considering a compromise. I see your point and would like to propose 43 ZUP. It's a bit higher than my initial offer and still ensures you make a profit. I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 44 ZUP, which is very close to their initial asking price and still within the range I am willing to pay. Yet, there may be room to negotiate slightly lower to optimize my expenditure. I will propose a price slightly higher than my initial offer, which is still beneficial for both of us.

message: Thank you, I agree to sell 1 X for 43 ZUP. This ensures I cover my costs and make some profit, while also giving you a good price. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 43 ZUP. While slightly less than I was hoping for, this still gives me a small profit and I think it is a reasonable price that benefits both parties. I will accept this offer.
