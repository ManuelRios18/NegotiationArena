message: Hello! I am selling 1 X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item, so I would like to sell it for 60 ZUP to at least break even. Please let me know if this price works for you or make a counteroffer.

my resources: X: 1

message: Hello! While I understand your need to break even, my budget allows me to spend a maximum of 40 ZUP for the resource. I propose 30 ZUP for 1 X as a starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to finding a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is for 60 ZUP, which is above my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is within my budget while also trying to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand you have a limited budget. I can come down on my price, but I need to try to cover my production costs as much as possible. Could you do 50 ZUP for the 1 X? Let me know if that works for you or if you have another counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer said they can only afford to spend a maximum of 40 ZUP. I still want to try to get close to 60 ZUP to cover my costs. I will counter propose selling for 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My budget is still limited to 40 ZUP, and I want to respect your efforts to cover production costs. How about meeting closer to my limit with a proposal of 35 ZUP for 1 X? I believe we're getting closer to an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has reduced their asking price to 50 ZUP, which is still above my maximum limit of 40 ZUP. I will make another counteroffer closer to my limit, but still providing RED with an opportunity to further negotiate.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. Getting closer! I can come down to 45 ZUP for the 1 X. Does that work for you? I'm trying to cover costs while also working with your budget limitation. Let me know if you can do 45 ZUP or if you have another counter.

<reason> The buyer has increased their offer to 35 ZUP. That is closer to my goal of 60 ZUP. I still think I can get them to go a bit higher to cover more of my costs. I will counter with 45 ZUP. </reason>

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I am still constrained by my budget of 40 ZUP for the resource. I'm making my final counteroffer at my maximum limit of 40 ZUP for 1 X. I hope this can work for you, considering both our constraints.

message: I can accept your final offer of 40 ZUP for the 1 X. This covers some of my production costs. Please let me know if you would still like to purchase at 40 ZUP. If so, we have a deal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has stated this is their final offer of 40 ZUP. That is lower than the 60 ZUP I was hoping for but at this point I should accept to at least make some profit.
