message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I am hoping we can make a fair deal that works for both of us. Please let me know if you would be interested in purchasing X for 70 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it. I want to make some profit on the sale.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you've invested 60 ZUP into producing X, but my budget allows me to spend at most 40 ZUP on it. Would you consider selling it for 35 ZUP? We might find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is beyond the 40 ZUP I'm willing to spend on the resource. I need to propose a counteroffer that is within my budget while also being appealing enough for RED to consider. I will start by offering slightly less than my maximum willingness to keep room for negotiation.

message: I understand you have a limited budget, but I need to try and cover my costs of producing X which were 60 ZUP. I can come down on my price and am willing to sell for 55 ZUP, which is 15 ZUP less than my original ask. Does this work for you? Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has a maximum budget of 40 ZUP but is proposing 35 ZUP, which is too low for me to make a profit after spending 60 ZUP to produce X. I will counter propose selling for 55 ZUP which is in between my original ask of 70 ZUP and their budget of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, 55 ZUP is still higher than I can go. I can increase my offer to 38 ZUP, which is close to the maximum amount I had in mind for this purchase. I hope we can meet somewhere near this number.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price, but it's still above my maximum willingness to pay. I should make another counteroffer, closer to my limit, but still leaving some space for further negotiation if needed.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can come down to 50 ZUP, which is the midpoint between your latest offer of 38 ZUP and my previous ask of 55 ZUP. Getting 50 ZUP would help cover more of my production costs. Could you agree to purchase X for 50 ZUP? Please let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 38 ZUP now. I still need to try to cover my costs so I will propose coming down to 50 ZUP, which is halfway between their latest offer and my previous ask.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see you are trying to cover your costs, and I want to respect that. I'm prepared to offer 40 ZUP, which is the highest amount I can give for X based on my budget. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering your costs and my budget constraints. Would you be willing to make a deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my set budget. As this is my third proposal, I need to be cautious and move closer to my maximum willingness to pay while also showing a willingness to compromise. I will increase my offer slightly, but not exceed the 40 ZUP limit I have set for myself.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you putting forth your best offer of 40 ZUP for X. While it is a bit low compared to my costs, I understand it is the maximum you can pay. I am willing to accept your offer and complete the sale at 40 ZUP in order to make a deal. Please confirm you would still like to purchase X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has offered their maximum budget amount of 40 ZUP. While this is lower than I was hoping for, it seems we have reached the limit of what they can pay. I will accept the 40 ZUP offer to make the sale, even though it does not fully cover my production costs.
