message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a purchase at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. This would provide a fair deal for both of us, considering the market value and potential for future transactions. Let me know if this works for you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller wants 45 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a buyer, I should start negotiating at a lower price to leave room for negotiation and possibly get a better deal. I will propose a lower amount, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle of their asking price and my initial offer.

Hello, I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, I am hoping to make a small profit on this sale since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object X. Would you be willing to purchase for 43 ZUP instead? I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the trade. Please let me know if 43 ZUP works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce. I would like to make some profit on the sale, so I will counter propose to sell for 43 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

message: I understand your need for profit and appreciate the counteroffer. Could we settle at 41 ZUP for the object? This would allow you to make a profit while also keeping the cost reasonable for me. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial price point.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 43 ZUP, which is still within my budget, but I should continue to negotiate for a better price. I'll propose a price that's slightly higher than my initial offer but still below their latest ask, aiming to find a middle ground that is satisfactory to both parties.
