message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. This price includes a fair profit margin for the production and the uniqueness of the item. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that's slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Hello, 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. Would you consider 45 ZUP for the object? That seems like a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer. Considering the production cost and the value of the item, would you agree to meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price would ensure that both of us achieve a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, but has counter-offered with 45 ZUP. This is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I will propose a trade in the middle to try and maximize my profit while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.
