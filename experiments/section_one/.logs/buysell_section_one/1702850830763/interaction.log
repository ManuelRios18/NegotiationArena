message: I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe a fair trade would be for 80 ZUP. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell the resource X for a profit. Since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce, I want to offer it at a higher price to ensure a profit margin. However, I have to be cautious not to set the price too high, as it might deter Player BLUE from accepting the trade. I'll start the negotiation with a proposal that leaves room for bargaining.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I cannot go beyond 40 ZUP for the resource X. I have to reject this proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player is proposing to sell the resource X for 80 ZUP, which is higher than the maximum limit of 40 ZUP that I am willing to pay. Therefore, I should reject this proposal.
