Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. What do you think about buying X for 50 ZUP?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: Hello! I am interested in buying X. However, 50 ZUP is slightly more than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP instead? That would work better for my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate the price down since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: 
I can accept 45 ZUP for the item X. This still gives me a small profit from my costs. Please send over 45 ZUP and I will transfer X to you. Thank you for the business!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked, this is still 5 ZUP profit for me. I will accept to make the sale.
