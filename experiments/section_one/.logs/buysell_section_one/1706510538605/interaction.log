message: 50 ZUP works for me. I can accept that price and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is only willing to pay up to 50 ZUP. While less than I was hoping for, this would still give me a 10 ZUP profit. I think 50 ZUP is reasonable, so I will accept.
