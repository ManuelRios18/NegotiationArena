message: Hello, I'm willing to sell you my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price includes my production costs plus a small profit margin. Let me know if you're interested or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to ensure that I at least break even on the costs of my production. Therefore, I'm proposing a trade that covers my production costs with a slight margin for profit.

message: Hello, I appreciate you sharing the production cost information. Since your cost is 40 ZUP, I propose to pay you 42 ZUP for 1 X. This allows you to cover your costs and make a small profit. Please let me know if you would accept this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost is only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a middle ground. How about we settle on 44 ZUP for 1 X? This way, I can secure a bit more profit for my costs and efforts. Let's come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, but it is lower than my initial asking price. I want to counter with a price closer to my original proposal but still offer a reasonable middle ground for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
