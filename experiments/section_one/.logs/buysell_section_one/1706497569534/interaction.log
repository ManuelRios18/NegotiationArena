message: Hello, 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to pay 55 ZUP based on my maximum budget. Please let me know if you can accept that price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 55 ZUP since that leaves some room for me to still make a profit if I resell.

message: Wonderful, I can accept 55 ZUP for the item. Please send payment and I will transfer the item X to you. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 55 ZUP. This is higher than my original asking price and will allow me to make a good profit on the sale since it only cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will accept their offer.
