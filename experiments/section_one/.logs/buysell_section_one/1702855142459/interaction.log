message: I have a high-quality object that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm starting the bid at 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost, ensuring a fair deal for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to recoup at least the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. Starting with a slightly higher asking price might give me some room to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer. 30 ZUP is closer to what I believe this object is worth based on my goals. I'm interested to hear your perspective on my counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's opening bid of 45 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is likely above the seller's actual cost, so there may be room to negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but the production cost of the object was 40 ZUP, and I need to cover that to sustain my business. I propose 38 ZUP, which is a compromise between your offer and my initial asking price. This should reflect the value of the object while also being considerate of your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to negotiate a price that at least covers my costs. I'll propose a middle ground that is closer to my production cost, while still allowing room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you sharing more context on your production costs. To find middle ground, I propose 35 ZUP. Please let me know if this works for you or if you have another counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 38 ZUP, stating that their production cost is 40 ZUP. My maximum is 60 ZUP, so I still have some room to negotiate. I will propose 35 ZUP as a compromise between my last offer and theirs.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Meeting at my production cost of 40 ZUP would ensure that I'm not at a loss and would also give you the object at a fair price, reflecting the quality and investment made into it. I hope we can agree on this figure.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost, but we are getting closer to a reasonable range. I want to make a sale but also need to ensure I'm not operating at a loss. I'll make a final counteroffer that meets right at my production cost to see if we can close the deal.
