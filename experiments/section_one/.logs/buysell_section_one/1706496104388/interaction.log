message: Hi! I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 42 ZUP. This is above your production cost and should still yield a profit for you. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered an initial price of 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, as this is the first proposal, it's common to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still above the cost of production to ensure a profit for Player RED.

message: I agree to sell the 1 X for your proposed 42 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Please confirm that you agree to purchase the 1 X for 42 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still above the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce so I will still make a small profit. I will accept their offer.
