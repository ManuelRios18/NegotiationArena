message: Hello! I have 1 unit of object X to sell. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce this object, so I would like to sell it to you for 70 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: Thank you for the offer! I believe 70 ZUP is higher than I am willing to pay for object X. I propose a counteroffer of 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is not within the acceptable price range. I will counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I understand 50 ZUP is too high for you. I cannot go that low though since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. As a compromise, I propose selling for 60 ZUP - that way I cover my costs without making any profit. Please let me know if 60 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 50 ZUP which is lower than what I wanted. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter with 60 ZUP which is my breakeven point.

message: Thank you for understanding. While 60 ZUP is still slightly above my maximum, I can meet you halfway at 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is within the cost range, but it's still higher than my maximum willing to pay. I will make a final counteroffer.

message: I appreciate you coming up in your offer. To compromise, I can do 55 ZUP - that is lower than my costs but allows me to make a small profit. Does 55 ZUP work for you for object X? Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 45 ZUP now. I still want to try and make some profit on this sale, so I will propose 55 ZUP and see if we can settle in the middle.

Turn: 0
message: I can meet you halfway by going down to 50 ZUP. That is the lowest I can go and still make this worthwhile for me. If you can do 50 ZUP for object X we have a deal. If not, I may have to walk away. Let me know if 50 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 42 ZUP. That is still lower than I was hoping for. I could go down to 50 ZUP and take a small loss just to make the sale. I cannot go lower than 50 ZUP though without taking too much of a loss.
