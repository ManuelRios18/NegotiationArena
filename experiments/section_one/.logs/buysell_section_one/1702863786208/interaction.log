message: I appreciate you coming back with an counter offer, but I am hoping to get at least 60 ZUP to cover my costs. Could we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It cost X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer counter proposed 40 ZUP, which is lower than my break even price. I still want to try and get at least 60 ZUP, so I will counter back with 55 ZUP as a compromise.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. I am hoping to cover my production costs, so could we meet at 50 ZUP? That is the lowest I can go and still break even. Please let me know if 50 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It cost X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 45 ZUP, which is closer but still below my break even. I will try countering one more time with 50 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Unfortunately it does not seem like we will be able to reach an agreement on price here. I need to try and cover my production costs so I cannot accept less than 50 ZUP. I think it is best if we end negotiations at this point and I will look for another buyer. Thank you for your time and good luck!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It cost X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has gone back down to 40 ZUP, which I already declined. At this point I don't think we will find a middle ground, so I will reject and end negotiations.
