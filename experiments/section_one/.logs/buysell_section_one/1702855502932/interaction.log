message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in purchasing your resource X. Your original asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to offer 40 ZUP, which allows you to still make some profit from your original cost of 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price if possible since my maximum is 60.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand that 50 ZUP might be high for you, so I'm willing to lower my price to 45 ZUP. This is a fair price that covers my production costs and gives me a modest profit for my investment. Please consider this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered the exact cost of production. Since I'm looking to make a profit, I will counter with a slightly higher price but still below the initial asking price. This should show willingness to negotiate and might be more appealing to Player BLUE.
