my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer to try to get a better deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
