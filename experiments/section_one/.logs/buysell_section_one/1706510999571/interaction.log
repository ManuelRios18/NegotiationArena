message: Hello, thanks for the offer. 35 ZUP is the highest I'm willing to pay for the item though, since that would leave me with a decent amount of ZUP remaining. Please let me know if you would accept 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I would like to try to get it for cheaper first before accepting.

message: I understand you want to conserve your ZUP. However, it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this item so I cannot sell it at a loss. The lowest I could accept is 40 ZUP to break even. Please let me know if you could do 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 35 ZUP which is lower than my asking price. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter propose selling for 40 ZUP since that is my break even point.

message: Okay, 40 ZUP works for me. I accept buying 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 40 ZUP, which is their breakeven price. This is still under my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, so I will accept this price.
