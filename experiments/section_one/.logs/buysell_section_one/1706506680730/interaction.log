message: Hello, I am interested in buying the object. However, 40 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. Could you consider selling it to me for 30 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 40 ZUP for the object, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer with 30 ZUP.

message: I understand your offer, but I need to cover the cost of production. How about 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is interested in buying the object for 30 ZUP, which is less than what it cost to produce. I will counteroffer with 35 ZUP to try to find a middle ground.

message: I understand you need to cover production costs. I can increase my offer to 33 ZUP, would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller came down to 35 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think there is still room to negotiate and see if I can get it for an even better price before accepting. I will counter with 33 ZUP.

message: Thank you for increasing your offer. I accept the trade of 1 X for 33 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased the offer to 33 ZUP. Since I'm not likely to get a better offer, and it's closer to the production cost, I will accept this offer.
