message: Hello, 45 ZUP is a bit lower than I hoped for. Would you accept 50 ZUP for the object? That is the highest I'm willing to pay.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 45 ZUP for the object, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since it is closer to my maximum.
