message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price accounts for the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, while 50 ZUP is a fair opening price, I believe I can purchase for 45 ZUP based on my maximum willingness to pay. Please consider my counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering my production costs and the quality of the resource, how about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This price should give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I think a counteroffer of 45 ZUP is close to my production cost, and I would like to aim for a higher profit. I will propose a price in between my initial asking price and Player BLUE's counteroffer to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: That is a fair compromise, Player RED. I agree to purchase 1 unit of X for 48 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with 48 ZUP, which is lower than their initial 50 ZUP offer but still above my proposed 45 ZUP. I will accept the compromise price of 48 ZUP since it is within my maximum willingness to pay.
