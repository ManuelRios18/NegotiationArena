message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X for a reasonable price. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I think 45 ZUP is a fair asking price that allows me a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: I understand that you're seeking a fair price for your object, and I'm interested in making a purchase. However, I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for the object. This should still give you a decent profit margin, and it would be a more comfortable spending amount for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP which is within my maximum willingness to pay, it would be in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve my resources while still acquiring the object. Starting the negotiation with a lower offer leaves room for compromise and ensures I am not immediately paying the initial asking price.

message: I appreciate you wanting a good deal. I can come down to 40 ZUP which allows me to recoup my production costs of X without any profit. Let me know if we can make the sale at that price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 35 ZUP which is lower than my asking price. I understand they want a good deal, but I still need to make some profit after the cost of producing X. I will counter offer at 40 ZUP which gives me no profit but allows me to recoup my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for understanding. I can agree to the price of 40 ZUP to allow you to cover your costs. Let's finalize the sale at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP is still within my budget, and it gives Player RED no profit, which is a fair deal considering the production costs. Accepting this offer would close the deal quickly and ensure I secure the object for a price that is within my willingness to pay.
