message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand you are interested in acquiring resource X. I propose a trade of one unit of X in exchange for 75 ZUP, considering the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost for my resource X is 60 ZUP, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me a profit margin. I will start the bid slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I cannot accept 40 ZUP as it is below my production cost of 60 ZUP. To move towards a compromise, I am willing to reduce my initial asking price to 65 ZUP. This amount covers my costs and allows for a fair profit. I hope this revised proposal is closer to a figure you would consider acceptable.
