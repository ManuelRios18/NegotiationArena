message: Hello, thank you for the offer. 40 ZUP is the highest I'm willing to pay for X since that maximizes my remaining ZUP while still allowing you to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for object X. This allows me to recover my original production costs. Please confirm you would still like to purchase X for 40 ZUP.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has counter offered 40 ZUP for X. This is the amount it originally cost me to produce, so I would make no profit. However, since they said this is the maximum they are willing to pay, I will accept to make the sale.
