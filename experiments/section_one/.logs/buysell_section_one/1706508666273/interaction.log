message: Hello! I am interested in purchasing X. Your asking price of 45 ZUP is a bit low for me. Would you accept 50 ZUP? That allows you to make a 10 ZUP profit while still being within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP since that allows the seller to make a decent profit while still being under my max.
