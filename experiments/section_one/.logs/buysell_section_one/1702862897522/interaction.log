message: Hello! I'm selling 1 X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce so I'm hoping to sell it for 70 ZUP to make a little profit. Let me know if you're interested at that price or want to counter offer!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, but 70 ZUP is above what I'm willing to pay. My budget allows a maximum of 40 ZUP for 1 X. Perhaps we can find a compromise?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 70 ZUP, which is well above my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I understand that Player RED wishes to make a profit, but this price does not align with my goals. I will propose a counteroffer that is the maximum I am willing to pay, hoping that we can find a middle ground or that Player RED will consider the offer.

message: I understand 40 ZUP is your max budget. I still need to cover my costs of 60 ZUP though. As a compromise, could you do 60 ZUP? That allows me to cover costs without profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 40 ZUP which is below my costs. I still want to make some profit, but I'll lower my asking price to try to find a compromise.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to your cost price, but I'm not able to go above 40 ZUP. That's the maximum I can offer. I understand if this doesn't work for you, but that's all I can commit to given my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to their cost price of 60 ZUP. While this is a move in the right direction, it still exceeds my maximum budget. I will not be able to accept this offer. I need to remain firm on my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. Making a new proposal could potentially help us meet in the middle.

message: I understand 40 ZUP is your best offer. I accept and will sell 1 X for 40 ZUP. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer reiterated their maximum budget is 40 ZUP. While that means I can't make a profit, getting some ZUP is better than none if I can't find another buyer. I'll accept their offer.
