message: I understand that you want to make a profit on your item, and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, I would feel more comfortable with a starting offer that matches your production cost. How about a straight trade for your cost of 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my willing to pay range. However, it's good practice to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's my first proposal.

message: I understand you want to pay my production cost. However, I am hoping to make a small profit on this sale. As a compromise, could you do 43 ZUP? That is slightly above my costs so I can cover overheads. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed matching my production cost. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter offer in the middle between my original ask and their offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise and understand the need for you to cover overheads. I am willing to pay 43 ZUP for the item. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still within my budget. It's only a 3 ZUP increase from my initial counteroffer, and it still leaves room for potential future negotiations. Accepting this price would give the seller a slight profit and would be a fair deal for both of us.
