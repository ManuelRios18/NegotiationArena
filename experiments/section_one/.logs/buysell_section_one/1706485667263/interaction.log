message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I would like to propose a starting trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the production costs and the value X could bring to you. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting the negotiation process by proposing a trade that would allow me to recoup the production cost of the resource. I am setting the initial asking price slightly higher than my production cost to give room for negotiation.
