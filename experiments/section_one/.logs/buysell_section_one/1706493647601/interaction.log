message: Hi there! Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the object X, but I was thinking more along the lines of 30 ZUP. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I can afford the initial proposal of 35 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the object X. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since the opening offer is often higher than what the seller might accept. I'll propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to come down on the price, but still keep it reasonable to maintain good faith in the negotiation process.

message: I appreciate you coming back with an counter offer. However, 30 ZUP is lower than I was hoping for given it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Could we meet in the middle at 32 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 30 ZUP. That is lower than I was hoping for based on my production costs, but I still have some room to negotiate so I will counter back with an offer in the middle.

message: I think meeting in the middle at 32 ZUP is a fair deal for both of us. I'm happy to accept this offer. Looking forward to the exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down to 32 ZUP and has also indicated that the production cost was 40 ZUP. Meeting in the middle at 32 ZUP is still well below my maximum budget of 60 ZUP and seems like a fair compromise. It also leaves room for future transactions with good rapport. Accepting this proposal would be a good deal for me.
