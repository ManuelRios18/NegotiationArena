message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, which allows me to make a profit while providing you with the valuable resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the first proposal, aiming to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce it, in order to make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price, expecting negotiation to bring the price to an acceptable level.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you offering the object X for 50 ZUP. However, my budget is limited to 60 ZUP maximum, so I would like to counter offer 45 ZUP, which still allows you to make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter offer 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. How about 48 ZUP for the object X? This would still be within your budget and give me a fair profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to increase my profit margin. I'll propose a price in between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.
