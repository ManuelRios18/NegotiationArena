message: I'm offering you an exclusive item that has cost me 60 ZUP to produce. Considering its uniqueness and quality, I think a fair trade would be for 80 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. I will aim to negotiate from this point, but starting higher gives me room to adjust the offer based on Player BLUE's responses.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. However, the item cost me 60 ZUP to produce, and I need to at least cover my costs. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How about 70 ZUP for the item?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. I need to propose a counteroffer that at least covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. A compromise might be needed to come to an agreement.

message: I understand the need to cover costs, but I can only offer 45 ZUP for the item.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now proposing 70 ZUP for the exclusive item, which is still higher than my maximum price. I'll counteroffer with a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm surprised to see the offer go down. I really cannot accept anything less than my production cost of 60 ZUP. To move things along, I'm willing to go down to 65 ZUP, ensuring I cover my costs with a minimal profit. Please consider this fair offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has decreased their offer which is not acceptable since it doesn't even cover my production costs. I need to insist on a price that covers my costs and allows for profit. I will make a slightly lower offer than before to show willingness to negotiate, but I can't go below my production costs.
