message: I am offering the resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for 50 ZUP to cover my production costs and for a reasonable profit. Are you willing to meet this price, or do you have a counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that would allow me to recover my production costs and also make a profit. I am starting with a higher asking price expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate down.

Turn: 1
message: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Your asking price of 50 ZUP seems fair based on your production costs, but I believe 45 ZUP is a reasonable price that allows us both to profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer 45 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP and your willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource X. I would like to propose a middle ground that benefits us both. Would you agree to 48 ZUP for X? This price allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you room for profit as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, which is more than my initial asking price. They have proposed 45 ZUP for the resource, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since they are willing to pay more, I will propose a price between my initial asking price and their counteroffer to try to maximize my profit while still making the sale attractive to them.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 48 ZUP. This is still within my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept this price since it allows both me and the seller to make a profit.
