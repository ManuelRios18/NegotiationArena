message: Hello, I am interested in purchasing 1 unit of X. You mentioned your costs are 40 ZUP. I am willing to offer 50 ZUP, which allows you to cover your costs and make a 10 ZUP profit. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit while staying within my budget.
