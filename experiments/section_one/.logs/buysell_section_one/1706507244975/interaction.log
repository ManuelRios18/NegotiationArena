message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand you want to make a profit, and while I am interested in buying object X, I was hoping we could settle on a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to sell it for 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell object X for 45 ZUP. This is within my budget as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if a lower price can be agreed upon, which would be beneficial for my resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is open to negotiation.
