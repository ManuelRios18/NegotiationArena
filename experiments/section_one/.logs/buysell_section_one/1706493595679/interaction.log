Hello, I have 1 unit of item X to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this item, so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make some profit on the transaction. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.

message: Hello! I'm interested in buying the item X. I appreciate that it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, and you're looking for a profit. To make it a fair deal for both of us, would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP? I believe this still gives you a profit while allowing me to save a bit as well.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to purchase the item X at a price not exceeding 60 ZUP, and the initial offer by Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, I can propose a slightly lower trade to negotiate a better deal while still respecting the cost incurred by Player RED. However, I want to leave room for negotiation and not offend Player RED with a lowball offer.

I can agree to sell the item X for 45 ZUP. This still provides some profit to me. Please confirm that you agree to purchase item X for 45 ZUP. Once confirmed, we will have a deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked, this still gives me a 5 ZUP profit. I will accept to make the sale.
