message: I have one unit of resource X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for a profit above my production cost of 40 ZUP. I want to start the negotiation with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation and to potentially receive a higher final offer.

message: Hello, I am interested in buying your resource X. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it to me for 45 ZUP instead? That would work better for my budget while still allowing you to make a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, and I understand your budget concerns. However, I would like to meet in the middle and propose 48 ZUP for my resource X. This price would give me a slightly better profit while still considering your budget. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to counter-propose with a price closer to my original asking price but still give some ground to show willingness to negotiate.

message: I can agree to purchase your resource X for 48 ZUP. That works for my budget. Let's complete the trade at your proposed price. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 48 ZUP. This is still within my budget. I will accept this price since it allows me to buy the resource while staying under my max.
