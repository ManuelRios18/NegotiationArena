message: Hello, thank you for the offer. 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. Since it cost you 40 to produce, I am willing to offer 45 ZUP which would give you a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend as little as possible.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make a small 5 ZUP profit after covering my 40 ZUP production cost. I will accept this offer since it achieves my goal of making some profit.
