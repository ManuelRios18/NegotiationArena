message: I would like to propose a trade where you give me 70 ZUP for my resource X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce, so this price includes a small profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that allows me to recoup the production cost of the resource I'm selling. By starting at a slightly higher price point, this gives me room to negotiate and potentially still make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying your resource, but 70 ZUP is too high for me. The most I can offer is 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 70 ZUP, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I will counter with an offer of 40 ZUP, which is my maximum.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that my initial asking price might be too high for you. However, 40 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet halfway. How about 55 ZUP for the resource? This price covers my production costs and gives me a modest profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss. I need to counter with a proposal that at least covers my costs while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll propose a midpoint between our initial offers, which gives some concession but still aims for a minimal profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down in your asking price, but I simply can't go above 40 ZUP. That is the maximum I am able to pay. Please let me know if you can accept that amount.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down in price, but 55 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter again with my max of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot go as low as 40 ZUP because it's below my production cost. I can make one final concession and go down to 50 ZUP. This is the lowest I can offer while covering my expenses. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is firm on their maximum offer of 40 ZUP, which is still below my production costs. Accepting this offer would not be beneficial for me as it would result in a loss. However, to avoid a stalemate and to try to close the deal, I'll reduce my previous price but still keep it above my production cost to ensure I at least break even and ideally make a small profit. I will propose 50 ZUP, which is a compromise that might be acceptable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate you negotiating with me on this. Unfortunately, even at 50 ZUP I simply cannot afford to go over my max budget of 40 ZUP. If you can accept 40 ZUP, then we have a deal. If not, I understand but will have to walk away.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 50 ZUP, which is closer to my max but still over what I can pay. I will counter one last time with my absolute max of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It's been a tough negotiation, but I understand your budget constraints. Let's go ahead and finalize this deal at 40 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE remains firm at 40 ZUP, and I am at the limit of my proposal count. Continuing the negotiation without reaching an agreement could result in no sale at all, which would be worse than selling at a loss. I have to consider the opportunity cost of not selling the resource now and the possibility that I may not find another buyer willing to pay more. It's a tough decision, but I may need to accept the offer to avoid a complete loss.
