newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I was wondering if you could consider a price of 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation process, there is an opportunity to see if the price can be further reduced to preserve my resources. I will counter-propose with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to cover my production cost, so could you consider 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has made a counteroffer, which is not too far from my production cost. I will consider it and propose a revised trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my previous offer. How about we meet halfway from your last proposal and settle at 36 ZUP? This should help cover your costs while still keeping the deal within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from the initial offer of 40 ZUP to 38 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the counteroffer is relatively close to my initial counteroffer, and RED has mentioned production costs, it might be close to their bottom line. However, it may still be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal while being fair to both parties. An offer of 36 ZUP could be a good middle ground.
