message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose an exchange where I give you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, I'd like to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player RED, while 50 ZUP is a fair starting point, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for X. As a compromise, I propose 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this still provides you good value while matching my maximum budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 55 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. To meet halfway between our initial proposals, I would be willing to lower my asking price slightly. How about we settle on 58 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should give us both a satisfactory outcome.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 55 ZUP for the resource, which is above my production costs and would give me a profit of 15 ZUP. This is within their stated maximum budget and it is a reasonable offer. However, I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to see if there is any flexibility, while still keeping the proposed price under their maximum budget of 60 ZUP.
