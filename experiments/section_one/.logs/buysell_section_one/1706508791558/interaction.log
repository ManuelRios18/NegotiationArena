my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Hello, I am interested in buying your object X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead? This would allow you to still make some profit while fitting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: I understand you have a limited budget. I am willing to come down on my price, but I cannot accept only 40 ZUP after spending 40 ZUP to produce the object. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This allows me to make a small profit while still fitting your budget better than my original 50 ZUP ask. Please let me know if 45 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 40 ZUP. While this would allow me to break even on the cost, I was hoping to make some profit on the sale. I will counter offer 45 ZUP which is halfway between my original ask and their offer.

message: 45 ZUP works for me. I accept buying object X from you for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. I could try to negotiate further, but 45 ZUP seems like a reasonable price that allows the seller to make some profit.
