Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object, so I am hoping to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.

Hello! I understand that you are looking to make a profit on your object. Considering the market and the value of the object, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. This would still give you a profit above your costs, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation process by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has suggested, but still within the range that I am willing to pay. Player RED started with a price of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to negotiate a better deal, I will propose a lower price to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please confirm that you would still like to purchase at this agreed price. Thank you!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 45 ZUP for the object X. While this is lower than my original ask of 50 ZUP, it still allows me to make a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I would like to accept this deal.
