message: I have an object that may interest you. I've invested 40 ZUP into it and I'm looking to make a fair trade. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm making the first proposal to initiate the trade. I want to start by setting a price higher than my production cost to ensure a profit. I'm proposing a trade amount that is above my costs but not excessively high, so as to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your fair offer of 55 ZUP. Considering the quality and your willingness to pay a bit more, would you agree to 58 ZUP? This would ensure a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my cost price, which is good. They've also indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. I can either accept this fair offer or try to negotiate closer to the 60 ZUP they're willing to pay to maximize my profit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if they're amenable, considering their maximum is 60 ZUP.
