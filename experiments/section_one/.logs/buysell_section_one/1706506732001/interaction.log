message: Hello. I am interested in buying the object, but would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP instead of 40? That is the highest I can offer at this time.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 40 ZUP for the object, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price.

message: I understand your offer, but I can only sell it for 35 ZUP, which is lower than my production cost. Let me know if you are willing to meet halfway.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade offering 30 ZUP, which is lower than my cost to produce the resources. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Okay, I can agree to pay 35 ZUP. That is a fair price. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 40 ZUP to 35 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept paying 35 ZUP since it is close to my initial offer and seems like a reasonable compromise.
