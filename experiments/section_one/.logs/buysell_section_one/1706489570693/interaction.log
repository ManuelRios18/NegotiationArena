message: I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 35 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I want to negotiate for a better deal, aiming to conserve my ZUP resources as much as possible while still securing the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer of 35 ZUP, but considering the cost of production, I believe 37 ZUP would be a fair price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP for the object. I need to consider if I am willing to accept this offer or if I should counter-offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 37 ZUP sounds fair. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is only slightly higher than my initial counter and still well within my willingness to pay. It seems like a fair compromise, and accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object without further negotiation, saving time and resources.
