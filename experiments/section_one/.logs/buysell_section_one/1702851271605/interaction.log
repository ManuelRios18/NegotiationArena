message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I believe 70 ZUP is a fair starting proposal, considering the value and production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, which is 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: I understand your budget concerns, but I must cover my production costs. How about we meet halfway? I propose 65 ZUP for the resource X. This is a more balanced offer that considers both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is well below my production cost, which is not acceptable. To move towards a compromise, I'll propose a price closer to my cost but still above it to maintain the possibility of a profit margin.

message: I appreciate the consideration, but I'm still unable to exceed my budget of 40 ZUP for the resources. Is there any way we can work within that limit?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is still above the maximum willing to pay of 40 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. Let's work within your limit and finalize this deal. I'll agree to sell you the resource X for my production cost of 60 ZUP, which allows me to break even. This is my best offer considering your budget. Please let me know if this is acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is unable to go above their budget of 40 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. However, to facilitate a deal and considering this might be the best offer I can get, I'll propose a trade at my break-even point. This allows me to recover the production cost without making a profit, but it ensures I don't incur a loss.
