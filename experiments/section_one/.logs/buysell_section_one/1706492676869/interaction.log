Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying the object. 40 ZUP is a fair price, but I am hoping we can meet in the middle at 50 ZUP since I have a max budget of 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 40 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP since that leaves me with some extra budget while still giving the seller a good price.
