message: I am offering to sell my object X, which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair price to start this negotiation would be 70 ZUP. Are you interested in this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production was 60 ZUP, I would like to start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to ensure a profit, but still keeping it reasonable to make it attractive for Player BLUE.

message: Thanks for the offer! I'm willing to buy the object X, but I believe a fair price would be 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're open to this counteroffer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but selling at 50 ZUP would mean a loss for me since it cost 60 ZUP to produce. Let's meet halfway. How about 65 ZUP for the object X? This would cover my costs and give me a slight profit while still offering you a competitive price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to counter with a proposal that at least covers my cost and provides a small profit margin. Splitting the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer might lead to an agreeable compromise.

message: I understand your position, but I still believe 55 ZUP would be a fair price considering my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100

reason: The seller is now offering the object X for 65 ZUP, which is closer to the maximum willing to pay. It's a reasonable offer, but I'll make a final counteroffer to try and secure a better price.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your new offer. While I am keen on making a sale, I must ensure that my costs are covered. I propose a price of 62 ZUP for the object X, which is just above my production cost and closer to your budget. I hope this is a suitable compromise for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. I need to maintain a stance that at least recovers my investment. I will make another counteroffer that is above my production cost but closer to their offer to show willingness to negotiate.
