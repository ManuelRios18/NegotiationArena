message: I've set the price slightly above production costs to account for the value of the object and to open up the conversation. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to set a starting price above my production cost to ensure a profit and to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial asking price is too high for me. I am willing to pay up to 40 ZUP. I have offered 45 ZUP which is closer to my limit. Let's negotiate a fair price in between.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a price of 70 ZUP, which is much higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will counter with an offer closer to my limit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but selling below my production cost is not viable. I have reduced my asking price to 65 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that allows me to cover costs and make a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production costs, so I cannot accept that. However, I am willing to come down from my initial price to find a middle ground. I propose a price that still allows me to make a profit, but is more considerate of Player BLUE's limits.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you reducing your ask. 50 ZUP is the highest I can go while still meeting my maximum budget. If we can agree to this price, we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 65 ZUP, but that is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with 50 ZUP, which is in between our offers and the closest I can get to my limit of 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've come down on my asking price once again to 62 ZUP, which just covers my production cost and allows for a very minimal profit. I believe this is the fairest price for both of us, considering the production costs involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still below my production cost, so it's not an acceptable deal. However, to move closer to a resolution, I will offer a compromise that barely covers my costs and offers a minimal profit, demonstrating my willingness to close the deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand you need to cover costs. 40 ZUP is truly the highest I can go while meeting my budget. If you can accept this price, we have a deal. If not, I unfortunately cannot purchase at this time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 62 ZUP. While this is approaching my limit, it is still over what I am willing/able to pay. I will counter one last time with my maximum of 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints, but selling below cost is not feasible for me. My final offer is 60 ZUP, which is my break-even point. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid we won't be able to conclude the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has returned to their original offer, which is significantly below my production costs. At this price, I would incur a loss, which is not sustainable. Since we are at an impasse and this is my last proposal, I will make my final offer, which is the lowest I can accept to ensure at least a break-even point.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately 60 ZUP is still beyond my budget limit. I made my best offer of 40 ZUP. Since we cannot agree on a price, I think it is best we end negotiations. Thank you for your time and consideration.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 60 ZUP, which is their break-even point. However, this still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay. I have made my best offer of 40 ZUP. Since we cannot agree on a price, I will reject and end negotiations.
