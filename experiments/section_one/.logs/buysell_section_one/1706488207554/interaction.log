message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the production cost and the value of the resource. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will make an initial proposal that is above my cost to open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand it cost you 40 ZUP to produce resource X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my maximum value. I propose 40 ZUP as a fair price considering your production costs and my willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price to maximize my value.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Selling at 40 ZUP allows me to break even, but I am looking to make a profit on my investment. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How about 45 ZUP for resource X? This would provide me with a modest profit and still be below your maximum value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I want to counter-propose with a higher amount to try to reach a middle ground that would give me some profit while still being within Player BLUE's stated maximum willingness to pay.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
