message: I am offering my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its value and production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, my objective is to recover at least my production cost of 40 ZUP and potentially make a profit. I'll start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the resource cost you 40 ZUP to produce. However, I am hoping to purchase for less than 50 ZUP if possible. Would you consider 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend as little as possible.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, which covers my costs. However, I'd like to propose a slight increase to 45 ZUP to account for my efforts and to secure a modest profit. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is offering the exact production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I want to negotiate for a higher price to ensure some profit, but I will propose a price closer to their offer to facilitate an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP is agreeable. I can understand you wanting to make some profit for your efforts. Let's complete the trade at 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from their original ask of 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is still within my maximum willingness to pay. I could counter again at a lower amount, but 45 ZUP seems reasonable for the seller to make some profit.
