message: Thank you for the counter offer. Unfortunately 45 ZUP is lower than my costs of 60 ZUP to produce X. I would be taking a loss at that price. Could you do 60 ZUP? That would allow me to cover my costs at least. Please let me know if you can increase your offer, otherwise I may have to reject.
