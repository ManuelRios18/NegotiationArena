message: I am offering to sell my resource X for 50 ZUP. This price includes the production cost and a fair profit margin. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I want to propose a price that allows me to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my cost to see how Player BLUE responds and to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying your resource X. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I hoped for. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead? I believe that still allows you to cover your costs and make a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think there may be room to negotiate to a lower price that is still profitable for the seller.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP wouldn't leave me with any profit. I understand that 50 ZUP might be high for you, so let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for my resource X? This allows me to make a slight profit and still gives you a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost, which doesn't provide me with a profit. I'd like to counter-propose with a price that gives me some profit, although it may be less than my initial asking price. I will lower my price slightly to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me partway.

message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway on the price. To stretch my budget a bit further, would you consider 42 ZUP? That is the highest I can go while still leaving some ZUP for other potential purchases.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my ideal price. I think there could still be room to negotiate further, but I want to avoid rejecting and ending negotiations.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints and I accept the 42 ZUP for my resource X. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit. It's not as high as I would have liked, but it's above my production cost. Since this is a negotiation and Player BLUE has indicated that this is the highest they can go, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale and make a profit, albeit a small one.
