message: I understand your need for profit, but I'm looking to make a deal that's economically viable for me as well. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for 1 X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to make a counter-offer that gets closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay but still leaves room for negotiation. Starting with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay gives me leverage to increase the offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: I understand you want an economically viable deal. However, selling at 40 ZUP would not give me any profit after the cost to produce. Could we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? That would give me a small profit while still giving you a good price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to purchase X for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce. This would not give me any profit. I would like to make at least a small profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 42 ZUP.

message: Meeting in the middle at 42 ZUP sounds fair to both of us. I am happy to accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget and allows for a fair trade where both parties can benefit. It's close enough to the seller's initial asking price and my original counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise from both sides. Accepting this offer will conclude the deal satisfactorily without needing to use up more proposals.
