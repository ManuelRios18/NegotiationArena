message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I'd like to try to make some profit on top of recovering those costs. Does selling it to you for 60 ZUP seem fair? Let me know if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP> to recover the 40 ZUP it cost to produce. Get the highest price possible.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for 60 ZUP since that would give me some profit above the 40 ZUP it cost to produce.

message: Hi! I appreciate your offer and understand that you want to make a profit. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. Would you consider selling it for 55 ZUP instead? This price still gives you a profit over your costs and seems more in line with what I'm willing to spend.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED matches the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the resource X. However, it is generally beneficial to negotiate a slightly better deal if possible, especially since Player RED is looking to make a profit and has indicated a willingness to negotiate. I should make a counteroffer that is lower than 60 ZUP to leave room for negotiation but still within a range that is likely acceptable to both parties.

message: Thanks for the counteroffer of 55 ZUP. You make a fair point - that still allows me to cover my costs and make some profit. I accept selling my 1 X resource to you for 55 ZUP. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP> to recover the 40 ZUP it cost to produce and make some profit. Get the highest price possible.
reason: The buyer countered with 55 ZUP. While less than my original ask of 60 ZUP, this still allows me to cover my 40 ZUP production costs and make 15 ZUP in profit. I think 55 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
