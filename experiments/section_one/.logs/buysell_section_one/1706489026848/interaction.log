player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer but 50 ZUP is slightly more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP for 1 X resource. This allows you to cover your costs of 40 ZUP and make a small profit. Please let me know if you can accept this counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to cover my production costs and provide a profit. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 47 ZUP for my resource. This price would be a fair compromise between both our initial positions and still gives me a modest profit for my investment. Can we agree on 47 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is a bit less than my initial asking price but still above my production cost. I want to make a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer to hopefully close the deal with a reasonable profit.

message: Hi Player RED, I can agree to purchase 1 X resource for 47 ZUP. Thank you for negotiating reasonably with me. Let's complete this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 47 ZUP. This is still within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I will accept this offer since it allows the seller to cover costs and make some profit, while still being under my limit.
