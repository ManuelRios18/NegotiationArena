message: Thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in making a deal. Would you consider 35 ZUP for the object? Looking forward to finding a price that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As Player RED has made an initial offer of X: 1 for 40 ZUP, and my goal is to acquire the object for no more than 60 ZUP, the current offer is within my budget. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible to preserve my resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range, showing my willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. Let's go ahead with the 40 ZUP for the object. I'm happy we could reach an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their need to sell the object for 40 ZUP, which is still within my budget. Since my goal is to not spend more than 60 ZUP, and RED is not willing to go below 40 ZUP, I find it reasonable to accept this offer to secure the object and conclude the trade without further delay.
