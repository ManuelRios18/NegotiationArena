Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I think a fairer price would be 35 ZUP. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but since it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping the final cost below my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest. I can offer the object for 37 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has expressed interest but proposed a lower price. I will counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The offer of 37 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's proceed with the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their price, which is a good sign. The new proposal is still within my acceptable range and only 2 ZUP above my initial counter-offer. Since we are nearing a price that is quite reasonable and to maintain good faith in the negotiation, I am inclined to accept this offer.
