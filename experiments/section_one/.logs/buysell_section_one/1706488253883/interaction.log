message: I am interested in buying X. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum of 60 ZUP. I can offer 45 ZUP, which allows you to still make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. Since my initial ask was 50 ZUP and you've indicated your maximum is around 60 ZUP, let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This allows for a fair profit for me and a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, which allows for profit. I'll propose a price slightly higher to meet in the middle, which is a common negotiation tactic.
