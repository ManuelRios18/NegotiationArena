message: I appreciate the negotiation and your need to cover production costs. Let's finalize the deal at 37 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and just one ZUP above my last proposal. It's still within my budget and allows me to acquire the resource without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. It's important to close the deal at a good price for both parties, and 37 ZUP seems fair.
