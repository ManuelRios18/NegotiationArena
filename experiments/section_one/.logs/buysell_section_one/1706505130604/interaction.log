Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This is closer to the value I had in mind for a single object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay. It's in my interest to propose a counteroffer that's lower to leave room for negotiation and to potentially save some of my resources. I will propose a price that is within a reasonable range but still below my maximum threshold.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is closer to the cost of production. I will consider this offer.
