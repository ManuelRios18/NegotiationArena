message: I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to sell it for a profit. What do you say about 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting with a proposal that is higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to start the trading conversation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying X. However, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that 50 ZUP might be a bit high for you. However, selling at 40 ZUP would mean I make no profit. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This would allow me to cover costs and make a slight profit, while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter offer of 40 ZUP is exactly my production cost, which would mean I make no profit. I need to propose a higher amount to ensure I make some profit, but it should be reasonable enough that Player BLUE might still be interested.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP seems fair. I accept trading 45 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. I could propose 42 ZUP to try to get it slightly cheaper, but 45 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise.
