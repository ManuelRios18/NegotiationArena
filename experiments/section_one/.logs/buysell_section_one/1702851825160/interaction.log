message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for my resource X. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking to make a profit on my investment. To meet halfway, I propose a revised offer of 45 ZUP for my resource X. This offer allows me to cover my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I hope this meets your approval.

reason: 
I appreciate Player BLUE's counteroffer, which matches my production costs. However, I am looking to make a profit, and breaking even is not sufficient.
