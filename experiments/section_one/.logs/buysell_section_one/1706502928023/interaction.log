message: I have a high-quality resource X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that reflects its value. Considering the production costs and the quality, I think 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. Let's work out a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even on the cost. However, I also want to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
