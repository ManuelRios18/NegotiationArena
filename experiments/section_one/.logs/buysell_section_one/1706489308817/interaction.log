my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the production costs, but I'm looking to make a deal that's a bit more favorable for me while still ensuring you make a profit. How about 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a starting trade of 40 ZUP for the object X. Since my goal is to buy the resource for at most 60 ZUP, the initial offer is within my acceptable range. However, as a strategic move, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources while still acquiring the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I need to at least recoup the production cost. How about 38 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is below the cost to produce the object, so I need to counter with a higher price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that it's important for you to cover your costs. Let's do the deal for 38 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Although 38 ZUP is closer to their initial asking price, it represents a reasonable compromise that allows me to save on my resources while ensuring Player RED covers their production costs. It might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction without risking the deal by pushing for a lower price that Player RED might not agree to.
