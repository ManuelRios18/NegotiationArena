message: I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking of a slightly lower price. How about 35 ZUP for the item?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goals of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as it is the first offer, it might be beneficial to negotiate for a better price while ensuring that the seller remains interested. A counteroffer slightly below the asking price could lead to a better deal while keeping the negotiation open.
