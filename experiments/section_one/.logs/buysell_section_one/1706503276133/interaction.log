Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and a small margin. Let's negotiate a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I'll start by asking for slightly more than my production costs to open negotiations and to cover any additional costs such as transaction fees or bargaining room.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your opening price seems fair, but I believe I can get this resource for cheaper elsewhere. I can offer 40 ZUP, which should still cover your costs.
player answer: COUNTER PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is less than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This seems like a reasonable opening offer that leaves room for some negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to get the resource at a competitive price. However, I need to account for a minimal profit margin. Let's meet in the middle at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price gives me a slight margin while still being very close to my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, but it doesn't account for any profit or negotiation room. I should counter with a price slightly above cost to ensure a profit and to leave space for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 42 ZUP is a fair price. I accept trading 1 unit of resource X for 42 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 42 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I could counter again for an even lower price, but 42 seems fair for both parties.
