message: Hello! I am selling 1 X resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make some profit. Please let me know if you are willing to purchase it for 50 ZUP.

message: Thanks for the offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm looking to get a better deal as well. How about I buy the resource for 45 ZUP? This would still give you a profit of 5 ZUP over your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am starting with a counter-proposal that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay but higher than the cost of production for Player RED. This should leave room for negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Deal accepted. I will sell you 1 X resource for 45 ZUP. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit of 5 ZUP. I think this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
