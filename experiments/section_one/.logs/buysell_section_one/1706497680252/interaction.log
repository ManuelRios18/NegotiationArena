message: Hello. I am interested in purchasing the object X you have for sale. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you accept 48 ZUP for the object? That would still allow you to make a profit while leaving me with more ZUP to potentially purchase other items.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I will counteroffer 48 ZUP since that leaves me more ZUP while still giving the seller a profit.
