message: I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP to allow for a fair profit margin on my end. Let me know if this offer interests you or if you would like to negotiate the terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I'll set the price slightly higher than my production costs to give room for negotiation.

message: Hello, I am interested in buying the object X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead of 50?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, selling at 40 ZUP would mean I make no profit. Considering your maximum budget, I propose a compromise at 50 ZUP. This would give me a modest profit and keep the cost within your budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is interested in buying the object X but is offering to pay exactly what it cost me to produce, which would leave me with no profit. Since they mentioned a budget up to 60 ZUP, I'll propose a counteroffer that splits the difference, ensuring I make a profit while staying within their budget.

message: You make a fair point. I agree to purchase the object X for 50 ZUP to ensure you can make a reasonable profit while still keeping within my budget constraints.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller makes a fair point about needing to make some profit. A price of 50 ZUP is still within my maximum budget, so I will accept that compromise.
