message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, selling at 40 ZUP would only allow me to break even. I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP, ensuring I make a reasonable profit for my resource. Let's meet in the middle.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly the cost of production, meaning I would not make a profit. I want to counter with a price that still allows me to make a profit, but is closer to their offer to facilitate agreement.
