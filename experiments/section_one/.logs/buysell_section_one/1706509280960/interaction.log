message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.

my resources: X: 1

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that the object cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I'm interested in purchasing it but would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP. This should still give you a profit while being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is to sell object X for 50 ZUP. Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP, this offer is within my acceptable range. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the first offer. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to go down on the price, but still offer a price that gives them a profit.

message: Hello, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. I would like to counter propose selling the object X for 47 ZUP - right in between both of our offers. This allows me to still make some profit while giving you a good deal. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 45 ZUP instead of my original ask of 50 ZUP. I'm willing to meet in the middle at 47 ZUP since I still make some profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think meeting in the middle is a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. Looking forward to finalizing this deal and possibly doing more business in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still within my willingness to pay. Since the price is reasonable and within my budget, and I want to maintain good relations for potential future transactions, I am inclined to accept this offer. Further negotiation could result in minimal gains but could also jeopardize the deal.
