message: Hello! I am looking to sell my one X resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I am hoping to sell it for a small profit. Does selling it to you for 45 ZUP seem fair?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the resource for slightly above its production cost, to try to make some profit.

message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for profit, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Would you consider selling your X resource for 40 ZUP? This would cover your costs and ensure a quick sale.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but as a strategic buyer, I would like to propose a counteroffer that is lower to open negotiations and potentially save resources for future transactions or needs.

message: I understand you are looking for the best deal. I would still like to make a small profit if possible. Could we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? This would cover my costs and allow me a tiny profit margin. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay the exact production cost of 40 ZUP. I would like to make some profit, but I also want to make the sale. I will counter with a small profit.

message: That sounds fair to me. Let's meet in the middle at 42 ZUP for the X resource. I appreciate you working with me on the price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget, and it's only 2 ZUP over my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable middle ground that allows Player RED to profit while keeping the cost acceptable for me. Accepting this offer would conclude the transaction favorably for both parties without further negotiation, which could risk the deal or lead to higher costs.
