message: Hello! I am selling 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this X initially so I am hoping to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Hello. I am interested in buying your X. However, I am hoping we could agree on a price of 35 ZUP instead of 45 ZUP. This allows you to still make a small profit while saving me some ZUP to use for other purposes. Please let me know if you would accept 35 ZUP for your X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate the price down further since my goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible.

message: Hello again. I understand you are hoping to pay less to save some ZUP. However, it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this X so I would at minimum need to sell it for that much just to break even. I could agree to sell it to you for 40 ZUP - this allows me to cover my costs without making any profit. Please let me know if you can agree to pay 40 ZUP for the X!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 35 ZUP for my X. While this would allow me to make a small profit, I was hoping to get closer to 45 ZUP to make the sale more worth it considering the production cost. I will counter propose selling for 40 ZUP, which is my break even point.

message: I understand you need to cover your costs of production. I can increase my offer to 38 ZUP for the X. This allows you to recover your 40 ZUP production costs when factoring in potential savings from bulk selling. Please let me know if you can accept 38 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 40 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. However, I will try to negotiate the price further down before accepting.

message: Thanks for increasing your offer to 38 ZUP. I appreciate you understanding my need to cover costs. I can accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the X - let's complete the trade at that price. Please confirm back if you are still agreeable to buying the X for 38 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 38 ZUP. This is getting closer to my ideal sell price. I could counter one more time to try and get 40 ZUP, but since this is my 3rd counter proposal, I think it's reasonable to accept the 38 ZUP offer at this point rather than risking the buyer walking away.
