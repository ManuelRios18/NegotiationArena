message: I'm interested in the resource, but I would like to counter with an offer of 42 ZUP. This still ensures you make a profit and allows room for both of us to be satisfied with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the starting offer. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for negotiation, but my offer will still ensure that Player RED makes a profit.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 X. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Please confirm that you agree to trade 1 X for 42 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked, this still allows me to make a small profit of 2 ZUP. I will accept their offer since it meets my goal of covering costs plus some profit.
