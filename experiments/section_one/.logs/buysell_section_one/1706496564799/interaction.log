message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. While I am interested in buying the item X, Iâ€™d like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP. This still gives you a profit and allows me to save some resources for future trades. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, but it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will try to propose a slightly lower price that still gives Player RED a profit but is more favorable to me.
