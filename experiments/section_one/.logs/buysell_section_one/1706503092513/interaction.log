message: I'm offering one unit of X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it at a fair price that compensates for my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Let's start the discussion at 50 ZUP and go from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to see what Player BLUE values X at.

message: I appreciate you sharing the costs to produce. I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. Let's meet in the middle at 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and consider the value of the resource. Since you've mentioned that you're willing to go as high as 60 ZUP, how about we settle a bit higher than your last offer at 55 ZUP? This would still be below your maximum and give me a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Their counteroffer of 45 ZUP is below my initial asking price but above my production cost. I will counter with a price closer to my initial ask, as it seems there is room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You make a fair point about needing profit. I can meet at 50 ZUP, which is directly in the middle of your original ask and my max. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 55 ZUP. While this is still under my max of 60 ZUP, I think there is still room to negotiate to a fair price. I will counter at 50 ZUP, meeting in the middle.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree with your proposal of 50 ZUP. It's a fair price that meets both our needs. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 50 ZUP, which is the price I initially proposed and also gives me a decent profit margin over the production cost. It would be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a successful trade and avoid potentially losing the deal.
