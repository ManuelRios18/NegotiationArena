Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying the object X. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since I have a budget.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP and understand that you're seeking a fair deal. I've adjusted my initial proposal to meet halfway at 45 ZUP, considering both the production costs and the value of the object. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, but I would like to make some profit. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my cost to aim for a reasonable profit margin while showing willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down to 45 ZUP. To stay within my budget, would you consider 42 ZUP for the object X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I could accept this deal, but I'll try one more counteroffer of 42 ZUP to see if I can get it a little lower.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 42 ZUP is acceptable. Let's finalize the sale at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that is above my production cost, allowing for a small profit. I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to no sale at all.
