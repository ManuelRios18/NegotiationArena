message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am hoping to make a small profit on top of recovering my production costs. Does selling X for 45 ZUP seem fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for slightly above its production cost.

message: I understand you want to make a profit on your item. How about we settle for 42 ZUP instead? This would still give you a profit over your production costs, and it would be a more attractive purchase for me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the item and the seller is asking for 45 ZUP, this is within my budget. However, it would be prudent to negotiate for a slightly better price to ensure I am getting the best deal possible. I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground between my maximum willingness to pay and the seller's asking price, to try and save some of my resources while still making an attractive offer to the seller.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 42 ZUP. This is still a small profit for me so I will accept it.
