message: Hello. I am interested in buying item X. However, I am hoping we could agree on a price of 35 ZUP instead of 45 ZUP. This allows you to still make a small profit while saving me some ZUP to use for other purchases. Please let me know if you would accept 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since my goal is to spend as little as possible.

message: I can accept your offer of 35 ZUP for item X. This still allows me to cover the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce and make a small profit. Please confirm that you agree to purchase item X for 35 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has proposed purchasing X for 35 ZUP instead of my asking price of 45 ZUP. While I would prefer to sell it for 45 ZUP to make more profit, I am willing to compromise on the price since 35 ZUP still allows me to make a small profit over the 40 ZUP it originally cost me to produce. I will accept the buyer's counteroffer.
