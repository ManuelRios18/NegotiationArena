message: Thank you for your offer. I think we're on the right track, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price to move forward with this deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is a negotiation, I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire the item for a lower amount, leaving room for further negotiation if needed and ensuring I get the best possible deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: That sounds fair, and I respect your need to make a profit on the sale. I'm happy to agree to 42 ZUP for the item. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is within the range of what I'm willing to pay. By accepting this offer, I would still be purchasing the item below my maximum budget, and it would ensure a successful and quick negotiation without using up all my proposals. Therefore, I am inclined to accept this offer.
