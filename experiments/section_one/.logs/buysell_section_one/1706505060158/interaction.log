message: I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 35 ZUP. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but I want to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal, closer to the lower end of my willing range. I will propose a counter-offer that is lower but still within a reasonable range.

Turn: 1
message: Understood. I am ready to buy the object for 40 ZUP, as it's a fair price and within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED insists on a price of 40 ZUP, which matches the upper limit I initially considered. Since it is within my acceptable range and they have mentioned production costs, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure the transaction is completed favorably for both parties without protracted negotiation.
