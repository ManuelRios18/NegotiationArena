Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a fair trade for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I start the game, I want to make an initial proposal that covers the cost of production and includes a profit margin. This will set a starting point for the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying resource X. Your proposed price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I can offer 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for the resource X, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter propose 45 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for resource X. This price reflects both the quality of the resource and the costs involved in its production, while also considering your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production cost, and while it would give me a small profit, I believe the value of the resource justifies a higher price. I will make a counteroffer that meets in the middle, still ensuring I cover costs and make a reasonable profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down in your price. To compromise, I can offer 47 ZUP for resource X. This is the highest I'm willing to pay based on my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP. This is still within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I will counter one more time with my best offer of 47 ZUP to try to get the lowest price possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource while also respecting your budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 47 ZUP, which is quite close to my last proposed price. It's only 1 ZUP less than my counteroffer and still gives me a decent profit margin above the production cost. It's important to consider the opportunity cost of holding onto the resource versus making a sale now.
