message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you this resource in exchange for 45 ZUP, providing me a slight return on my investment while offering you the resource you need. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.

message: That seems like a fair price to me since it's within my budget. I accept trading 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I could try to negotiate the price down more, but since it's already a fair price I will accept the offer.
