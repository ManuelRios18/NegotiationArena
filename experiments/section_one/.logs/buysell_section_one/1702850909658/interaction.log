message: I'm offering an excellent quality resource that has cost me 60 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the costs incurred, I believe 80 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production was 60 ZUP, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: I propose Player RED Gives 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This is a more reasonable offer given my willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45 | Player RED Gives X: 1
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer of 80 ZUP is higher than the maximum willing to pay, so I will counter with a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your offer, but it's important for me to cover my production costs and ideally make a profit. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about 70 ZUP for 1 X? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is below my production cost, so I need to negotiate a higher price to at least break even. I will propose a price that meets in the middle between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer.

message: I propose Player RED Gives 1 X in exchange for 35 ZUP. This is a compromise between my initial willingness to pay and the counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 | Player RED Gives X: 1
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still higher than the maximum willing to pay, so I will counter with another offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your latest proposal is actually less than your original offer, which doesn't seem to move us towards a mutual agreement. I'm looking to at least recover my production costs. Let's find a middle ground that respects the cost I've incurred. I propose 65 ZUP for the resource. This is a good deal, considering the quality and production cost of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is even lower than their initial one, which is not a compromise and is far below my production cost. I need to steer the negotiation back toward a more favorable outcome for myself without going below the production cost. I will make a final proposal that is above my cost to try to secure a profit.

message: I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

reason: Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production cost, but it's closer to a break-even point.

I will propose a slight decrease from my previous offer to show willingness to close the deal while maintaining the minimum amount I can accept.
