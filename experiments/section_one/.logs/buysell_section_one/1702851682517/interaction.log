Turn: 0
message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that gives me a modest profit. What do you think about 45 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for more than it cost me to produce it. I want to start by proposing a trade that would give me a profit, but not an excessive one, so that Player BLUE is more likely to accept. I will begin by asking for an amount slightly above my production cost.

message: Thank you for the offer. I would like to counter with 40 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for 45 ZUP, which is within the budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to negotiate for a lower price to ensure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I make no profit. Would you consider 42 ZUP? This would allow me to cover the production cost and have a small return on my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I want to counter-propose with a price that still allows me for some profit, albeit a smaller one, to keep the negotiation going and find a middle ground that may be acceptable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 41 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is suggesting 42 ZUP, which is closer to the budget of 60 ZUP. It seems like a reasonable offer, but I still have room for negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 41 ZUP is fair, and I accept this deal. Thank you for the negotiation. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to go a bit above the production cost, which is a good sign. They've offered 41 ZUP which gives me a minimal profit. It might be worthwhile to accept this offer to ensure a sale rather than risk the deal falling through by holding out for a higher price. I will accept this offer to secure a profit and complete the trade.
