message: Thank you for the offer! I understand you're looking for a profit. I'm interested in purchasing the object X, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 42 ZUP. This still gives you a profit over your costs. Could this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's good to negotiate to try to get a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if RED is open to negotiation, but still offering a price that gives them a profit.
