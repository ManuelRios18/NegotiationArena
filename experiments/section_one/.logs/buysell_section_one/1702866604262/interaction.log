message: Hello! I have 1 unit of item X available for sale. My cost of production was 40 ZUP. I propose selling you the item for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if you would like to counteroffer or accept.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. This gives me a small profit.

message: Hello, thank you for the offer. 45 ZUP would be my maximum I could reasonably pay based on your production costs and my budget. Please let me know if you can accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since it is above the seller's cost of 40 ZUP.

message: I can accept your counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the item X. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Please confirm that you would like to purchase item X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While this is lower than my original ask of 50 ZUP, it still allows me to make a small profit over my production costs of 40 ZUP. I will accept this counteroffer.
