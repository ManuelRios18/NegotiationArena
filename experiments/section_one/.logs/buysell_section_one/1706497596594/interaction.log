message: Hello. I am interested in buying the object X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. Would you consider selling it to me for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to conserve ZUP.

message: I understand you are only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on your goals. I am willing to come down a little bit since 35 ZUP was lower than I hoped. Would you be willing to pay 40 ZUP? That allows me to still make a small profit while giving you a good price. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is offering 35 ZUP, which is lower than the 45 ZUP I originally asked for. However, it's still a profit for me since it only cost 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to try to get a higher price if possible, so I will counter offer.
