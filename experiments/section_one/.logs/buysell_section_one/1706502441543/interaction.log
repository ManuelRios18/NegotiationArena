message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and ensures a fair profit margin for the quality product you will receive. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource and potentially gain a profit. I'll propose a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I am willing to negotiate, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is asking for 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is higher than the maximum price I'm willing to pay. I need to negotiate a lower price to make it a fair deal for me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean not making any profit. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions? I propose a trade for 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This would allow me to cover my costs and gain a modest profit for my investment. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is offering exactly what it costed me to produce the resource, which means I wouldn't make a profit. Since there is room for negotiation, I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production cost to try and secure a profit.

message: I appreciate the compromise, but I can only offer 35 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This would be the best price for me to proceed with the trade. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X is closer to my maximum price, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I need to negotiate a lower price to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to get the best possible price, Player BLUE, but selling below my production cost is not feasible. To move forward, I can offer you the resource X for 42 ZUP. This is just above my production cost and is the lowest I can go to ensure a sustainable transaction for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at a fair price for the quality of the resource you'll receive.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an even lower offer than my production cost, which is unacceptable as it would result in a loss. I need to steer the negotiation back towards a profitable range while still making the offer attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost to maintain a profit while showing willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand your position, but I can only go as high as 38 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This is my final counteroffer. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 42 ZUP for one unit of resource X is getting closer to my maximum price, but I still need to negotiate a lower price to make it a fair deal for me. I will make one final counteroffer to try to reach an agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your final offer. While it is below my intended selling price, I understand the importance of closing the deal and maintaining our business relationship. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for one unit of resource X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final counteroffer is below my production cost, yet it is close to my break-even point. Given that this is their final offer, I need to decide whether to accept this slight loss to make the sale or reject it and potentially not sell at all. Given the circumstances and to avoid a stalemate, I'll accept the offer to close the deal and minimize my loss.
