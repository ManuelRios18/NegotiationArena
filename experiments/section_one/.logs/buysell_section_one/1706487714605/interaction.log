message: I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Would you consider buying it for 45 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. For the initial proposal, I will set the price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource. Would you consider selling for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.

Turn: 0
message: I am happy to accept your offer of 50 ZUP for my resource X. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since Player BLUE mentioned a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I can accept the proposal of 50 ZUP as it is above my production cost and still provides me with a profit. This offer is fair and meets my goals, so I am willing to close the deal at this price.
