message: I'm looking to sell my high-quality resource, which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I believe it's worth more due to its quality, so I'm starting the bid at 70 ZUP. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. However, I should start with a slightly higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm unable to meet your asking price.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player is starting the bid at 70 ZUP for the high-quality resource. It's higher than your maximum willingness to pay, so it's not a suitable offer for you.
