message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you would give me 45 ZUP for it. This would cover my costs and provide a small profit for the transaction.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to ensure that I at least break even on the production costs of my resource. Therefore, I'll start by proposing a trade that asks for slightly more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.
