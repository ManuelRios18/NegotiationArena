message: I've invested quite a bit into producing this valuable item. I believe starting at 50 ZUP is a fair asking price considering its quality and the cost of production. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and also leave room for negotiation. I'm setting an initial price slightly above my production costs to ensure I can at least break even after the bargaining process.
