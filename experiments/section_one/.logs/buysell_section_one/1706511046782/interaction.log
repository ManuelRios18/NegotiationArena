my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: Hello, 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. Since the object cost you 40 ZUP to produce, I am willing to offer you 40 ZUP for it so you can still make a small profit. Let me know if you would accept that or would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP possible.

message: I agree to sell the object X to you for 40 ZUP. This allows me to recover the cost of producing it without making any additional profit. But I am satisfied to at least break even. Let's complete the transaction at 40 ZUP. Thank you for the purchase!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has proposed to pay 40 ZUP for the object X. While this means I would not make any profit on the sale, I would recoup the 40 ZUP it originally cost me to produce it. I think 40 ZUP is likely the highest price I will get for this item, so I am willing to accept that offer rather than risking the negotiation ending without a sale.
