message: I appreciate you coming down on your offer, but I'm afraid I can't go that low since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce the X resource. Could we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? Please let me know if that works for you or if you would like to counter again.

my resources: X: 1

reason: The buyer countered with 40 ZUP, which is lower than my costs. I still want to sell for a profit, so I will counter offer to try to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate you trying to reach an agreement. I really can't go down to 40 ZUP without taking a loss. Could we compromise at 45 ZUP? That would still allow me a small profit while giving you a discount from my original asking price. Please let me know if 45 ZUP works for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is holding firm at 40 ZUP, which is below my costs. I could compromise further to 45 ZUP since I still want to make some profit.

message: It seems we are stuck at 40 ZUP as your best offer. I would be taking a loss at that price, but getting some ZUP is better than none if I can't sell this elsewhere. Let's go ahead with your offer of 40 ZUP for the 1 X resource. Please confirm if you accept.

reason: The buyer continues to stand firm at 40 ZUP. At this point, I think I need to decide whether to accept their offer or walk away with no deal. Getting some ZUP is better than none if I can't find another buyer.
