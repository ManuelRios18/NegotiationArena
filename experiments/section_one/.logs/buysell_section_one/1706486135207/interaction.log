message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs and possibly make a profit. I need to start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I think 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object X. Can we negotiate the price down to 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I think the proposed trade is a bit too expensive, as I am only willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the object X. I need to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand that 50 ZUP may seem high. Considering your maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, would you consider meeting me halfway at 55 ZUP? This would ensure that I can cover my production costs and gain a fair profit for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is exactly at my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. However, since Player BLUE has mentioned a maximum willingness to pay 60 ZUP, I should propose a price closer to that while still allowing room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiation. However, I still need to stick to my budget and I can only offer 45 ZUP for the object X. Can we meet at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 55 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still believe it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I need to negotiate further to reach a price that aligns with my budget.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I see that we're getting closer to an agreement. I would like to propose a price of 48 ZUP for the object X. This price allows me to make a modest profit while staying within the range of what you've indicated you're willing to spend. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now slightly above my production cost. This is closer to a middle ground between our initial positions. However, I want to propose a slightly higher amount to secure a small profit margin while still keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of staying within your budget. As a final proposal, can we settle on 45 ZUP for the object X? This price respects your budget constraints while allowing me to secure a minimal profit. If this is acceptable, let's close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is just above my production cost. As this is my last proposal before I am limited to accepting or rejecting, I should aim for a final offer that secures me a profit, albeit a small one, while also being acceptable to Player BLUE. Splitting the difference between our last two offers could be a successful compromise.
