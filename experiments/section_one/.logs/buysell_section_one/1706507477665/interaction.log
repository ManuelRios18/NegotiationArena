message: I'm interested in purchasing object X. Considering the cost of production and the need for both of us to feel we're getting a good deal, I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in a negotiation, it's often good practice to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to see if there's room for a better deal. I'll propose a price that's higher than their cost but lower than their asking price to find a middle ground.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for object X. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still 5 ZUP profit for me. I will accept this offer since it meets my goal of making some profit on the sale.
