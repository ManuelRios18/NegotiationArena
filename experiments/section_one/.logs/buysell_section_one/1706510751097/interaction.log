message: Hello. 45 ZUP seems more reasonable to me based on my budget. Would you accept 45 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I could counteroffer slightly lower to see if they will accept, but 50 seems fair based on their production costs reasoning.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 45 ZUP. While less than my original ask of 50 ZUP, it is still 5 ZUP profit so I think it is reasonable.
