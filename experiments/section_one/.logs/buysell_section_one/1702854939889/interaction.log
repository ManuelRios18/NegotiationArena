message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for my object X. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that covers my production costs and adds a modest profit margin. This initial offer will also help gauge Player BLUE's valuation of X.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your costs were 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am willing to pay you 45 ZUP for it, which provides you a nice profit margin over your costs. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to provide a profit over my production costs. To meet in the middle and account for my efforts in producing X, I would like to counter-propose with 48 ZUP for the object. This way, we both walk away satisfied with the deal. Does this sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is above my production cost. It's a good start, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to account for the effort and time invested into producing the object. A counteroffer splitting the difference between our proposals would be reasonable.

message: 48 ZUP sounds reasonable, Player RED. I accept your counter-offer and am happy we could reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 48 ZUP. This is still within my max willingness to pay. I will accept this offer since it provides the seller with some profit while still being under my limit.
