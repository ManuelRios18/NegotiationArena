message: Hello! I am selling 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this X. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Thank you for your offer! I understand your costs, but I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for 1 X. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's usually beneficial to negotiate for a better price, especially since the first offer is likely not the lowest they're willing to accept. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further. This will leave room for further adjustments within the negotiation process.
