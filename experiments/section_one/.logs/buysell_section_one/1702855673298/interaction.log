proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but 60 ZUP is above my budget. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 60 ZUP, which is above the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the object (X: 40 ZUP). I will counter with a lower offer that is within my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints. How about 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is interested in the object but has proposed a lower price. I need to consider if I'm willing to accept a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting halfway between our offers, how does 45 ZUP sound for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay. I should attempt to negotiate a price that is closer to my target of 40 ZUP, possibly by meeting in the middle.
