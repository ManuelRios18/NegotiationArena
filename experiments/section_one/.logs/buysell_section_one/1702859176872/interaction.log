message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. However, I was hoping to get a bit of a better deal. Would you consider selling X for 45 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this trade. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the seller's initial offering is 50 ZUP and my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I have some room to negotiate. I want to propose a lower amount to see if the seller is willing to come down on the price, but it should still be a fair offer above their cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Deal accepted! I can sell you X for 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and make a bit of profit, while still giving you a good price. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost to produce. I will accept this offer.
