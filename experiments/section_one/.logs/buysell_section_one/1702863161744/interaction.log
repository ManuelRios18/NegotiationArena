message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I'd like to sell it to you for 50 ZUP to make some profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: I understand the need for profit, but I'm looking for a slightly better deal. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the object X? It still gives you a fair profit margin above your costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay, but it is always a good idea to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the first offer is typically higher than the seller's minimum acceptable price. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still above the cost of production to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: Deal accepted! I can agree to sell the 1 X for 45 ZUP. That still gives me a good profit. Please send over the payment and I'll transfer the object. Thanks for understanding my need for some profit in this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a decent profit over my costs of 40 ZUP. I will accept their offer.
