message: Hello, 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. Since your costs were 40 ZUP, I am willing to pay 55 ZUP which allows you to make a decent profit while keeping within my budget. Would you accept 55 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 55 ZUP since that leaves me some extra budget while still giving the seller a profit.
