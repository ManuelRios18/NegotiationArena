Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 35 ZUP. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resource for at most 60 ZUP, the initial proposal of 40 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal to save resources while also moving quickly towards an agreement.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm firm on selling for 40 ZUP. Would you be willing to go for that?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your firm stance is noted, and I respect that. I am willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still within my acceptable range, and since the negotiation is time-sensitive and there's only one object, it might be in my best interest to secure the deal without risking losing the object to potential competition or stalling the negotiation. Moreover, saving proposals for future negotiations could be advantageous.
