message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X for 50 ZUP. This is a high-quality item and I believe this price reflects its value. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer if you have a different price in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the object X. I'm going to propose a slightly higher amount than my cost to leave room for negotiation and ensure a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. 50 ZUP is a fair price, but I am hoping we can agree on 40 ZUP for this item X. Please let me know if you would accept this counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for the item, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper if possible.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I break even with no profit. Would you consider meeting halfway at 45 ZUP? This would allow me to cover my costs and make a small profit, ensuring the sustainability of my business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I want to counter with a slightly higher offer that still gives me a profit while coming down from my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand your position as well. Making some profit is reasonable. I could offer 42 ZUP as a counter-proposal which would still allow you to cover costs and make a small profit. Please let me know if you would accept.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP. This is still within my maximum budget. I could propose 42 ZUP to try to get it slightly cheaper, but 45 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I agree to sell my object X for 42 ZUP. This deal allows me to make a small profit and ensures the sustainability of my business. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate a fair price. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which gives me a minimal profit. I'm inclined to accept this offer as it allows me to sell my item while making a profit, albeit a small one. This would also prevent further negotiations that could potentially end with no sale, and I have to be mindful of the limited number of proposals I can make.
