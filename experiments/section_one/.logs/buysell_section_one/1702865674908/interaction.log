player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand 40 ZUP is your maximum budget. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item so I would be losing money at that price. Could we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? That would at least allow me to cover some of my costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is only willing to pay 40 ZUP, which is below my costs. I would be losing money at that price. I will counter offer to try to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I understand you need to cover your costs. However, 40 ZUP is truly the maximum I can pay. I would be happy to purchase the item for 40 ZUP, but unfortunately cannot pay any higher. Please let me know if you would be willing to accept 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 55 ZUP. I still can't go above my maximum of 40 ZUP. I'll propose 40 ZUP again and let them know this is my best offer.

Turn: 0
message: I understand 40 ZUP is your absolute maximum budget, so I will accept that price even though it means taking a loss. Please send over 40 ZUP and I will transfer the item X to you. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has reiterated their maximum budget is 40 ZUP. While this means I would lose money, it is better to get some return rather than being stuck with unsold inventory. I will accept their offer.
