message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X that I have. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object originally so I would like to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make a small profit.

message: I'm interested in purchasing your object X. However, I was thinking more along the lines of a price that's beneficial to both of us. How about I offer you 40 ZUP for it? This still gives you a break-even point considering your costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. Since I want to negotiate for an even better deal, I will make a counteroffer that is lower than 45 ZUP but still gives RED a profit. This will leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Hi, I appreciate you looking for a fair price. I would like to make some profit though. Could you do 42 ZUP? That allows me to cover my 40 ZUP costs plus a small profit. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP to buy X. While this covers my costs, I was hoping to make a small profit. I will counter propose selling X for 42 ZUP - this allows me to cover costs and make a little profit, while still being reasonable for the buyer.

message: I can see where you're coming from, and I want us both to benefit from this deal. Let's meet in the middle. How does 41 ZUP sound to you? It's above your cost and still within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. There is a possibility of closing the deal with a small concession that works for both parties. I'll propose a slightly lower amount that should be acceptable to RED while still providing them with a profit.

message: 41 ZUP works for me. I can cover my costs and make a bit of profit. Let's trade X for 41 ZUP. Thank you for the reasonable negotiations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The buyer has countered with 41 ZUP, which is in the middle between my ask of 42 and their previous offer of 40. I am satisfied with a selling price of 41 as it allows me a small profit over my costs.
