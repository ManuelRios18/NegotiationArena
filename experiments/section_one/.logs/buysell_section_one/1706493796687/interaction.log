message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter offer.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that the object cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I am interested in purchasing it, but would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to make the deal more favorable for me while still ensuring you make a profit. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am considering the initial offer made by Player RED. They are asking for 50 ZUP for the object X. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, their price is within my range. However, I would like to propose a lower amount first to see if there's room for negotiation and conserve my ZUP for possible future transactions.

message: I can accept your counter offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This still allows me to cover the 40 ZUP production cost and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 45 ZUP. While less than my original ask of 50 ZUP, this still allows me to make a small 5 ZUP profit. I will accept this.
