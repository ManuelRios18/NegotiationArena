Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. I'm definitely interested in purchasing the resource. Considering the market and my budget, would you be willing to go down to 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, so starting the negotiation at 45 ZUP gives me room to negotiate or accept. For an opening proposal, this is a reasonable starting point. However, since it's the beginning of the negotiation, I might try to propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room to save some of my resources while still reaching an agreement.

message: I appreciate you coming down in price. To make this work for me, I would need to make a small profit over my production costs. Could we meet in the middle at 43 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed matching my production costs. I would like to make some profit, so I will counteroffer in the middle between my original ask and their offer.

message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a fair deal. I accept the offer for 43 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 43 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range, and it seems like RED is willing to negotiate. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy which works well for both parties. Since the counteroffer is only 3 ZUP above my previous proposal and well within my budget, it's a fair trade-off for securing the resource without much back and forth. Therefore, accepting this offer seems reasonable and efficient.
