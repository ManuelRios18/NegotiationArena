Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I find the asking price of 70 ZUP to be too high for my budget. Would you consider selling the object for 40 ZUP? This is the maximum I can offer based on my current resources and goals.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is too high compared to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 40 ZUP. I will counter-propose with a more acceptable offer closer to my limit.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to sell the object for 55 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you are looking for a higher price, but 55 ZUP is still above what I am prepared to spend. I can increase my offer to 45 ZUP. Could this work for you? It's closer to your asking price while still being within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price, but it is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a second proposal, increasing my offer slightly to see if we can meet in the middle while still trying to preserve my resources.
