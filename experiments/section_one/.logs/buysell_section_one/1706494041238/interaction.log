message: Hello! I am looking to sell object X that I have. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I am hoping to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a little profit. Please let me know if you are interested at that price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: Hello! I understand you want to make a profit. I'm interested in buying object X but was hoping we could meet a little closer to your cost. How about 42 ZUP? This still gives you a profit and makes the deal more attractive to me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a price of 45 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since the seller's cost was 40 ZUP and there might be room for a lower price closer to their cost of production. I will propose a price that gives them a profit but is also more advantageous for me.

message: I appreciate you meeting me closer to my costs. Making some profit is important to me though. Could we settle in the middle at 44 ZUP? That seems like a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 42 ZUP which is closer to my cost. I would like to make more profit, so I will counter propose selling for 44 ZUP which is in between my original ask and their offer.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I can understand the importance of profit for you. What do you think about compromising further to 43 ZUP? This way, you still make a decent profit, and it's a more compelling price for me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 44 ZUP, which is closer to their original asking price. Although this is still within my budget, I believe there is still a possibility to negotiate a slightly better deal that is beneficial to us both, given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will propose a price that is slightly higher than my initial offer but still less than their counteroffer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 43 ZUP. That is still a decent profit for me while making it an attractive price for them. I am willing to accept this price.
