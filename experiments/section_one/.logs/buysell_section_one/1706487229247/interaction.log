message: I'm offering the object you're interested in for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. However, I also need to consider that Player BLUE may want to negotiate and not pay too high of a price. I'll start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I am interested in purchasing the object. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I hoped for. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP instead? That would still allow you to cover your costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think there may be room to negotiate a lower price that is still profitable for the seller.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP. However, I am looking to make a profit on this transaction as well. Let's meet halfway and settle on 45 ZUP for the object. This price should be fair for both of us, covering my costs and providing me with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that only covers my costs without any profit. I want to make a profit, but I also don't want to lose the sale. It's important to compromise, so I'll counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer, ensuring I still make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP is a fair price that allows both of us to profit. I accept your counteroffer and am ready to complete the purchase at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this price since it allows both parties to profit fairly.
