Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi there! I am interested in making a deal, but was hoping for a lower price since my maximum budget is 60 ZUP. Could you consider 30 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives 1 X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 40 ZUP is lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, so I will counter with a lower offer to try to get a better deal while still leaving room to negotiate up if needed.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the object is worth at least 35 ZUP. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That seems fair. I accept paying 35 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 35 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this price since it leaves room for me to potentially buy more resources later if needed.
