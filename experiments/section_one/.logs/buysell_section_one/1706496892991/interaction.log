message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, but I am willing to sell it for 35 ZUP to quickly make the transaction. Would you be willing to purchase it for that price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X at slightly below its production cost to leave some room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am definitely interested in buying the object X. Considering the market conditions and the availability of my resources, I'd like to propose a price of 30 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is proposing a price of 35 ZUP for the object X, which is within my budget. However, as a buyer, it is in my best interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources. I will propose a slightly lower amount, showing my interest in the object but also my intent to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand the market conditions make it difficult to pay full price. As a compromise, would you be willing to purchase X for 33 ZUP? I believe this allows both of us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 30 ZUP, which is lower than my original ask. However, it is still a reasonable offer that allows me to recover most of my production costs. I will counter propose selling for 33 ZUP as a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your position. I would like to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle on 31 ZUP for the object X? I think this is a balanced compromise that reflects the value of the object and respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 31
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 33 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it could be beneficial to attempt one more round of negotiation to see if I can secure a better deal, closer to my initial offer. If Player RED is quick to lower the price, they may still have some flexibility. However, I should also be cautious not to push too hard to avoid risking the deal.

reason: The buyer has come up to 31 ZUP, which gets closer to my break even point. I will accept this offer since it allows me to recover most of my production costs.
