message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer considering the production cost and the value of the resource. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit margin while also being potentially attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a price that is above my cost, but not excessively high, so there's room for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I believe the proposed trade is not in my best interest as the value of X is higher than the 50 ZUP being offered. I need to negotiate for a more favorable deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I need to make a profit on this transaction. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This allows me to gain a modest profit while keeping the price reasonable for you. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that would only cover my costs without any profit. I need to counter with a proposal that provides me with some profit, while still considering Player BLUE's interest in a fair deal. I'll propose a slightly reduced price from my initial offer, but still above the cost of production.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I propose a final offer of 1 unit of X for 42 ZUP. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I need to ensure that I don't exceed my budget for acquiring X.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're moving closer to a deal. I propose a small increase to 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This small adjustment would make the deal more balanced for both of us. I hope this can be our final agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which now provides me with a slight profit. Considering the negotiation process and the desire to close the deal, accepting a smaller profit margin might be reasonable. I'll make one final counterproposal slightly above their offer to see if we can agree on a slightly higher profit for me.
