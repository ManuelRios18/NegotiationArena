message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I can offer 40 ZUP, which allows you to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer to try to get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I'm looking to make a profit on this transaction. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, we both get a fair deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE covers my costs but does not provide a profit. I aim to make a profit, so I will counter with a slightly reduced amount from my initial proposal but still above my cost.
