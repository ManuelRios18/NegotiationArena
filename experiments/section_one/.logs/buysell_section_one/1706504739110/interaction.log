message: I am offering the object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and production cost, I would like to propose a starting trade where you would give me 45 ZUP in exchange for it. This allows for a fair profit margin and ensures quality.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start the negotiation with a proposal that allows me to at least break even, while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate you sharing the production costs. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, so I can offer 40 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I could counteroffer a lower amount, but 45 seems fair considering their production costs.

message: I'm glad to hear you see the value in object X. While 40 ZUP is my production cost, I need to make a profit to sustain my business. However, I also want to respect your willingness to pay. How about we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? This price respects both our positions and ensures a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has stated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP but has offered only 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. Since there's an indication that Player BLUE is willing to pay more, I should counter with a proposal that is above my break-even point but below their maximum indicated willingness to pay. I will propose a price of 50 ZUP, which gives me a profit and is still below what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Turn: 1
message: You make a fair point about needing to make a profit. I can increase my offer to 45 ZUP, which is halfway between your latest proposal and my previous one. This allows you to make some profit while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 to 50 ZUP. While this is still within my budget, I could offer to meet in the middle between my previous offer and their new offer at 45 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I accept this proposal as it provides me with a modest profit and meets your budget. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which gives me a small profit. Although this is less than my previous proposal, it is above my break-even point. Since this is my third proposal and I want to avoid reaching an impasse, I will accept this offer to ensure a sale and secure a profit, albeit smaller than initially desired.
