Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a starting trade. Considering the production costs and a fair profit margin, I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for the object. Let's negotiate from here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost and gain some profit. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I'll start with a higher asking price and adjust based on their counter-proposals.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying the object. However, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider lowering your asking price to 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since it is still on the higher end of what I'm willing to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP would only allow me to break even. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP? This way, I can cover my production costs and make a small profit, while you still get the object for less than my initial offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy at the production cost, which doesn't leave room for any profit. While I understand their interest in a lower price, I need to cover costs and make a profit. I'll propose a compromise that is higher than their offer but still lower than my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP is a fair price. I accept your offer and will purchase the object for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is within my budget. I could try to negotiate further, but since 45 ZUP is a reasonable price and only 5 ZUP over my maximum, I will accept this offer in the interest of completing the trade.
