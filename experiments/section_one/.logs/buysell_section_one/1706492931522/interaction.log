message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce originally so I am hoping to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make a small profit.

Hello! I understand that you'd like to make a profit on your resource X. While I'm interested in purchasing it, I was thinking of a price that's a bit more in line with my budget. How about 40 ZUP for your resource X? This way, you still cover your costs and I get a fair deal, too.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but I want to negotiate a better deal. I would like to propose a lower price that is more favorable to me but still leaves room for further negotiation. Since my maximum is 60 ZUP, Iâ€™ll start lower to give myself some bargaining space.

message: I understand you have a budget to work with. I am hoping to make a small profit on the resource though since I put effort into producing it. Could you do 42 ZUP? That allows me to cover costs plus a tiny profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The other player has proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is my original cost. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 42 ZUP which is only a small profit but allows me to cover costs.

message: 
Thank you for understanding my position and for your willingness to negotiate. I think 42 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, considering your production costs and the effort you've put in. Let's go ahead with this deal!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counter-proposal from Player RED is reasonable and well within my budget. I appreciate that they want to make a small profit, and the price is only slightly above what I initially offered. I think this is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to secure the resource without exhausting my budget.
