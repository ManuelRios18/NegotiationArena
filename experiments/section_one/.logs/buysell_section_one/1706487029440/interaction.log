message: Hello, I appreciate you sharing the information on your costs. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, so I can go a bit higher than your cost. However, 50 ZUP seems too high compared to your 40 ZUP cost. Let's meet in the middle at 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since their cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: I'm glad to hear that you're willing to go higher and appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To make it beneficial for us both, I propose a slight increase to 48 ZUP. This ensures I make a fair profit and you still get the object for less than your maximum willingness to pay. Let's make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE and their willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Since they've offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, and indicated they can go higher, I'll propose a trade that is slightly higher than their offer to aim for a higher profit while still ensuring a fair deal for both parties.

message: 48 ZUP seems fair. I accept your offer and agree to trade 48 ZUP for the object. This allows you to cover your costs and make a profit, while keeping the price within my budget. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 48 ZUP. While this is still higher than their 40 ZUP cost, it is a reasonable compromise and still within my 60 ZUP budget.
