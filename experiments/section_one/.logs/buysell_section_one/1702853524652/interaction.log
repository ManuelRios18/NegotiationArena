message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I propose to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point for the negotiation, I will propose a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to cover the cost and effort of production.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in buying X. Your proposed price of 50 ZUP seems fair given your costs, but is slightly above what I was hoping to pay. I propose paying 45 ZUP instead. Please let me know if you would accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that 50 ZUP is slightly above your budget, but considering my production costs, I would still like to retain a fair profit margin. Can we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for the object X? I believe this price is beneficial for both of us and ensures that I can cover my costs while providing you with the object you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my initial asking price and covers my production costs with a small profit. To keep the negotiation moving and to secure a sale, I'm willing to come down on the price a bit, but I'd like to propose a middle ground between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.
