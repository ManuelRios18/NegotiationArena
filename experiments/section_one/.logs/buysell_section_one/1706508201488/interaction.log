message: Hello! I understand it cost you 40 ZUP to produce this resource. I am willing to buy it from you at cost so you at least break even. Would you accept 40 ZUP for the 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to buy it as low as possible.
