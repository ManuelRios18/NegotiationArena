message: Hello! I am looking to sell 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this item, so I'd like to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, and I'd like to make a fair deal. How about I buy the resource X for 42 ZUP? This would still give you a profit of 2 ZUP over your costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a lower price than what RED is asking, to try and get a better deal, but still offer a price that gives them a profit margin. I'll suggest 42 ZUP, which is above their cost but below their initial asking price.

message: I appreciate you wanting to make a fair deal. Getting 42 ZUP would give me a tiny profit, but I was hoping to get at least 44 ZUP to make this worth the transaction costs. Could you agree to buy X for 44 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While this would still give me a small profit, I was hoping to get at least 44 ZUP to make the transaction worth it. I'll counter back and see if we can agree on 44 ZUP.

message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a fair approach for both of us. Would you be willing to settle on 43 ZUP? That way, you're still making a decent profit over your costs, and I'm getting closer to the value I'm comfortable paying.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come down by 1 ZUP from their initial asking price, showing willingness to negotiate. However, I think there is still room to negotiate a slightly better deal, maybe meeting in the middle. I'm going to propose 43 ZUP, which is a compromise between my last offer and RED's counteroffer.

message: 43 ZUP is a fair compromise. I agree to sell 1 X for 43 ZUP. This allows both of us to feel good about the deal. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 43 ZUP. While slightly less than I was hoping for, this represents a reasonable compromise and still gives me a decent profit over my costs. I will accept this offer.
