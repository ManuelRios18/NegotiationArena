message: Thank you for the offer! I think a fair price for the X would be 45 ZUP. Let's negotiate and find a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The cost to produce the X is 60 ZUP and the seller is proposing to sell it for 70 ZUP, which is higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price.

message: I understand you want a good deal, but it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this X. I cannot sell it at a loss. How about we meet in the middle at 60 ZUP? That covers my production costs so I make no profit or loss.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer counter offered 45 ZUP. That is lower than my costs. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter offer with 60 ZUP which covers my costs.
