message: Hi, 30 ZUP seems more reasonable to me based on my budget. Would you accept 30 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 40 ZUP for the object, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer 30 ZUP.
