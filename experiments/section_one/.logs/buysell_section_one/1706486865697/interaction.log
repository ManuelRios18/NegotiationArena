message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiation is 45 ZUP, considering the value and quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and hopefully arrive at a final price that covers my cost and provides a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on the value this provides me. I propose 50 ZUP which allows you to still make a profit while staying within my bounds.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.

message: Thank you for your proposal of 50 ZUP. Considering the value of X and your maximum budget, let's meet in the middle at 55 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of X and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Their counteroffer of 50 ZUP is already above my production cost, ensuring a profit. However, since they are willing to go up to 60 ZUP, I'll propose a slightly higher amount to further maximize profit but still keep the offer attractive for Player BLUE.

message: 55 ZUP is acceptable to me. Let's complete the trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 55 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this price since it is fair for both parties.
