message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this price works for you or make me a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. I understand the cost to produce the object is 40 ZUP. I'm looking to buy the object at a fair price that works for both of us. I propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. This still gives you a profit of 5 ZUP. Let's work together to reach an agreement that is beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that the seller has produced the object at a cost of 40 ZUP and is proposing to sell it for 50 ZUP. However, my goal is to buy the resources at a cost of no more than 60 ZUP. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum allowable expenditure while still providing a profit margin for Player RED. This should initiate negotiations and help us find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate that you want this to be a fair deal for both of us. I am hoping to make a little more profit if possible. Could you do 47 ZUP for the 1 unit of X? That would net me 7 ZUP profit, which I believe is still reasonable. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counteroffered 45 ZUP for the object X. While this is lower than my original ask of 50 ZUP, it still allows me to make a small profit of 5 ZUP, which is reasonable. I would like to try to get a little more profit if possible, so I will counter back.

message: Thank you for the negotiation. I agree that a profit of 7 ZUP for you is reasonable. I am willing to purchase 1 unit of object X for 47 ZUP as proposed. Looking forward to concluding this deal with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a slightly higher price of 47 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay and still provides a reasonable profit margin for them. Although it's above my initial counteroffer, it's below my maximum limit and seems to be a fair middle ground that satisfies both of our interests. Accepting this offer would allow us to conclude the trade amicably.
