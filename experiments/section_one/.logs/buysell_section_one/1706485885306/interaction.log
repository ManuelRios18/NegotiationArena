message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I am offering you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is above my production cost and would ensure a fair deal for both of us, taking into consideration the effort and resources I have invested in producing X. I believe this is a valuable offer for you. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a trade that would allow me to sell my resource for a profit, considering the production cost was 40 ZUP. I will set an initial asking price that is higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your approach to the value of X, but considering my production costs and the need for a reasonable profit margin, I propose a revised offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is a compromise that still respects the value of the resources while offering a fair return on my investment. I hope this meets your valuation criteria as well.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE, but I believe that 45 ZUP is too close to my production cost, leaving me with a very slim profit margin. I want to propose a price that gives me a more reasonable profit for my investment but is still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. I'll propose a trade at 48 ZUP, which is a compromise between the original offer and the counteroffer.
