message: I understand you have a maximum budget. Unfortunately I cannot accept a price below my production costs of 60 ZUP. As a compromise, I propose selling for 55 ZUP instead, which is in between our initial offers. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered with 40 ZUP, which is below my costs. I would be taking a loss at that price. However, I am willing to negotiate. I will counter back with an offer in between our two prices.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. As a further compromise, I propose meeting in the middle at 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that considers both of our needs. Please let me know if you can agree to this.

Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately it does not seem like we will be able to find a middle ground. You are set at 45 ZUP which is below my production costs. I am going to have to reject and end negotiations at this time. Thank you for the dialogue and hope we can connect on a future trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come back to their initial offer of 45 ZUP. I have made several fair compromises to try to meet in the middle, but they are sticking to their maximum budget. At this point, I don't think we will be able to find an agreement.
