message: Hello! I am looking to sell this item X that I have. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I'd like to try and make a small profit if possible. Does selling it to you for 45 ZUP seem fair? Let me know if you have any other offers in mind.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. This gives me a small profit.

message: Hi! I understand that you'd like to make a profit on your item X. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP. This would still give you a profit over your production cost while being a more favorable price for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay. However, since there is room for negotiation and the goal is to get the best possible deal, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 45 ZUP but still above the cost of production to ensure it is also appealing to Player RED.

message: I can accept your counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the item X. This still allows me to make a couple ZUP profit while providing you a good price. Please let me know if you would still like to purchase at 42 ZUP. If so, we have a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over my costs. I will accept this as it achieves my goal of making some profit.
