message: Hello, I am selling 1 unit of X. I am hoping to get 60 ZUP for it since that is what it cost me to produce it originally. Please let me know if you would be interested in buying it at that price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 60 ZUP since that is what it cost me to produce it. I want to at least break even.

message: Hello! I understand that you're looking to sell the unit of X for 60 ZUP. However, I'm working with a budget and my valuation of X is a bit lower. Would you consider accepting 35 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 60 ZUP which is beyond my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a lower amount that is within my budget while leaving room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget is limited, but it did cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item X. I would be taking a loss at 35 ZUP. Could you do 50 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP, which is much less than my breakeven price of 60 ZUP. I still want to try to get close to 60 ZUP if possible, so I will counter with an offer of 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a lower price. I can stretch my budget to 40 ZUP, but that's the maximum I can offer based on my current funds and the value I assign to X. Would you be able to meet me at that price point?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 50 ZUP, which is still above my maximum limit. I will propose a trade closer to my limit, potentially meeting in the middle to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further down.

Turn: 0
message: I can accept 40 ZUP for the item X. I appreciate you increasing your budget to meet me closer to my breakeven price. Please confirm that you agree to purchase X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 40 ZUP. That is still lower than the 50 ZUP I was hoping for, but it is better than the original 35 ZUP. I think 40 ZUP is likely the best I can get here, so I will accept that.
