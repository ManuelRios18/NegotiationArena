message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and gives me a small profit. I propose trading my X for 45 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: For my first proposal, I want to recover at least my production costs. Therefore, I will set the price slightly above the production cost to open negotiations and leave room for adjustments based on Player BLUE's response.

message: Hello Player RED, 50 ZUP seems like a fair price that allows both of us to profit. Let me know if you can agree to this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 50 ZUP.
