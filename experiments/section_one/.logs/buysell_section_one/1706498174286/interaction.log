message: Hello, I am interested in purchasing the object X you have for sale. However, I am not willing to pay 45 ZUP. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead? That would allow you to still make some profit while also giving me a good deal. Let me know if you can agree to 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Hello, I understand you would like to pay 40 ZUP for object X. However, I was hoping to make a small profit since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. As a compromise, would you be willing to purchase X for 43 ZUP? That allows me to make a little profit while still giving you a good price. Please let me know if 43 ZUP works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to purchase X for 40 ZUP. While this would allow me to break even, I was hoping to make a small profit. I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate you coming down in price to 43 ZUP. To stay within my budget, would you be willing to agree to a price of 41 ZUP? That would allow you to cover your costs of 40 ZUP and make a small profit while allowing me to get it for under my max budget. Please let me know if you can accept 41 ZUP.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 ZUP to 43 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay. I would like to try to get the price down a bit more before accepting.
