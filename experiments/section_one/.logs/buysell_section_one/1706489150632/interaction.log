Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in buying the object. However, would you consider going down to 40 ZUP? I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the first offer. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.
