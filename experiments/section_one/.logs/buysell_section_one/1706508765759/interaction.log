message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I am hoping to make a small profit by selling it for 45 ZUP. Would you be willing to purchase it for that price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for slightly above its production cost, to try to make some profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am willing to purchase the 1 unit of X from you. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I can offer 50 ZUP which allows us both to make some profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This seems like a reasonable price that allows both sides to profit.

message: That is a fair offer that works for me. I accept selling my 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer is willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and has proposed 50 ZUP. This allows me to make a good profit while still giving the buyer a good deal, so I will accept.
