message: I'm offering a high-quality object X, which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a trade where we both can benefit. Hence, I propose 70 ZUP for this item, considering its value and production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to sell my resource X for ZUP to recover my production costs and potentially make a profit. My initial proposal will be slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a favorable outcome.

message: Hello, while your object may have cost you 60 ZUP to produce, I am only willing to pay up to 40 ZUP based on my goals. I propose 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 70 ZUP, which is too high compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will counter with an offer of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling for 40 ZUP would incur a loss for me. How about we meet in the middle? I can reduce my initial offer and propose 65 ZUP, which is just above my production costs. This way, it's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production costs, so I cannot accept it. I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production costs while still allowing room for negotiation. I will come down on my initial asking price but propose an amount that covers my costs and gives me a slight profit.

message: I understand you need to cover your production costs. As a compromise, I can offer 50 ZUP which is in between our initial proposals. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 65 ZUP, but that is still above my max willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP as a compromise.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Selling at 50 ZUP would still put me at a loss. I propose a slight increase to 62 ZUP. This covers my production costs and allows for a minimal profit, which I believe is reasonable for both of us. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 50 ZUP is still below my production costs, but it is closer to a middle ground. I want to make a small profit, so I will counter with a price that covers my production costs and offers me a minimal profit margin. This should be appealing to Player BLUE while respecting my bottom line.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand you need to cover your costs, but I simply cannot pay more than 40 ZUP based on my goals and resources. I propose 40 ZUP as my best and final offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 62 ZUP, which is getting closer to my limit. However, it is still above my max willingness to pay. I will counter one last time with my max of 40 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your constraints, but I cannot sell at a loss. My final proposal is to sell at my production cost of 60 ZUP. This is the lowest I can go while ensuring that the quality and value of the product are respected. I hope we can close the deal at this fair price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has reverted to their original offer, which is still below my production costs. Since this is my last proposal, I need to make a final offer that I can accept while encouraging Player BLUE to increase their bid. The goal is to achieve a sale that at least covers my production costs.
