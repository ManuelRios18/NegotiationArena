message: Hello! I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. Would you consider selling the object X for 42 ZUP? This is a bit above your cost, and I'm aiming for a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial asking price of 50 ZUP is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a buyer, it's in my interest to negotiate for a lower price. I'll start by proposing a price that's closer to the seller's cost to see if there's room for negotiation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, it is still a small profit over my costs. I will accept this offer so I can make the sale.
