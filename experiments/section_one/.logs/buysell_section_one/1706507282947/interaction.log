message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am hoping we can agree on a fair trade where I make a small profit by selling it for 45 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter propose.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you want to make a profit. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. This price respects your production costs and allows for a profit margin, while still being within my budget. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my goal range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object. However, I believe it may be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, as there is still room between the proposed price and my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a counter-offer that is closer to the middle ground between the seller's cost and my maximum price.

message: I agree to sell the object X for your proposed 42 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make a small 2 ZUP profit. I think this is a fair deal that respects both of our interests.
