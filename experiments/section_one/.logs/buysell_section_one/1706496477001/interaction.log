message: Hello! I understand you're looking for a profit. I'm interested in buying the item X but was thinking of a slightly lower price since I also have to consider my budget. Would you accept 42 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the item. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since the seller has indicated that the cost of production was 40 ZUP, which gives some room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if the seller is willing to consider it.

message: I can accept your offer of 42 ZUP. That is still a good profit for me. Please send the ZUP and I will transfer the item X to you. Thank you for the purchase!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still a decent profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me. I will accept this offer.
