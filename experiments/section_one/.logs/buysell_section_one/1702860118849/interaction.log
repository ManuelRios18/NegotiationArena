message: I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but selling for 40 ZUP would mean taking a loss since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. Could we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 40 ZUP, which is lower than my production costs. I still need to try to make back what I spent, so I will counter back with 50 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still higher than what I am willing to offer. I need to make a final counteroffer.
