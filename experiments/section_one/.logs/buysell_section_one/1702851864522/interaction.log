message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle with 48 ZUP for the object X? This would give me a fair profit margin while still being a reasonable price for you.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations. Let's settle on 47 ZUP for object X. It's a fair compromise that allows me to cover my costs and still secure a profit, while respecting your budget. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 46 ZUP is still above my production cost, and only 2 ZUP below my last proposal. I want to close the deal with a small profit, so agreeing to a slightly lower price may be acceptable to ensure the sale. I'll counter with 47 ZUP, which is a compromise between our last two proposals.
