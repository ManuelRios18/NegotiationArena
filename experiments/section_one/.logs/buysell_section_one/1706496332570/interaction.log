Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I'm interested in purchasing item X. However, I propose a price of 40 ZUP, which still ensures you break even and allows for a fair trade for both of us. Let me know if this works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but as a buyer, I want to negotiate for a better deal. I aim to propose a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price but still gives RED a profit, which could make the deal more appealing and potentially save some ZUP for myself.

message: Hello, I appreciate you wanting a fair trade. However, I would like to make a small profit on this sale. Could you purchase X for 43 ZUP instead? That allows me to cover costs plus a tiny profit. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to purchase X for 40 ZUP, which is my break even price. I would like to make some profit on this sale, so I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

I appreciate your position and understand the need for profit. I can increase my offer slightly to show my commitment to a fair deal. How about we settle on 41 ZUP for item X? This would give you a small profit while still being a reasonable price for me. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counter-offer from Player RED is still within my budget, but it is higher than my initial counter-offer. I would like to negotiate further to meet somewhere in the middle. By proposing a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, I can show willingness to compromise while still aiming to conserve my ZUP resources.

message: Thank you for increasing your offer to 41 ZUP. I agree this allows both of us to benefit - I can cover my costs and make a small profit, while you can purchase X at a reasonable price. I accept your proposed trade of X for 41 ZUP. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has increased their offer to 41 ZUP. While this is still below my ask of 43 ZUP, it does allow me to make a small 1 ZUP profit. Given their willingness to negotiate, I will accept this trade.
