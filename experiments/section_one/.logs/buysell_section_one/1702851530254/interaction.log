message: I have one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you this resource for 45 ZUP. This price includes my production cost plus a small profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: My goal is to recoup the production cost of the resource at a minimum. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to allow room for negotiation.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player's proposed trade is reasonable, as it covers the production cost and includes a small profit margin. Accepting this trade would allow me to acquire the resource at a reasonable price.
