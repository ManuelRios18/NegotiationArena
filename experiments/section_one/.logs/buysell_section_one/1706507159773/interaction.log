message: Hello! I am selling one object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 45 ZUP in order to make a small profit. Let me know if this price works for you or if you would like to counter propose.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make a small profit.

message: Thanks for your offer! I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm interested in buying. However, I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for the object, considering the market conditions. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object, but since the initial offer from RED is 45 ZUP and it's beneficial to negotiate for a better price, I will counter with a lower offer that is still above their production cost. This could leave room for further negotiation and potentially a better deal for me.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP. This still allows me to make a small profit over my costs. Please send payment and I will send you the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me. I will accept this offer since I still make some profit.
