message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am hoping to sell it to you for 50 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Would this price work for you? Let me know!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: I appreciate the offer! I understand that you're looking for a profit. Would you be willing to go a bit lower to 45 ZUP for the object? I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the market value.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's always good to negotiate to see if I can obtain the object for a lower price, especially since there's a margin of 10 ZUP between the offered price and my maximum. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I can accept 45 ZUP for the object X. This allows me to cover my costs and make a small profit, while also giving you a good deal. Let's complete the trade at 45 ZUP. Thanks for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still 5 ZUP profit for me. I think 45 ZUP is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.
