message: Hello! I am selling 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this X. I am proposing to sell it to you for 45 ZUP so I can make a little profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter offer.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: Thank you for the offer! I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm interested in purchasing X. However, I would like to counteroffer with 42 ZUP for 1 X. This still gives you a profit and allows me to save a bit of my budget for other expenses. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, as my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. However, it makes sense to negotiate a slightly better price if possible, partially because it's a common practice in bargaining to counteroffer and also because it might leave me with more ZUP for other potential uses. I will propose a price that's still fair and above their cost to maintain their interest in the trade.

message: I accept your counteroffer of 42 ZUP for 1 X. This is agreeable to me. Please send the payment and I will transfer the goods. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over my costs. I will accept this counteroffer since I want to make the sale.
