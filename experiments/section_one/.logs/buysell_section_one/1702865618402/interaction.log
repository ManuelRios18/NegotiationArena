my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

message: Hello. I understand you are limited to 40 ZUP for this purchase. However, I paid 60 ZUP originally to produce this item so I cannot go that low. As a compromise, would you be willing to pay 50 ZUP? Please let me know if that works for you, otherwise I may have to reject and we won't be able to make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is offering 40 ZUP, which is less than my 60 ZUP cost. However, I should try to make a deal rather than get nothing. I will counter offer 50 ZUP which is in between.

message: I understand you paid 60 ZUP originally to produce this item. Unfortunately I am firm on my maximum willingness to pay being 40 ZUP based on my available resources. Would you accept 40 ZUP for the item? If not, I will have to reject and we won't be able to make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 60 ZUP to 50 ZUP, but that still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will counter one last time with my maximum price before I have to reject if the seller does not accept.

message: I understand you are firm on 40 ZUP based on your resources. I would prefer more since my cost was 60 ZUP, but I am willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP so that we can make a deal instead of walking away with nothing. Please confirm you agree to purchase item X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is firm on 40 ZUP, which is below my cost. However, since I have already tried to negotiate and they will not go higher, I should accept the 40 ZUP to make some profit rather than get nothing if I reject.
