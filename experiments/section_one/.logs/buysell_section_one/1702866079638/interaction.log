my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate you coming up in your offer. I am hoping to make at least a small profit on this sale since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. Could you meet me at 55 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 45 ZUP which is lower than my asking price. I still want to try to make some profit, so I will counter offer 55 ZUP which is in between my original ask and their offer.
