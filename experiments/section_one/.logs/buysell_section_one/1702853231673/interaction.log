message: I believe the quality of my product justifies the price, and I'm looking forward to a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for a profit, considering the production cost of 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you starting this negotiation, but an opening offer of 50 ZUP is too high for me. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Could we agree on 30 ZUP for your product? That seems like a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's opening offer is too high for me. I will counter with a lower price that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your initial offer, but considering the costs and the quality of the resource, I propose 55 ZUP which is below your maximum willingness to pay and should reflect a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, but they have proposed 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I want to make a counteroffer closer to their maximum stated willingness to pay, but still giving them a sense of a discounted rate from my initial asking price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down in your asking price. To show I am willing to compromise as well, I can increase my offer to 40 ZUP. This is still under my max willingness to pay, allows you a fair profit, and lets us complete a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down in price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter again with a slightly higher price, but still under my max.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to work towards a deal. I've adjusted my price to 48 ZUP to ensure I can cover my costs and secure a modest profit. This should still provide good value for you while respecting the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 40 ZUP, which meets my production cost but does not provide a profit. I want to counter with a price that gives me a profit while still being reasonable and under their maximum willingness to pay.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
