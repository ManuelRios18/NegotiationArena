message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Please let me know if this price works for you or propose a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Thanks for the offer! I understand that you would like to make a profit. However, I'm looking to conserve some of my ZUP while still engaging in a fair trade. Would you be willing to accept 45 ZUP for the object X? This would still give you a profit over your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of object X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, it may be possible to negotiate a better deal, especially since it only cost them 40 ZUP to produce the object. I will attempt a counteroffer to see if I can save some ZUP while still offering Player RED a profit.

message: I can accept the counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This still allows me to cover my production costs and make a bit of profit. Let's complete the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The player has counter offered 45 ZUP. While this is lower than I initially asked for, it still allows me to make a small profit of 5 ZUP over my production cost. I will accept this offer.
