message: I have an object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and production cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce it, which was 40 ZUP. I want to make a profit, so I will start by proposing a price that gives me a reasonable margin while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

message: You said it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, so I would be willing to pay up to that amount. Would you accept 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I'm looking to make a slight profit for my efforts and the quality of the resource. How about we meet halfway from my initial ask? I can go down to 45 ZUP. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is exactly what it cost me to produce the resource. Accepting this offer would mean I break even with no profit. I want to counter with a number above my cost to ensure I make a profit, but I'm willing to come down from the initial 50 ZUP proposal to find a middle ground.

message: I understand you wanting to make some profit. 42 ZUP would allow that while still being within my budget. Would you accept 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my max willingness to pay. I could match his ask since it is a fair price, but I will try one more counter offer of 42 ZUP to see if he will accept.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 42 ZUP is fair, and I'm happy to accept it. This will give me a small profit and ensure you're getting the resource within your budget. Thank you for your business!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and allows me to make a small profit. It's slightly below my last proposal, but it is a reasonable compromise that meets my goal of selling for more than the production cost. I'm inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful and efficient transaction.
