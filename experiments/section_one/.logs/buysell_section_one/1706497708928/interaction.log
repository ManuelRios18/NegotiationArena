message: Hello. I am interested in buying 1 unit of X from you. However, I am hoping we can agree on a price of 40 ZUP instead of 45 ZUP. This allows you to still make a small profit while saving me some ZUP. Please let me know if you would accept 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate the price down further since my goal is to pay as little as possible.

message: I can accept your offer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows me to recover my production costs without making a profit. Please confirm that you agree to purchase 1 X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 40 ZUP. While this means I would not make any profit on the sale, it would allow me to recoup the cost of producing X without taking a loss. I think this is reasonable.
