message: I'm offering my object, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering production costs and the value of the object. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation process by proposing a starting price for the object. Since Player BLUE is interested in buying and I want to sell for ZUP, I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and ensure I make a profit.

message: I appreciate you sharing details on your production costs. A fair price to me would be 40 ZUP based on my maximum willingness to pay. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and willingness to pay 40 ZUP. However, I need to make a slight profit to justify the sale. Would you consider meeting in the middle at 45 ZUP? This price would reflect the quality and value of the object while acknowledging the costs I've incurred.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly my production cost of 40 ZUP, which doesn't leave any profit for me. I'd like to counter-propose with a price that allows for a small profit margin while still being reasonable and close to their maximum willingness to pay.

message: 45 ZUP seems fair. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is within my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept this middle ground price.
