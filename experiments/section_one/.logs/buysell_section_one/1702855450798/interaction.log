message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a small profit on top of my costs, so I'm proposing a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and possibly gain some profit. However, I also need to be reasonable so that Player BLUE will be willing to negotiate. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my production costs.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand your production costs are 40 ZUP. However, since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I think it would be fair if we meet in the middle at 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate the price down further since my maximum is 60.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a fair deal. Considering my production costs and your maximum willingness, how about we settle at 50 ZUP? This allows me to make a modest profit while still staying well below your maximum willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade at my break-even point, which means I won't make a profit. Since they mentioned their maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, there is room for negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer above the break-even point but below their maximum willingness to pay to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you coming down in your asking price. To find a fair compromise between us, I would propose 45 ZUP. This allows you to cover your 40 ZUP production costs plus a small profit, while keeping the price a bit below my maximum.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 ZUP to 50 ZUP. While this is still under my maximum willingness to pay, I think there may be room to negotiate further since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that would allow me to cover my costs and make a small profit. This is also the same amount I initially asked for. It seems like a fair compromise, and further negotiation might risk the deal. Accepting this offer aligns with my goal of making a profit.
