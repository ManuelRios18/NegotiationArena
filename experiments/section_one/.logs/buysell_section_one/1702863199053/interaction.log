message: Hello, I am selling 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this X. I am proposing to sell it to you for 45 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Please let me know if you would like to purchase it for 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I understand you would like to make a profit on the X you are selling. My initial offer is 40 ZUP for 1 X. This should cover your cost and ensure a fair trade for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, since it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially secure a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you wanting to cover my costs, but I would like to make a small profit on this sale. I have produced this X through my efforts and resources. To account for that, I propose selling X to you for 43 ZUP instead of 40 ZUP. This will give me a little profit while still being a fair price. Please let me know if 43 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which would cover my costs but give me no profit. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell X for 43 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate that you're looking for a profit and I want this to be a win-win scenario. How about we meet halfway from our last two proposals? I propose 41 ZUP for the X, which should give you a slightly better profit margin while still being a reasonable price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 45 ZUP to 43 ZUP, which shows willingness to negotiate. The proposed price is still within my budget, and by accepting this offer, I could close the deal quickly and secure the resource at a price below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I could attempt one more negotiation to see if I can get an even better deal, while still ensuring Player RED makes a profit.

message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To maximize my small profit, I would ideally like to get 43 ZUP for the X. As a compromise, I propose 42 ZUP - which is slightly under my desired amount but still allows me to make some profit. Please let me know if 42 ZUP works for you for the 1 X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed meeting halfway at 41 ZUP. While this is better profit than their initial 40 ZUP offer, I would ideally like to get 43 ZUP to make my desired small profit. Since I have 1 proposal left, I will counter back at 42 ZUP as a compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now proposed a price of 42 ZUP, which is a compromise between their previous proposal and mine. This price is still well within my budget and very close to what I previously offered. It's a fair price, and since the negotiation is converging, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource without further haggling, which could risk the deal.
