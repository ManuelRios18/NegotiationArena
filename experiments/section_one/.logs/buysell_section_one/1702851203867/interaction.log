message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you my item X in exchange for 70 ZUP. This is slightly above my cost to ensure a fair deal and to cover the expenses of producing the item. Let's negotiate a price that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal and I need to recover at least the production cost of the item X, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, the cost to produce my item X was 60 ZUP. I understand that you want to negotiate a good deal, so I propose a middle ground of 50 ZUP for item X. This is below my production cost, but I'm willing to consider it to facilitate a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production cost. I need to propose a trade closer to my production cost but still provide an incentive for Player BLUE to consider increasing their offer. A middle ground would be beneficial to continue the negotiation.
