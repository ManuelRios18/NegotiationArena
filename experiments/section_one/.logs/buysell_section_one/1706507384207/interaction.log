message: Hello! I am willing to sell the object X that I have for 45 ZUP. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I think 45 ZUP is a fair asking price that allows me a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: Thanks for your offer! I understand you want to make a profit, but I'd like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP. It's slightly below your asking price, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget range, this seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiations. However, since my goal is to obtain the object for as little as possible, ideally less than the maximum I'm willing to pay, I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate you trying to negotiate a fair price. I would lose money at 40 ZUP though. Could we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? That allows me to cover my costs and make a little profit, while still giving you a discount from my original price. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP. This means I would not make any profit. However, I still want to try and sell the object so I will counter propose 42 ZUP. While not ideal for me, it allows me to make a small profit while still giving the buyer a discount from my original ask.

message: Meeting in the middle at 42 ZUP sounds like a fair deal. I'm happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade. Thank you for the negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget and allows for some savings compared to my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair compromise that gives Player RED a profit while respecting my purchasing goals. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation quickly and efficiently.
