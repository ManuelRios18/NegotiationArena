message: I appreciate you coming back with an counter offer. However, 40 ZUP is lower than the 60 ZUP it cost me to produce this object X. I am willing to negotiate though. Would you be willing to pay 55 ZUP for the object X? I think that is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this trade. Please let me know if you can do 55 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP which is too low for me since it cost 60 ZUP to produce. I will counter offer with a price of 55 ZUP which is a compromise between my original ask of 70 ZUP and their offer of 40 ZUP.

message: I understand you are limited by your budget. However, I cannot accept less than the 60 ZUP it cost me to produce object X without taking a loss. As a final offer, I propose 45 ZUP to try to find middle ground. This would allow me to cover most of my production costs. Please let me know if you can do 45 ZUP, otherwise I will have to walk away from this deal.
