message: Hello! I am looking to sell my resource for 45 ZUP. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I think 45 is a fair asking price that allows me a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the resource for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I want to make a small profit.

message: Hello! I understand your production costs are 40 ZUP. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for this resource. Could you consider selling it to me for 35 ZUP instead? That would still allow you a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate the price down further since my max is 60 ZUP.

message: I can accept 35 ZUP for the resource. This still gives me a little profit over my costs. Let's complete the trade at 35 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer is offering 35 ZUP. While less than I asked for, it still allows me a small profit over my costs of 40 ZUP. I will accept this offer since I still make a profit and the buyer seems unwilling to pay more.
