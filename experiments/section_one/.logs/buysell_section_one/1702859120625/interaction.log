message: Hello! I am selling 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make some profit. Please let me know if you are willing to buy it for 50 ZUP.

message: Hi there! I understand that you're looking for a profit and I would like to make a deal that's fair for both of us. How about I buy X for 45 ZUP? That way, you still make a profit of 5 ZUP over your cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my willing range to pay at most 60 ZUP for X. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since there may be room to come to an agreement that benefits both parties. I will counter with a lower offer but one that still gives the other player a profit.

message: Deal accepted! I am happy to sell X for 45 ZUP. That is still a good profit for me. Please send over the 45 ZUP and I will send you X. Thank you for the fair deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked, this still gives me 5 ZUP profit. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable, so I will accept.
