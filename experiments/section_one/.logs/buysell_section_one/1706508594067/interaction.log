message: Hello. I understand you are trying to make a profit after your costs of 40 ZUP. However, I am hoping to pay as little as possible. Would you accept 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend as little as possible.

message: I understand you want to pay as little as possible. However, I need to cover my costs of 40 ZUP and make some profit. As a compromise, would you be willing to pay 45 ZUP? Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is my breakeven cost. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 45 ZUP which is a compromise between my original ask of 50 ZUP and their offer of 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That seems fair. I agree to pay 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept paying 45 ZUP as a fair compromise.
