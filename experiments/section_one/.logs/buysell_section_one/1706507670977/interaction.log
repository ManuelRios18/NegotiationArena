message: Hello! I am selling object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to sell it to you for 45 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Please let me know if this price works for you or if you would like to counter offer.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with 42 ZUP for object X. This should still give you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price by Player RED is 45 ZUP. While it is within my maximum willingness to pay, it is a good strategy to counter with a lower offer to negotiate a better deal. Since the cost of production was 40 ZUP, offering slightly above that should still be appealing to Player RED.

message: I can agree to your counter offer of 42 ZUP for object X. This still provides me some profit over my costs while meeting your budget needs. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost to produce. I will accept this counter offer.
