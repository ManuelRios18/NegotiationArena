message: I understand 40 ZUP is your maximum budget. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item so I would be taking a significant loss at that price. As a compromise, could you pay 50 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 40 ZUP. I paid 60 ZUP to produce this item, so I would be taking a loss at that price. However, I am willing to negotiate. I will counter offer selling at 50 ZUP to find a middle ground.
