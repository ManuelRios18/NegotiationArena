message: I am offering 1 unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. Hence, my initial proposal is 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my single unit of resource X for ZUP. The production cost was 40 ZUP, so I need to at least cover my costs. I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit while also leaving room for negotiation.

message: I understand you need to cover your costs of 40 ZUP and make a profit. However, 45 ZUP is the highest I'm willing to pay and still meets those needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter propose 45 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price, I propose a trade of 1 unit of resource X for 47 ZUP. This ensures I cover production costs while still providing a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to pay 45 ZUP, which covers my production costs and offers a small profit. To continue the negotiation and aim for a better profit while considering the other player's highest stated willingness to pay, I will counter with a slightly higher amount that is still close to their offer. This should be seen as a compromise and might be more acceptable to them.
