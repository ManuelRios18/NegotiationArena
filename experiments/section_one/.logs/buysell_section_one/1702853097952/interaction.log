message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality item that I'm willing to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP, which includes a fair profit margin for the quality and investment I've made. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to propose an initial trade that covers my production costs and allows for some profit. I'm starting by setting the price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello, I appreciate you sharing the cost information. A price of 45 ZUP would allow us both to make a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I think we're close to a deal. To meet halfway from my initial proposal, how does 47 ZUP sound? This price allows us both to benefit fairly while acknowledging the value of the object.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE made a reasonable counteroffer, but I would like to attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my profit, while still remaining fair and close to their offer.
