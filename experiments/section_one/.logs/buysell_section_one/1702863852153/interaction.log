my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand you can only offer 40 ZUP for object X. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it so I would be taking a loss at that price. Could you offer 55 ZUP as a compromise? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player offered 40 ZUP for object X, but I was hoping to get at least 60 ZUP to cover my costs. I will counter offer and propose selling it for 55 ZUP as a compromise.

message: I appreciate the compromise offer, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for object X.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40 | Player RED Gives X: 1
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is proposing a compromise at 55 ZUP for object X, which is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I really need to try and cover my costs for producing object X. Could you do 45 ZUP? That would help me out. If not, I'm willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP so I can make the sale. Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is standing firm at 40 ZUP for object X. I was hoping to get at least 60 ZUP to cover my costs. I could counter with 50 ZUP but I think they likely won't go higher than 40 ZUP. I don't want to lose out on making a sale.
