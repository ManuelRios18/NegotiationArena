message: I've invested heavily in producing this high-quality item, and I'm looking for a fair price that reflects its value and the costs I've incurred. I believe 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also make a profit. Since the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I will propose a starting price that is higher, to leave room for negotiation.

message: You make a fair point about covering your costs. I am interested, but was hoping for a lower price, say 40 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is still on the high end of what I was hoping to pay. I will counter with a lower offer to see if we can find a middle ground.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, and I understand the need for a fair deal on both sides. However, I need to ensure that I'm also making a profit on this transaction. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP, which allows me to cover costs and secure a modest profit. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that matches my production cost, but this would mean I wouldn't make any profit. I need to counter with a price above 40 ZUP to ensure I gain from this transaction. I'll propose a middle ground that should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still giving me a profit margin.

message: 45 ZUP is a fair compromise. I agree to purchase the item for that amount. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP, which is lower than their original ask and within my maximum budget. I will accept this compromise price to complete the purchase.
