message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where you receive 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a reasonable profit margin for the production costs incurred. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE. Considering the production costs and the need for a fair profit margin, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This offer splits the difference between our initial proposals and should be a beneficial deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to pay exactly my production costs, which would leave me with no profit. I want to counter with a price that gives me a profit while still being reasonable and hopefully agreeable to Player BLUE.

message: I propose a trade where I receive 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with  ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is still higher than the maximum willing to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counteroffer again to try to reach a more reasonable price.

message: I understand the need to negotiate, but selling below my production cost is not feasible for me. I propose a final compromise of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This ensures I cover my costs and provides you with the resource at a competitive price, reflecting a minimal profit on my end. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to make at least my production cost back, ideally with a profit. I will make a final proposal that meets my minimum cost and adds a small profit margin to incentivize the deal.
