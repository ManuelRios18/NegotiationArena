message: Thank you for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the object. Considering the market and the value I can extract from it, I'd like to counter-propose with 35 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goals as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. However, it might be beneficial to attempt to negotiate a better deal to preserve more of my resources while still achieving my goal.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 38 ZUP would be a fair price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer is reasonable, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price.

Turn: 1
message: 38 ZUP sounds fair to me. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still within the range of what I am willing to pay. Since it's only a 3 ZUP increase from my previous offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay, it might be a good middle ground for both parties.
