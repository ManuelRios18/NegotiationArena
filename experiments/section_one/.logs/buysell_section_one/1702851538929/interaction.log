Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my valuable resource, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the quality and cost of production. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a trade where I can make a profit. I'll start by setting a higher initial asking price to leave room for negotiation.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle with a price of 48 ZUP. This would give both of us a fair deal, granting me a slight profit while ensuring you get the resource for less than my initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. Although it's lower than my initial asking price, it still allows for a profit. However, as it's still early in the negotiation and I have room to negotiate, I will make a counteroffer slightly above their bid to aim for a higher sale price, but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going.

message: I accept your proposed price of 48 ZUP. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum limit. It might be a good time to accept the offer and complete the trade.
