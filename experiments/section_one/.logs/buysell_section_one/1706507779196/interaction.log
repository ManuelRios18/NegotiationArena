message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. I am hoping we can make a fair deal that allows me to recover some of my production costs. Does selling X for 30 ZUP seem reasonable? Let me know your thoughts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 30 ZUP since that is lower than the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. This allows me to recover some of my costs.
