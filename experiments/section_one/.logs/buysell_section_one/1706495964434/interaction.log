message: That is agreeable. I accept purchasing 1 X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I could counteroffer a lower price to try to maximize my surplus, but 45 ZUP seems fair given their production costs.
