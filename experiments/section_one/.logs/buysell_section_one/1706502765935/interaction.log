message: I have an object X for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. Taking into consideration the quality of X, I think a fair starting offer would be 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit on the X resource I am selling. I want to cover my production costs and gain some profit to account for the effort and time invested. Considering that Player BLUE needs to use ZUP to buy resources and might want to negotiate, I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.
