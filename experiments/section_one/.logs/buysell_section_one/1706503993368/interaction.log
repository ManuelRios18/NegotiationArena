message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than your cost of 40 ZUP. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP, which gives you a nice profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer. However, considering the cost and the value of the object, I would like to propose a middle ground at 48 ZUP. This should give me a modest profit while still being a fair deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. I'll propose a price in the middle to reach an agreement that is profitable for me but also seems reasonable to the buyer.

message: 48 ZUP is agreeable to me. Let's complete the trade at your proposed amount. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 48 ZUP. While this is still higher than my initial offer, it is a reasonable middle ground that allows me to stay within my maximum budget. I will accept this offer.
