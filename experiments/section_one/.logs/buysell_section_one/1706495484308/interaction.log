message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X that I have for sale. Based on the production costs, I would like to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this price works for you or if you would like to counter offer.

message: Hello, thanks for the offer. 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling X for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for X, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper if possible since my maximum is 60.

message: I understand you were hoping to pay less. I am willing to come down on my price, but I need to make some profit on the sale. Could you meet in the middle at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP, which is my breakeven price. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter offer 45 ZUP which is halfway between their offer and my original ask.
