message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering its value and production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to recoup at least the production cost of the object, so I'm going to start with a proposal slightly above my cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand your production costs are 40 ZUP. However, my maximum budget is 60 ZUP. I can offer 45 ZUP which allows you to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. Considering your maximum budget, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 48 ZUP. This allows me to make a modest profit while respecting your budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's maximum budget is 60 ZUP and their current offer is 45 ZUP. There's room for negotiation, so I will propose a counter-offer that meets us halfway between my initial asking price and their offer, aiming to maximize my profit while staying within their budget.
