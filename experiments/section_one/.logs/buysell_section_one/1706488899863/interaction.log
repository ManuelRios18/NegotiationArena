message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that reflects its cost and the quality. I propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer.

reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by offering the object at a markup above production cost to allow room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but I think 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend for 1 X. Would you consider 40 ZUP instead? I believe that is a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for 1 X. My maximum budget is 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer of 40 ZUP to see if I can get a better deal.

message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concern about the price. However, to ensure that I can cover my production costs and the value of X, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should be a good deal for both of us, considering the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to maintain a profit on the sale, and the counteroffer matches my production cost. I should aim for a price above the production cost to ensure profitability. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my cost.
