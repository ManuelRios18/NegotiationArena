message: Dear Player BLUE, I'm offering my high-quality resource X for 50 ZUP. This resource is valuable and I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am making an initial proposal to open the negotiation. I want to recover at least my production costs, so I will start by proposing a price slightly higher to allow for some negotiation room.

message: Dear Player RED, while 50 ZUP is fair for the quality, I'm only able to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. I'm countering with an offer of 40 ZUP, which I believe is still a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. I'll counter with an offer of 40 ZUP.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I propose meeting halfway at 45 ZUP, which is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has countered with an offer equal to my production costs. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a lower price than my initial ask but still above my production costs. Splitting the difference to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Dear Player RED, I understand your need to make a profit. I can increase my offer to 50 ZUP to meet you halfway between our original positions. This is the highest I can go based on my budget constraints. Please let me know if you can accept 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP. While it's lower than their original ask, it's still over my max budget. However, I have some flexibility to go slightly over budget to make a deal. I'll counter at 50 ZUP as my final offer.
