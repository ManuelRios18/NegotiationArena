message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Would you consider selling for 40 ZUP instead? That would allow me to save some ZUP while still allowing you to make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: I can accept your offer of 40 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. Thank you for the purchase!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 40 ZUP which is my break even point. I could counter offer 45 ZUP to try to make a small profit, but 40 ZUP allows me to recoup my costs. I will accept the 40 ZUP since I already stated I wanted to make a profit and this covers my costs.
