message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer but it is above what I was hoping to pay. I would be willing to offer 40 ZUP for the object X. Please let me know if you would consider this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since I have a total budget of 100 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I would like to make a small profit. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose 45 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I will counter with a trade that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable.

message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I believe 42 ZUP would be a fair price considering it cost you 40 ZUP to produce. Please let me know if you can agree to sell for 42 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I still think I can get it for cheaper, so I will counter again while trying to close the gap.

message: I agree that 42 ZUP is a fair price. Let's proceed with the trade at your proposed value.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is closer to my production cost, but still provides a marginal profit. It is a reasonable compromise, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly better offer. Accepting this deal ensures a profit and concludes the trade successfully.
