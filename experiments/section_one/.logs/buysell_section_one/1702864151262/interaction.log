message: I understand you have a limited budget. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this object so I cannot sell it at a loss. I could accept 60 ZUP which would allow me to recover my costs. Would you be willing to pay 60 ZUP?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 40 ZUP which is lower than my cost. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter offer with 60 ZUP which is my breakeven point.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 60 ZUP, which is still above the maximum willing to pay of 40 ZUP. Need to counter-offer to reach a mutually acceptable price.
