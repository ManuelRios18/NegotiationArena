message: I have a quality resource X that could be quite valuable to you. I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my production costs and offers a bit of profit. How about 50 ZUP for my resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recoup my production costs and hopefully make a profit. I will propose a price slightly above my costs, anticipating negotiation with the other player.

message: Hi, I am interested in purchasing your resource X. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to offer 40 ZUP, which allows you to cover your costs and make some profit. Let me know if you would accept that price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 40.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that 50 ZUP may be a bit steep, but I also need to make a reasonable profit. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for the resource X. This should give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer meets my production costs but doesn't provide any profit. As this is a negotiation, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above the cost, to try and secure a profit.

message: I appreciate you coming down in your asking price. To compromise further, I can increase my offer to 42 ZUP. This allows you to still make a good profit while keeping the price affordable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum budget. I think there may still be room to negotiate a lower price, so I will counter at 42 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could find common ground. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for my resource X. Looking forward to finalizing our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is closer to my initial asking price and provides me with a profit. While it's not the 45 ZUP I proposed, it still allows me to gain slightly over my production costs. Considering the limited number of proposals I can make, I believe it's a reasonable compromise to secure a deal.
