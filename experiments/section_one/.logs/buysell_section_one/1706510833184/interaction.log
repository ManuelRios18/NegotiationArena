newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.

message: Hello, I am interested in buying your resource X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling it to me for 50 ZUP instead? That would still allow you to make a 10 ZUP profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.
