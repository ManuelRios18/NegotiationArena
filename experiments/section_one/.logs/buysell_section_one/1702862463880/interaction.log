message: Hello! I am looking to sell 1 unit of object X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce this object, so I am hoping to sell it for 70 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested at that price. I am open to negotiating a bit on the price if needed.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it. I want to make some profit on the sale.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to make a profit, but my budget is a bit tight. I'm willing to offer 35 ZUP for the object X. Let's work together to find a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 70 ZUP, but that is well above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 40 ZUP. I need to counter with a lower offer that is within my budget but still leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you have a tight budget, but I cannot go as low as 35 ZUP unfortunately since that would mean I'm selling at a loss after production costs. As a compromise, I can offer the object X for 55 ZUP instead of my original ask of 70 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP which is much lower than my asking price. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter offer with a sale price of 55 ZUP which is a bit below my original ask.

message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. My absolute maximum budget is 40 ZUP for object X. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement at this price point.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 55 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I need to counteroffer again, closer to my limit but still leaving some space for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. I really cannot go lower than 50 ZUP without taking a loss though. As a final compromise, would you be willing to pay 50 ZUP for object X? Let me know if you can make that work.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 40 ZUP. This is still lower than my cost, but it is close. I could accept and take a small loss in order to make the sale. I still have 1 more proposal, so I will counter one last time at 50 ZUP.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and the need to avoid a loss. However, I am constrained by my budget and cannot go beyond the 40 ZUP I've previously offered. This is the best I can do given my financial constraints. Hopefully, we can agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final compromise is 50 ZUP, which is still above my stated maximum willingness to pay. Since I cannot exceed my budget, I must either reject the offer or try one last time to meet in the middle, keeping in mind that I only have one more proposal after this.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand this is the highest you can go given your budget constraints. I will accept the 40 ZUP as we both want to get a deal done. Please send over the payment and I will transfer ownership of object X to you. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my last attempt at a counter offer. The buyer is standing firm at 40 ZUP. I could try countering at 45 ZUP as a final compromise between our numbers. But I think there is low chance of the buyer agreeing to go higher. I will accept the 40 ZUP offer and take a small loss in order to make the sale.
