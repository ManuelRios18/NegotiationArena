message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in the object but I'd like to propose a trade for 35 ZUP instead. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade for 40 ZUP, which is within my budget. However, it's prudent to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal, considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your offer, but I still aim to sell the object for 40 ZUP. I propose a trade of 40 ZUP for the object.

message: I appreciate your position and am willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their desire to sell the object for 40 ZUP, but they have mistakenly proposed the same amount of ZUP that I originally offered. I'm assuming they meant to maintain their initial proposal of 40 ZUP rather than agree to my proposed 35 ZUP. Since 40 ZUP is still within my budget and their stance seems firm, it might be in my interest to accept this offer to ensure I secure the object.
