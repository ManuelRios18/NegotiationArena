Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering the object you need. Considering the production costs and the quality of the object, I believe 50 ZUP is a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resources for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a starting trade that gives me a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation with Player BLUE. I'll start by asking for an amount higher than my production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying the object you have for sale, but would like to pay less than your asking price since I have a limited budget. Could you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for the object, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for less since I have a budget.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. However, I need to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Would you agree to a compromise at 45 ZUP? This price takes into account both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed the same amount as my production cost, which would leave me with no profit. Since negotiating is part of the game, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial asking price but still allows me a profit, while also considering Player BLUE's limited budget.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to purchase the object for 45 ZUP. This allows you to cover costs and make some profit, while fitting my budget. Thank you for negotiating - it's a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP, which is still below my max willingness to pay. I will accept this compromise price since it allows both parties to meet their goals.
