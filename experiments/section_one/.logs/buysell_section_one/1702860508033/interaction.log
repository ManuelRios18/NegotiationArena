message: I understand you are only willing to pay 40 ZUP. However, I paid 60 ZUP to produce X so I would like to try and make back some of that cost. Could we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is only willing to pay 40 ZUP for X. While that is below what I was hoping for, it would still allow me to recoup some of the cost of producing X. I will counterpropose selling it for 50 ZUP as a compromise.

message: Okay, I am willing to accept 40 ZUP for X. I still take a loss at that price compared to my costs but getting some ZUP back is better than none. Please confirm you will purchase X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is firm on only paying 40 ZUP. While that means I will take a loss, getting back some ZUP is better than none if I can't find another buyer. I will accept the 40 ZUP offer.
