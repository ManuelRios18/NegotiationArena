message: Hello! I have 1 object X to sell that I produced at a cost of 40 ZUP. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter propose.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the object X, but I was thinking of a slightly lower price. Would you consider selling it for 47 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate, while still offering a price above their production cost, ensuring they make a profit.

message: I can accept 47 ZUP for the object X. This still allows me to make some profit. Let's complete the trade at 47 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 47 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still profit for me since X cost me 40 ZUP to make. I will accept this.
