message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and make a profit. Are you interested in this offer or would you like to propose a different trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I'm initiating the game with a proposal that seeks to cover my production costs and gain a profit. I'm starting at a higher price expecting negotiations to bring the price down to a mutually agreeable level.

message: Yes, I accept the offer. I will give you 50 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within the budget of 60 ZUP that I am willing to pay. It seems like a fair price based on the cost of production and desired profit.
