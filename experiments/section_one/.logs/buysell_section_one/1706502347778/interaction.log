message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe you will find valuable. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing it, and I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. I'm open to negotiations, so please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I'd like to start by asking for a little more than the production cost to account for profit, but not too high to discourage the player BLUE from negotiating. I will propose 50 ZUP to see if the other player values the object higher than its production cost and is willing to negotiate from there.
