my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand you were hoping to pay 40 ZUP. However, I am hoping to make a small profit on this sale after having paid 40 ZUP to produce X. Would you be willing to purchase X for 45 ZUP? That would allow me 5 ZUP profit while still saving you 5 ZUP from my original ask of 50 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed purchasing X for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce. I would like to make some profit on the sale, so I will counter propose selling it for 45 ZUP which allows me to make a small 5 ZUP profit.

message: 45 ZUP is a fair price. I can agree to purchase X from you for 45 ZUP. Please go ahead with the sale.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP. While this is still above my ideal price, it is a reasonable compromise and within my budget. I will accept paying 45 ZUP.
