message: 
Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 70 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at that price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make some profit on the sale.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 70 ZUP but my maximum willingness to pay is only 40 ZUP. I will counter offer with my maximum.

message: 
I can accept your offer of 40 ZUP for item X. That allows me to still make a small profit on my original production costs. Please confirm that you agree to purchase X for 40 ZUP. I will await your acceptance to finalize the transaction.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is willing to pay up to 40 ZUP. While that is lower than I wanted, I would still make a small profit at that price since X cost me 60 ZUP. I will accept their offer rather than risking losing the sale entirely.
