message: Hello, thank you for the offer! 40 ZUP is closer to what I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since my goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP.

message: I can accept selling X for 40 ZUP. This covers my costs. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 40 ZUP, which is what it originally cost me to produce X. I won't make any profit, but I also won't lose anything by selling at this price. Since I have a limited number of proposals, I think it's best if I accept their offer rather than trying to negotiate further.
