message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and the effort put into producing it. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I need to start by proposing a trade that is higher than my production costs to ensure a profit. However, I should also be reasonable to not discourage the buyer with an excessively high asking price. Hence, I propose a price that is higher than my cost but potentially within a range the buyer might consider.

message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. I can offer 40 ZUP, which allows us both to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60. I will counter with a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a profit to sustain my business. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to reduce my initial asking price to 45 ZUP. This way, we can both benefit from this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer's initial offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure a profit, but it should still be reasonable to keep the negotiation going. I'll propose a price in the middle to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

message: I understand you need to make a profit. 43 ZUP allows you to do that while still staying within my budget. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP. This is closer to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will increase my offer to try to reach an agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding my position. I'm willing to further reduce my price to 44 ZUP, slightly above your offer, ensuring a fair profit for me while respecting your budget constraints. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer, which now allows for a small profit. However, since this is a negotiation and we are close to my production cost, I will propose a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still being considerate of the buyer's budget. This should also leave room for a final adjustment if needed.
