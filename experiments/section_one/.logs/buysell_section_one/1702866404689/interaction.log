message: Hello, I am interested in buying X from you. Your asking price of 45 ZUP is a bit high for me though since my max budget is 60 ZUP. Would you consider selling it to me for 35 ZUP instead? That would allow me to save some ZUP while still allowing you to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to conserve ZUP.

message: I can accept your offer of 35 ZUP for object X. This allows me to make a small profit while working within your budget. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has a max budget of 60 ZUP and is asking to pay 35 ZUP for X. While less than my original ask, this would still allow me to make a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I will accept their offer.
