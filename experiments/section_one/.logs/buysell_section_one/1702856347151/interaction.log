message: I am definitely interested in making a deal. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the object. This would help me manage my resources better while still providing you with a fair price for your object. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my acceptable range. However, it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, aiming to conserve some of my ZUP for future transactions or other needs. I will make a counter-offer that is lower than the asking price but still reasonable enough that Player RED might consider it.
