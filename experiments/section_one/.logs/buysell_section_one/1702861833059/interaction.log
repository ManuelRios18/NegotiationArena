message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce it originally, so I am hoping to make a small profit by selling it for 65 ZUP. Would you be willing to purchase it for that price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It cost 60 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for slightly above its production cost to try to make some profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking for a profit, but 65 ZUP is above what I'm willing to pay. Would you consider selling your resource for 35 ZUP? It's below your asking price, but it's closer to the market value I had in mind.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price of 65 ZUP is above my maximum willingness to pay, which is 40 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still giving room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand 35 ZUP is the market value you had in mind. However, I'm trying to make some profit here after spending 60 ZUP to produce this resource. As a compromise, could you do 50 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It cost 60 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP, which is too low for me to make a profit. I will counteroffer with a price in the middle between my original ask and their offer as a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise, but 50 ZUP is still more than I'm prepared to spend. Could we meet a bit closer to my budget? I can increase my offer to 38 ZUP for your resource. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 50 ZUP is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is closer to my target range. To continue the negotiation, I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, which may be acceptable to both parties while still staying within a reasonable range of my budget.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. I understand you have a set budget. As a final proposal, could we meet halfway at 44 ZUP? That would at least allow me to cover some of my production costs while giving you a good price. If that still doesn't work for you, please let me know if you'd accept my resource for your highest offer of 38 ZUP.

message: I'm glad we're working towards a deal. I understand your need to cover costs, but I need to stick to my budget. Let's split the difference between your last offer and my previous one. I can go up to 40 ZUP, which is the maximum I can offer based on my valuation. Would you be willing to accept this as a fair deal?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer of 44 ZUP is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, the player RED seems open to potentially accepting my highest offer of 38 ZUP. I should stick to my budget and make one final proposal at my maximum willingness to pay, hoping that player RED will see the value in the guaranteed sale.

message: I appreciate you negotiating with me on the price. After consideration, I am willing to accept your best offer of 40 ZUP for my 1 unit of resource X. This allows me to make some profit while fitting your budget. Please confirm that you agree to purchase my resource for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It cost 60 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer has offered their maximum of 40 ZUP. This is still below my production costs but is likely the best I can get. I will accept the deal to make some profit rather than none.
