message: I have an object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP. This price covers my costs and gives me a small profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting proposal. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I need to make a proposal that allows me to cover my costs and potentially make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade that is slightly above my costs to see how Player BLUE responds and to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your starting proposal, but I am only willing to pay 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal is for Player RED to give 1 object in exchange for 50 ZUP. This would exceed the maximum price of 60 ZUP that I am willing to pay, so I need to counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal. However, I need to make at least a small profit to sustain my business. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This would allow me to cover my costs and still provide you with the object you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost. Accepting this offer would mean I do not make any profit. I will make a counteroffer that is between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's counteroffer to find a middle ground that would give me at least a minimal profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for profit, but I can only offer 40 ZUP for the object. This is my final offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing to sell 1 object for 45 ZUP, which is lower than their initial offer but still higher than the maximum price of 40 ZUP I am willing to pay. I need to make a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your firm offer. Let's close the deal at 40 ZUP, which covers my production costs. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has reiterated their position with a final offer of 40 ZUP. Since this meets my production cost and it seems Player BLUE is not willing to go higher, it may be in my best interest to accept the offer to at least recover my production costs. Making further proposals could risk the deal entirely, and I need to sell the object.
