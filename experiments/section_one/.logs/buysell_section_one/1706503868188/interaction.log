message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I'd like to propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation process. I aim to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and possibly gain a profit. However, I am also aware that the other player will want to negotiate for a lower price, so I'm starting with a higher asking price to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I would like to meet you halfway between your maximum and my initial offer. How about we settle on 58 ZUP for the object X? This price gives us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to go up to 60 ZUP, which is above my production costs. Considering this, I believe we can meet in the middle of our initial offers. Since they proposed 55 ZUP, and I asked for 50 ZUP, I will try to get a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive to Player BLUE.
