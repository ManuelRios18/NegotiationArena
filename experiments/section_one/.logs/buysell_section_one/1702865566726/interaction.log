message: I understand 40 ZUP is your maximum budget. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce X so I would be taking a loss at that price. Could we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is only willing to pay 40 ZUP, which is below my costs. However, I should try to make a deal within their budget if possible. I will counter propose selling for 50 ZUP to try to find a middle ground.

message: I can accept 45 ZUP for X. While less than I was hoping for, I understand that is your highest offer and I agree to make the sale. Please transfer 45 ZUP and I will send you X. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has increased their offer to 45 ZUP. While this is still below my costs, it is likely the highest they can pay. Getting 45 ZUP is better than not making a sale at all, so I will accept.
