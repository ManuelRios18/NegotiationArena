message: Thank you for your offer! I understand that you're looking to make a profit on your sale. However, I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of object X. This is above your cost, ensuring you make a profit while keeping the purchase within my budget. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of object X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP, but it's always good to negotiate for a better price, especially since the seller's cost is 40 ZUP and they are looking for a profit. I will try to propose a lower price that is closer to their cost, but still allows for a profit, with the aim of meeting halfway.

message: I can accept your offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a bit of profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make a small profit of 5 ZUP over my costs. I think this is a reasonable compromise.
