Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object that I'm sure will be valuable to you. Let's start the negotiations at 50 ZUP for this item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that covers my production costs and allows for a profit. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP for the object, I will start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in purchasing the item, but your initial asking price of 50 ZUP is higher than I was hoping to pay. I can offer 30 ZUP, which allows me some margin to potentially increase my offer later if needed to reach a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's opening offer of 50 ZUP is too high compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but the cost of production was 40 ZUP, and I need to ensure a fair profit margin for the quality of the object. How about we meet closer to the middle at 45 ZUP? This should give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs. I want to make a profit, but I also need to cover my costs. I should counter with a price that is above my production costs but less than my initial proposal to move the negotiation forward.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand you need to make a fair profit. Getting closer to 40 ZUP would work well for me. Perhaps we could settle in the middle at 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 45 ZUP. While still higher than my initial offer, 45 is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will try countering at 40 ZUP to see if we can agree closer to my original price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Meeting in the middle sounds like a reasonable plan. I can agree to a slight reduction from my last proposal. How about we settle at 43 ZUP? This price allows me to make a modest profit and should be agreeable for you as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 40 ZUP covers my production costs but does not provide a profit. I would like to propose a slight increase to ensure a profit while still being fair to Player BLUE's request to get closer to 40 ZUP. I will aim slightly above the proposed 42 ZUP to give room for final negotiation.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 43 ZUP is agreeable to me. I accept your offer and we have a deal. Thank you for negotiating reasonably to find a fair price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 43 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. At this point getting the deal done is worth more than trying to squeeze out another couple ZUP, so I will accept.
