Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have the object you're interested in. Considering the production costs and the quality of the item, I propose a fair trade for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least my production costs, so I will start by proposing a trade that includes a small profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying the object, but 50 ZUP seems too high. I can offer 40 ZUP, which should still give you a good profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since I have more ZUP to spare. I will counteroffer with 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling at cost doesn't account for the effort and time invested. I believe that meeting halfway between our offers at 45 ZUP would be mutually beneficial and fair.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is exactly my production cost, which does not account for any profit. I need to propose a counteroffer that would give me some profit while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP seems reasonable. I accept your offer and agree to trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this offer since it seems fair considering the seller's costs and effort.
