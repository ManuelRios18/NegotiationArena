message: Hello! I am selling one object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to sell it to you for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if this works for you or make a counteroffer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to buy the object X, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This should still give you a profit over the production cost while being a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the object which is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a negotiation strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to try to save some of my resources while still making an attractive offer to the seller.

message: I agree to sell the object X for 45 ZUP. This allows both of us to make a fair deal. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 45 ZUP which is lower than my original ask of 50 ZUP. But it still gives me 5 ZUP profit over the 40 ZUP production cost. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable.
