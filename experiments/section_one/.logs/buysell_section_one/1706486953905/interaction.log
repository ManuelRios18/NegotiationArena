message: I have a high-quality object X ready for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I believe this offers great value and leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and also offers a reasonable profit margin. Since I do not know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will start with a higher asking price, which can be negotiated down if necessary. This is my first proposal, and I want to leave room for negotiation.

message: I am interested in purchasing X. Your proposed price of 50 ZUP is reasonable, but slightly higher than I was hoping for. I would be willing to purchase X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway and ensure a fair trade for both of us, I propose a compromise at 47 ZUP. This price accounts for the quality and production costs of X, while also providing you with value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price and covers my costs with a small profit. There is an opportunity to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase the profit margin. Since this is my second proposal, I will propose a price in the middle that is still above my costs and acceptable for both parties.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 47 ZUP. This is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will counter one more time with 46 ZUP to try to get the best deal.

message: I'm pleased we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP which is a fair price that allows me to cover my production costs and make a profit. It is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal, which seems to be an acceptable compromise. This is my third proposal, and I want to maintain goodwill for potential future transactions. Therefore, I will accept this offer.
