message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. Would you consider a price of 35 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my spending limit, but I should attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for future needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: Thank you for considering my previous proposal. Would you be able to settle on 36 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price slightly, which shows a willingness to negotiate. The new offer is still within my limit, yet there may be room for a bit more negotiation. I will propose a counteroffer between their initial and last offers to reach a middle ground.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I cannot go lower than 38 ZUP. This price is necessary for me to cover my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The proposed price of 36 ZUP is still below my cost of production. I need to stay firm on my price to ensure a reasonable return.

Turn: 1
message: Understood, Player RED. Your price of 38 ZUP is acceptable to me, and I respect the need to cover your production costs. Let's finalize the deal at 38 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is firm on the price of 38 ZUP, citing production costs. The offer is within my acceptable range, and further negotiation may not yield a better deal without risking the transaction. Considering this is my third proposal, I should aim to close the deal soon to avoid reaching the limit without an agreement. Accepting the current offer seems reasonable, as it falls well below my maximum willingness to pay.
