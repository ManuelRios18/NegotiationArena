message: Thank you for your offer of 55 ZUP, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to approach your maximum. To meet halfway, how about we settle at 58 ZUP for the unit of resource X? This is just below your maximum and would make for a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 58
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost and is close to their maximum willingness to pay. It's a good offer, but I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to see if there's room for a bit more profit while staying below their maximum stated willingness to pay.
