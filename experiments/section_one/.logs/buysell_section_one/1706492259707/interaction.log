message: I am interested in buying the object X. 40 ZUP seems a bit high. Would you consider selling it for 50 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has proposed to sell the object X for 40 ZUP. This is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, so it could be a good deal to accept. However, I still have 3 more chances to propose a counteroffer before needing to accept or reject. I will try proposing 50 ZUP first to see if I can get it cheaper.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has countered my offer and proposed to sell the object for 45 ZUP instead of 40 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay. I could accept this deal since it meets my goals. However, I still have 2 more chances to propose a counteroffer. I will try proposing 42 ZUP to see if they will agree to go a bit lower.
