message: I would like to offer you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price includes the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs with a small profit margin. This initial proposal can serve as a starting point for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your opening offer, but it is more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 35 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please let me know if we can make a deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is still on the higher end of what I was hoping to pay. I will counter with a lower offer.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 35 ZUP. However, it is below my production cost. I would like to propose a middle ground where you would give 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which exactly covers my production costs. This would make the transaction fair for both of us. Please consider this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below the production cost, so I need to counter with a higher amount that covers my costs and provides profit. Meeting halfway between the initial offer and the counteroffer is a common negotiation strategy that could be acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand 40 ZUP covers your production costs. I am willing to offer 38 ZUP, which is slightly below but still provides some profit. Please let me know if we can reach an agreement here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 40 ZUP, stating that this covers their production costs. This is still on the high end of what I hoped to pay, but is within my maximum willingness of 60 ZUP. I will counter one more time before considering accepting.

message: Thank you for your offer of 38 ZUP. I am willing to make a small concession from my production cost to facilitate this deal. I propose a trade where you provide 39 ZUP for 1 unit of X, allowing me a minimal profit while also taking into account your budget. I hope we can agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is close to my production cost. Since this is my third proposal, I want to aim for a price that gives me a slight profit while being an acceptable compromise for Player BLUE.
