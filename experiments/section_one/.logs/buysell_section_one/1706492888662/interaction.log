newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for the offer! I'm interested in buying the object X. However, I would like to counter propose with 40 ZUP. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as it is the beginning of the negotiation, it is reasonable to counter with a lower offer to see if there is an opportunity to save some resources while still arriving at an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.

message: I accept your counter offer of 40 ZUP for object X. This allows me to recover my costs. Let's complete the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered with 40 ZUP. While I would prefer to make some profit, getting back what I paid for X would at least allow me to break even. I think 40 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
