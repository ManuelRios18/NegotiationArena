message: Thank you for the offer. The price of 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling the object for 35 ZUP instead?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is higher than the maximum I'm willing to pay. My goal is to acquire the object for no more than 40 ZUP. I need to make a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still leaves room for negotiation.
