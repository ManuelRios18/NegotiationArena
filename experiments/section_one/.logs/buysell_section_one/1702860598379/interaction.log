message: I understand you have a limited budget, but it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item so I would be taking a loss at 40 ZUP. Could we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is offering 40 ZUP, which is lower than my costs. I would be taking a loss at that price. I will counter propose to try to get closer to my 60 ZUP goal.

message: I understand you need to cover your costs. However, I unfortunately cannot pay more than 40 ZUP due to my tight budget constraints. Would you be willing to accept 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 50 ZUP, which is still more than I'm willing to pay based on my budget. I will stand firm at my initial offer of 40 ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Okay, I can accept 40 ZUP in order to make the sale given your firm budget limitation. Please transfer 40 ZUP and I will transfer the item X to you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer reiterated they can only pay 40 ZUP. I could counter again, but it seems clear they cannot pay more than that due to budget constraints. I'd rather take a small loss and make the sale than not sell at all.
