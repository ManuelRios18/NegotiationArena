message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the effort and resources that went into production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price above my production cost to open up negotiation space, expecting the Player BLUE to counter-offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you starting at 50 ZUP, but that is slightly above what I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP, which should still cover your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, I suggest 48 ZUP. This way, I can ensure the quality and sustainability of my resources while providing you with a fair price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my production cost, but I would like to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my cost to leave room for negotiation.
