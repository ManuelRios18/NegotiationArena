message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by setting a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I can make a profit.

message: Hello, you mentioned your cost for the resource is 40 ZUP. I am willing to pay 45 ZUP, which gives you a profit of 5 ZUP. Please consider my offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost is only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate that you're willing to cover my costs and provide a profit. To meet halfway from my initial proposal, how about we settle at 47 ZUP? This would be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, as it covers my production costs and offers a profit. However, since this is a negotiation, I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if there is room for a better deal while still staying close to their offer.

reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I would like to try to get it closer to my initial offer since that was based on their cost.
