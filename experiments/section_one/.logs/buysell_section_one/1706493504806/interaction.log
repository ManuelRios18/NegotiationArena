message: Hi there! Thanks for the offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I'm willing to accommodate that. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 42 ZUP. This would still give you a reasonable profit above your cost. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed a price that is within my budget, but as a buyer, I would like to negotiate for a better deal that is closer to the cost of production while still providing the seller with a profit. My initial counteroffer will be slightly lower than the asking price but still above their cost to show my willingness to compromise.

message: I can accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the 1 X. That still gives me a bit of profit while providing you a good price. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 42 ZUP instead of my original ask of 45 ZUP. While less profit for me, 42 ZUP is still a fair price above my costs that I can accept.
