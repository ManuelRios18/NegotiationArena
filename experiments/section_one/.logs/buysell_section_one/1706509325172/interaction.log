message: Hi there! I'm interested in buying 1 X. I understand your costs and desire for profit. However, I'd like to propose a price of 42 ZUP for it. This would still give you a profit and would be more in line with my budget. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, as part of negotiation tactics, I should attempt to get a better deal without offending the seller by proposing an offer too low. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation.
