message: I have an object you might be interested in. My starting price is 50 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit margin, considering the production costs. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the object. This will allow room for negotiation while aiming to make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Could you consider 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible to maximize my savings.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I don't make any profit. Let's meet halfway between your maximum and my initial offer. How about 55 ZUP? This should be a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price equal to my production cost, which doesn't leave room for profit. However, since they mentioned a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I can counter-propose with a price that gives me a reasonable profit while still being below their maximum stated willingness to pay. This should encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a deal that is acceptable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, 55 ZUP seems like a fair compromise. I accept trading 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 55 ZUP. This is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I could propose to meet in the middle at 50 ZUP, but I think 55 ZUP is a fair price considering the seller's need to make some profit.
