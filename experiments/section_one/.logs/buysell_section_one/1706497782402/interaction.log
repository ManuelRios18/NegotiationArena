message: Hello! I am interested in buying the object X. However, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. Since it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, would you accept 40 ZUP for it? That would allow you to cover your costs without taking a loss.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

Hi, I appreciate you wanting to cover my production costs, but I would like to make at least a small profit on this sale. Could you meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? That is halfway between my asking price and your offer. Please let me know if that works for you!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay 40 ZUP for X. This would cover my production costs but I wouldn't make any profit. I would like to make at least a small profit. Let me counter offer 45 ZUP which is halfway between my original asking price and their offer.
