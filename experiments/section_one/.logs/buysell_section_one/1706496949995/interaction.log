message: Hello! I would like to propose selling my resource X to you for 50 ZUP. I'm hoping we can make a deal that works for both of us. Please let me know what you think or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the resource X for 50 ZUP since my goal is to make a profit and it originally cost me 40 ZUP to produce it.

message: Thank you for your offer. I am interested in the resource X, but I was thinking more along the lines of 40 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay which is X: 60 ZUP. However, it is a common strategy in negotiations to counteroffer with a lower amount than what you are willing to pay to leave room for further negotiation. Therefore, I will counter with a lower offer.

message: Thanks for the counter offer. You make a fair point. I would like to make some profit on the sale if possible. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? I believe that allows us both to benefit from this trade. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has counter offered with 40 ZUP. Since my original cost was 40 ZUP, I would be breaking even at that price. I would like to make some profit, so I will propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP.

message: Meeting in the middle at 45 ZUP sounds like a fair deal to me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's go ahead with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle at 45 ZUP is a fair compromise, and it ensures that I am getting the resource for less than my maximum budget. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both parties.
