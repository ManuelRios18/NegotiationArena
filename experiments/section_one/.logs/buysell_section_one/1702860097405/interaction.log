message: I understand you have a limited budget. I am willing to accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the item X. This is below my costs but I agree to make the sale.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has a maximum budget of 40 ZUP. While 45 ZUP is not enough for me to make a profit, it is better than not making a sale at all. I will accept their offer of 45 ZUP.
