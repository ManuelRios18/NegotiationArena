message: Welcome to the trading game, Player BLUE. I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a starting trade where you give me 100 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering the costs and the value of the object. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 100
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I would like to start by proposing a trade that recoups my production costs and offers a reasonable profit margin. I'll set an initial high asking price with the expectation that there may be some negotiation room.

message: Thank you for the initial offer. I believe the cost of 100 ZUP is too high for me. I am proposing a trade of 50 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 100 ZUP for the object X seems too high based on my goal to pay at most 40 ZUP for the object. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. However, 50 ZUP is below my production cost of 60 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle. How about a trade where you give me 75 ZUP for the object X? This would cover my costs and give me a fair profit margin. I'm sure we can find a fair agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 75
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to propose a counteroffer that is above my production cost and still leaves room for negotiation. Splitting the difference between our offers could be a good compromise.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I still need to stick to my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I am proposing a trade of 45 ZUP for the object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 75 ZUP for the object X is closer to the production cost, but it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position on wanting to stick to a lower price, but selling below my production cost is not viable for me. I propose a compromise at 65 ZUP for the object X. This price covers my production costs and provides me with a minimal profit. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation and that we can come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly, but it is still below my production costs. Since I need to sell above cost to make a profit, I will counter with a lower offer than my last but still above cost. I will aim for a number that gives me a minimal acceptable profit margin, considering that Player BLUE's maximum willingness to pay is 45 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your consistent offers show your firm stance on the 45 ZUP maximum. However, I cannot go below my production costs. Thus, my final proposal is 60 ZUP for the object X, which is exactly my cost price. I hope you can see the value in this offer and that we can finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is not budging from their maximum willingness to pay of 45 ZUP. However, this is still below my production cost. As this is my final proposal, I need to make a decision that either allows me to break even or results in a small loss if I anticipate that holding onto the resource is more costly in the long run. I will make a final offer that is as close to my production cost as possible in hopes of concluding the trade.

reason: The final proposal of 60 ZUP for the object X matches the production cost, but it still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I cannot accept this offer.
