message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of X for 45 ZUP. This covers my production costs and includes a small profit margin. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and offers a bit of profit. However, I need to leave room for negotiation, so I won't start with too high of an amount.

message: Hello, 45 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I can offer 35 ZUP, which allows you to cover costs and make some profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is lower than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price if possible since 45 ZUP is still a significant amount of my resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, 35 ZUP doesn't cover my production costs. I've adjusted my proposal to 40 ZUP, which exactly matches my cost. I believe this is a fair compromise and ensures that I'm not operating at a loss.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE doesn't cover my production costs, which are 40 ZUP. I want to propose a trade that at least covers my costs and includes a profit margin. I'll suggest a compromise that is halfway between my initial proposal and their counteroffer.

message: I understand 40 ZUP covers your costs. I could offer 38 ZUP, allowing you to still make a small profit while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their asking price to 40 ZUP, which equals their production costs. This is still a bit higher than I was hoping for. I could offer 38 ZUP to see if they will accept a small profit margin.

message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. I appreciate your offer of 38 ZUP, but to ensure I'm not at a loss, my final proposal is 39 ZUP. This just covers my costs with a very minimal profit. I hope we can agree on this and close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is below my production costs, but it is close. Considering it's important to make a sale, I will accept a smaller profit to ensure the deal goes through. I will make a final proposal that slightly increases their offer to cover my costs and provide a minimal profit, emphasizing this is my final proposal before accepting or rejecting.

message: 39 ZUP is agreeable to me. Thank you for negotiating reasonably. Let's close the deal at your last proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 39 ZUP, which allows them to cover costs and make a small profit. This is very close to my ideal price, and still under my max willingness to pay. I think this is a fair deal.
