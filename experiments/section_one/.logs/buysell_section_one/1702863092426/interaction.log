message: Hello! I have one object X available for sale. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Hi there! I am interested in the object X. The price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. Would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP? Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a negotiating tactic, I would like to propose a slightly lower offer to see if I can save some ZUP while still closing the deal. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a better outcome for me.

message: I can accept your counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Please send payment and I will transfer the object to you. Thank you for doing business!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered my original offer and proposed to pay 45 ZUP instead of 50 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, 45 ZUP would still give me a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I will accept this counteroffer.
