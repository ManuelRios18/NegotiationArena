message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which has cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value and propose a fair price of 70 ZUP for it. Let me know if you're interested in this offer or if you have a counter-proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit from the sale of my object X. Since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost to open up room for negotiation and to cover potential bargaining by Player BLUE.
