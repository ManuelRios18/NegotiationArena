message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I am hoping to sell it for a small profit margin. Would you be willing to purchase X for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for slightly above its production cost, at 50 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! I understand you want to make a profit on the item, and I'm willing to pay for it, but I'd like to counteroffer 45 ZUP. This is slightly above what it cost you to produce, and it allows for a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate the price down closer to my maximum willing payment which is 60 ZUP, but I need to make a counteroffer that is lower to leave room for negotiation. Starting with a counter below my maximum willingness gives me leverage for further negotiation.

message: I agree, 45 ZUP seems fair. I accept your counteroffer - please send me 45 ZUP and I will send you the item X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make a small 5 ZUP profit. I will accept this trade since it achieves my goal of making some profit.
