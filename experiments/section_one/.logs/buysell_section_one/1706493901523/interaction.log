message: Thank you for your offer. While I understand the need for profit, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure that the deal is within my budget. I believe this is a fair counter offer that still allows for your profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counter proposal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but it is close to my maximum limit. I will propose a slightly lower amount to begin the negotiation, aiming to get a better deal while leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I can accept selling the 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This still provides some profit for me. Please confirm that you agree to purchase 1 X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make 5 ZUP profit. I think this is reasonable for both parties.
