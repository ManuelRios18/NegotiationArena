message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing the object for 40 ZUP? It's the cost I incurred to produce it, so I hope we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to sell the object for 40 ZUP. This is the cost I incurred to produce the resources, so it would be ideal to sell it at this price.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to counter with 35 ZUP for the object. This is a bit closer to the value I had in mind. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, which is a maximum of 60 ZUP for the object. However, since this is a negotiation, I would like to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to see if there is room for a better deal.

message: I understand your counter offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a trade at 37 ZUP, which is halfway between our initial offers. Hopefully, this can be acceptable to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter offer of 35 ZUP is lower than my production cost, but I'm open to negotiation. I will propose a trade at 37 ZUP to meet halfway.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 37 ZUP, which is still within my budget. It's closer to my initial counteroffer and is a reasonable middle ground. Since the proposed price is within my willingness to pay and only 2 ZUP above my counteroffer, it seems fair to accept this proposal and close the deal.
