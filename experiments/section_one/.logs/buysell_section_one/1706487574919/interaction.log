message: I have a quality product that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the quality and the cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I want to propose a starting price that gives me a profit, but also leaves room for negotiation, knowing that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate the price down. Therefore, I will start by proposing a price that is above my production cost.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is starting at 50 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 45 ZUP to try to get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. Meeting halfway is a good idea. How about we settle at 48 ZUP? This gives you a discount from my initial asking price while still respecting the value of the product.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I initially asked for 50 ZUP. Since they seem willing to negotiate and suggested meeting in the middle, I am inclined to compromise slightly but still aim for a price above their offer to maintain a negotiation advantage. I will propose a price slightly below my initial asking price but above their offer to find a mutually agreeable middle ground.
