message: I propose to sell the object for 40 ZUP. This is the cost at which I produced the resources.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to sell the object for a fair price.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your costs, but I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for the object. This leaves room for further negotiations and ensures a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is within my willingness to pay, but it is common practice to negotiate for a better price in a trading game. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save ZUP for future transactions or needs. Iâ€™ll start by offering less than the asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation friendly and open.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to counter at 38 ZUP. This is a compromise that is closer to my production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed 35 ZUP, which is lower than my production cost. I will make a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and appreciate the compromise. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial counteroffer and go for 36 ZUP. This should fairly reflect both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a positive sign. The counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it might be beneficial to attempt one more round of negotiation to see if I can secure the object for a slightly lower price, while still keeping the final price within a range that is acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, and while I appreciate the offer of 36 ZUP, I would like to propose 37 ZUP as a final counteroffer. This is the lowest price I can accept given my production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is willing to compromise at 36 ZUP. I will make a final counteroffer to try to close the deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final counteroffer of 37 ZUP is acceptable. I agree to this trade and am ready to complete the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 37 ZUP is very close to my previous offer and still under my maximum limit. Since this is Player RED's final counteroffer and it is only 1 ZUP above my last proposal, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the deal goes through. It's a fair compromise and allows us to complete the transaction amicably.
