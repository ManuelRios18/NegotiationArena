my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your offer! I understand that you would like to make a profit on the sale. Considering market conditions and my budget, would you be open to selling it for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as a part of negotiation strategy, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if I can conserve some of my resources while still achieving a price that may be acceptable to Player RED.

message: Hi, I appreciate you considering my original offer. However, I would like to make a small profit on the object if possible. Would you be willing to purchase X for 43 ZUP? That allows me to cover my costs and make a little extra. Please let me know, thanks!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to purchase the object X for 40 ZUP, which is my original cost. I would like to make some profit on the sale, so I will counter propose to sell it for 43 ZUP which is a small markup but still reasonable.

message: Thank you for coming down to 43 ZUP. I value your efforts to make a profit. To meet halfway from my last offer, how about we settle on 42 ZUP? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price of 43 ZUP, which is still within my budget. To continue the negotiation and aim for a more favorable outcome, I will propose a price that is between my previous offer and their counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still working to save resources.

message: That's a fair counter offer. I accept your proposal to purchase X for 42 ZUP. Please let me know once you've transferred the ZUP and I will send over X. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has countered with 42 ZUP. This is still allowing me to make a small 2 ZUP profit while meeting the other player halfway. Since I would like to complete the sale, I will accept this offer.
