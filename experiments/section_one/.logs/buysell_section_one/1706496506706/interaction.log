message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am hoping to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested at this price or would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will propose higher than the production cost to try to make a small profit.

message: Hello! I understand you're looking for a profit, but I was hoping we could find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about 40 ZUP for the item? This should cover your costs and still give you some profit while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal since the initial asking price is close to the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. I'll propose a lower price to leave room for negotiation but still keep it reasonable and above their cost of production to respect their need for profit.

message: I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. Getting just my costs covered doesn't work for me, but I'm willing to come down a little on my price. Could you do 43 ZUP? That would give me a small profit while still being under my original ask. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP which would just cover my costs but not provide any profit. I would like to try to get some profit, so I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

message: Thank you for considering a lower price. While I understand your need for profit, I'm looking to reach a fair compromise for both of us. Would 42 ZUP be acceptable for you? It's a bit above the cost of production and still provides you with a profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 43 ZUP is closer to what I am willing to pay, but it's still above the midpoint between our initial proposals. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer to show my willingness to compromise and to edge closer to an acceptable middle ground for both parties.

message: 42 ZUP works for me. I appreciate you negotiating to find a fair price that provides me some profit while meeting your budget. Let's complete the trade at 42 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 42 ZUP. While slightly less than I proposed, this would still give me a small profit over my costs. I think 42 ZUP is reasonable for both sides so I will accept.
