message: Hello! I am selling object X that I produced for 40 ZUP. I would like to sell it to you for 50 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested or would like to negotiate on the price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in buying the object, but I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP. This would still give you a profit above your production cost while being within my budget. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP and the seller's production cost is 40 ZUP, offering 45 ZUP would provide the seller with a profit while still being below my maximum price. This allows room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I accept your counter-offer of 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter-offered 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a 5 ZUP profit. I will accept this offer since it meets my goal of covering costs plus some profit.
