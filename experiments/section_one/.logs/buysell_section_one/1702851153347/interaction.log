Turn: 0
message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade for 70 ZUP, giving me a slight profit and ensuring I cover production costs. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point for the negotiations, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and potentially make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sorry, but I can't agree to that price. It's beyond what I'm willing to pay for X.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 60 ZUP is already over your budget for X, and paying 70 ZUP for one unit would exceed your limit.
