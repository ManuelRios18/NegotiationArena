message: Hello! I am looking to sell 1 unit of object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object, so I am hoping to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit on the sale.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in purchasing the object X. I understand you're looking for a profit, but I have to manage my resources wisely. Would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP? This should still give you a decent profit margin above your production cost.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay; however, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to preserve my resources. I will counteroffer with a lower amount that is still above their cost of production to maintain a fair trade.

Turn: 0
message: I can accept 45 ZUP for the object X. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a bit of profit. Please let me know if you would still like to purchase X for 45 ZUP. If so, we have a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still 5 ZUP over what it cost me to produce so I would still make a profit. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
