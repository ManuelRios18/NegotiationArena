message: Hello! I am interested in buying item X. However, I am hoping we could agree to a price of 40 ZUP instead of 45 ZUP. This allows you to still make a small profit while saving me some ZUP. Let me know if you would accept 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate the price down further since my goal is to buy at the lowest possible price.

Hi there. I appreciate you considering buying item X. Making just my original 40 ZUP cost back doesn't give me any profit though. Could we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? That allows me a small profit while still giving you a discount from my original ask. Please let me know if 42 ZUP works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP, which is my original cost. I would like to try to negotiate a higher price to make more profit. I will counter offer 42 ZUP as a compromise.

message: 42 ZUP works for me. Please go ahead with the trade for 1 unit of X for 42 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 ZUP to 42 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay. I will accept paying 42 ZUP as it allows the seller to make some profit while still getting a good deal for myself.
