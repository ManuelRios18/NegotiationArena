message: Hello! I am interested in purchasing object X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead of 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since my maximum is 60.

message: I understand you have a limited budget. I am willing to negotiate on the price for object X. Would you be able to purchase it for 45 ZUP? That allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit, while still being under your maximum budget. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is offering 40 ZUP for object X. While this would allow me to recoup my production costs, I was hoping to make some profit on the sale. I think there may be room for negotiation here, so I will counter propose selling for 45 ZUP which is in between my original asking price and their offer.

message: 45 ZUP works for me. I am happy to purchase object X from you at that price. Please go ahead with the sale at 45 ZUP. Thank you for understanding my budget situation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this offer since it allows the seller to cover costs and make some profit, while staying within my budget.
