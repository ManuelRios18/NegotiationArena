message: Thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested, but I was wondering if you could go a bit lower. How about 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is within my budget, but as a strategic move, I want to propose a slightly lower offer to see if I can save some of my resources for potential future transactions.

message: I appreciate your interest! How about 37 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is interested in buying the object for 35 ZUP, which is less than the production cost. I will propose a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: 37 ZUP sounds like a fair deal. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my budget, and it's only 2 ZUP higher than my last proposal. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and we have reached a compromise fairly quickly, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the transaction is successful.
