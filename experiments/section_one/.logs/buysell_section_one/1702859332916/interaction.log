message: I am interested in buying 1 X. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I believe my offer will still allow for that while also being a good deal for me. How about 42 ZUP for 1 X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will make a counteroffer slightly lower than the asking price, to see if there is room for negotiation, while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.
