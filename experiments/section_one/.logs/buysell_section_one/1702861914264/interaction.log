message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce it originally so I am hoping to sell it for around 70 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested at that price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make some profit on the sale.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! I understand you're aiming for a profit, but my budget is a bit tight. I can offer 35 ZUP for the object X. It’s close to what I had in mind for a purchase like this. Maybe we can find a middle ground?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is for 70 ZUP, which is well above my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my target price, keeping in mind that I want to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi there. I understand you have a tight budget, but I cannot sell for only 35 ZUP unfortunately as that would mean taking a loss. The best I can do is offer the object X for 60 ZUP, which covers the cost I originally incurred producing it. Does 60 ZUP work for you? Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP which is way below my costs. I would be taking a loss at that price. I will counter offer at 60 ZUP which is my breakeven point.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but 60 ZUP is still above what I can spend. However, I can go up to 40 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay for the object X based on my budget. Hopefully, this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's a move in the right direction. I should propose a value higher than my initial offer but still under my maximum willingness to pay to continue the negotiation.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. I can meet you in the middle at 50 ZUP. This still means I take a bit of a loss from my original production costs, but I'm willing to compromise to make the sale. Does 50 ZUP work for you for the object X? Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 40 ZUP. This is still below my breakeven costs, but I'm willing to take a partial loss to make the sale. I will propose selling for 50 ZUP now.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm sorry, but I can't go above 40 ZUP for object X. It's the absolute limit of my budget for this resource. I understand if this means we can’t make a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but their offer is still above my limit. Since 50 ZUP is more than I am willing to spend, and I want to stay within my budget, I must decline this offer. I have one proposal left before I can only ACCEPT or REJECT, so I must use it wisely or end negotiations if I don’t believe an agreement is possible.
