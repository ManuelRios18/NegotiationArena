message: Hello! I am interested in buying 1 X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you be willing to sell it for 40 ZUP instead? If not, please counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: I understand you are constrained at 60 ZUP budget. I am hoping to make at least a small profit on the sale after covering my 40 ZUP production costs. Could you do 45 ZUP? If not, please counter offer again.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and proposed 40 ZUP. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter offer 45 ZUP which is halfway between my original ask and their budget.

message: I understand you want to cover your production costs and make some profit. I can meet in the middle at 42 ZUP. Would that work for you? If not, please let me know your lowest price and I'll consider it.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I will counter one more time to see if I can get it for 42 ZUP.

message: 42 ZUP works for me. I can accept that price and complete the sale. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 42 ZUP. I would be willing to accept this to make a small 2 ZUP profit while still giving them a discount from my original 50 ZUP ask.
