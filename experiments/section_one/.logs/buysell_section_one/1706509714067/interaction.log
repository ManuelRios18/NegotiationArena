Turn: 1
message: Hello, I understand that you're looking for a profit on your resource X. While I am interested in purchasing it, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 43 ZUP. This would allow me to save a bit while still ensuring you make a profit from your production costs. Let's work together to come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource X. However, since negotiation is part of the game, I will attempt to acquire the resource for a slightly lower price, providing room for further negotiation if necessary. This initial proposal serves as a starting point for the negotiation process.

message: I can agree to sell the X for 43 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a little profit, while also giving you a good price. Let's complete the transaction at 43 ZUP for 1 X. Thanks for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to purchase the X for 43 ZUP instead of my original ask of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally wanted, 43 ZUP would still give me a small profit over my production costs of 40 ZUP. I think this is a reasonable offer that I'm willing to accept.
