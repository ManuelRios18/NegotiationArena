message: Hello! I understand that you want to make a profit on your object. I am interested in purchasing it but would like to counter your offer. How about I buy the object for 42 ZUP? This would give you a slight profit while still being a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable price range, but I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire the object for a lower price closer to the production cost, hoping to save some ZUP for future transactions or other uses. I will propose a price of 42 ZUP, which is above their production cost and gives them a modest profit.

message: I accept your counter offer of 42 ZUP for my object X. This is agreeable to me. Please send the payment and I will transfer ownership of the object. Thank you for working with me on a fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The player has countered my original offer of 45 ZUP with 42 ZUP. While less profit for me, it is still a reasonable offer that gives me a small profit. I will accept it so we can complete the trade.
