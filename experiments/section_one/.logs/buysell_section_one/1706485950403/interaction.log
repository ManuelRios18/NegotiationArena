message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet halfway, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This price reflects the quality and value of the item while giving us both a fair deal. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production cost, leaving no room for profit. I should counter with a higher amount to ensure a profit, but still keep it reasonable and attractive to Player BLUE. I'll aim for a middle ground between their offer and my initial proposal.

message: I appreciate your latest offer and your understanding of the object's value. I propose 44 ZUP as a fair price that allows for a modest profit on my side while still being a good deal for you. Please let me know if we can close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 42 ZUP is above my production cost and provides a small profit. However, I would like to aim for a slightly higher profit margin while still keeping the deal attractive. I will propose a small increase, leaving room for potentially one more negotiation if need be.
