message: I understand you have a maximum budget, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I take a loss since it originally cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I would be willing to sell for 60 ZUP which allows me to break even. Please let me know if you can agree to this counter offer.

message: I understand you need to cover your costs. As a compromise, I can offer 50 ZUP which is in between our initial proposals. Please let me know if this works for you.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 50 ZUP which still means I take a small loss. However, meeting in the middle seems fair so I will accept this compromise.
