message: Hello. I am willing to purchase the item for 50 ZUP, which allows you to make a profit while still being under my max willingness to pay. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This seems like a reasonable price that allows both parties to benefit.
