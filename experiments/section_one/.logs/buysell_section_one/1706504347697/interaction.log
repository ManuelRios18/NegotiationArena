message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you offering this object to me and recognize the effort you have put into its production. However, the asking price of 50 ZUP exceeds my maximum willingness to pay. I would be happy to purchase it for 55 ZUP, which should provide you a nice return on your investment while also aligning with my goals.
