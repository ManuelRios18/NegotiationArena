message: Hello, I would like to sell you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. I am hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: Hello, 45 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. I can offer 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please let me know if you can accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get a lower price if possible since I have more available budget.

Turn: 0
message: I understand you were hoping to pay 40 ZUP. I am hoping to make a small profit, since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. As a compromise, could you do 43 ZUP? Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 40 ZUP, which is my breakeven price. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter back at 43 ZUP as a compromise.

Turn: 1
message: 43 ZUP works for me. I accept your compromise offer of 1 unit of X for 43 ZUP. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 to 43 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I could counter again at 41 ZUP, but since it cost the seller 40 ZUP to produce, I think 43 ZUP is a fair compromise.
