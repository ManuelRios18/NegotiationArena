message: Thank you for your offer! I understand that you are looking for a profit, and I am willing to pay for the value of the object X. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This would still provide you with a profit above your production costs. Please let me know if this counteroffer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. Accepting the given price would allow for a quick transaction without the need for further negotiation. However, it is often expected in negotiations to counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there is room for a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost for Player RED but still offers them a profit margin.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than my original ask, this still gives me a 5 ZUP profit. I will accept this as it achieves my goal of covering costs plus making some profit.
