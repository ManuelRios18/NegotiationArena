message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, the lowest I can go is 35 ZUP. Would that work for you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE seems to be firm on 20 ZUP. Since my cost of production was 40 ZUP, selling for 20 ZUP would result in a loss. I will propose a final counter offer of 35 ZUP.
