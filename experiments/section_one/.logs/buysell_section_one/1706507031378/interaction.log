message: Hello! I am definitely interested in buying 1 unit of X. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I respect that. I would like to propose a price of 42 ZUP, which still gives you a profit over your cost. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP for the resource X. However, as part of the negotiation strategy, I will counter with a lower offer to see if I can acquire the resource for less than the asking price, while still offering a price that allows for Player RED to profit.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your counteroffer. To further meet in the middle, I propose a price of 43 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that allows for your profit and saves me some resources for future investments.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is slightly above my proposed price but still below my maximum willingness to pay. I will attempt to negotiate for an even lower price while ensuring that Player RED still makes a profit, aiming to reach an agreement that is closer to my initial counteroffer.
