message: Hello, thanks for your offer. 50 ZUP is within my budget, but I would prefer to pay less if possible. Could you consider selling X for 40 ZUP instead? Let me know if you can agree to that price or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price if possible since I have a total budget of 100 ZUP.

message: Hi there. I understand you would prefer to pay less. I can come down a little bit to 45 ZUP, which allows me to make a small profit while giving you a discount from my original ask. Does that work for you? Let me know if you can do 45 ZUP or would like to counter offer again.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP, which is my break even price since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter offer 45 ZUP which is in between my original ask and their offer.

message: Thanks for lowering your asking price. I can do 42 ZUP for X. Does that work for you? If not, please let me know if you can agree to any price lower than 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. However, I will try to negotiate the price down a bit further to 42 ZUP.

message: 42 ZUP works for me. I can accept that price. Please confirm you agree to purchase X for 42 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 42 ZUP. I originally wanted 50 ZUP. I could counter again at 44 ZUP but I think 42 ZUP is reasonable for me to make a small profit while giving the buyer a good price.
