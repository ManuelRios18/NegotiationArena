message: Hello! I am willing to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I would like to try to make some profit from this transaction. Please let me know if 50 ZUP seems reasonable to you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am starting with an initial offer to sell the resource for slightly above what it cost me to produce.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! I understand you're looking for a profit, and while I appreciate the offer, I'd be more comfortable with a slightly lower price. Would you consider 45 ZUP for your unit of resource X? It still gives you a profit above your costs, and it's within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since the seller's cost is 40 ZUP and they are looking for a profit, a counteroffer closer to my maximum willingness to pay but lower than their asking price could potentially be agreeable to both parties. I am proposing 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable increase over their cost and leaves room for further negotiation.

message: I can accept 45 ZUP for my 1 unit of resource X. This still gives me a bit of profit over my costs. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over my costs. I will accept their offer.
