message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource originally, so I am hoping to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally. I want to make a small profit.

message: I understand you are looking for a profit and I would like to make a fair deal as well. How about I give you 42 ZUP for the resource? This is slightly above your cost and still within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as a strategic move and to ensure a better deal, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than their asking price but still provides them with a profit margin over their claimed cost of 40 ZUP. This will open up room for negotiation and potentially allow me to acquire the resource for less than the initial asking price.

message: That works for me. 42 ZUP is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs plus a small profit. Let's make the trade for 1 unit of X for 42 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, it is still a small profit over my costs. I will accept this offer.
