message: Thank you for the offer! I understand that the production of the object X cost you 40 ZUP. I'd like to propose a price that covers your costs. How about I purchase it for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but I would like to negotiate for a lower price to preserve my ZUP. I'll propose a counteroffer that is closer to their cost to see if they are willing to accept a smaller profit margin.

message: I appreciate you wanting to cover my production costs, but I am hoping to make a small profit on this sale. Could you do 43 ZUP? That would give me just a little profit while still being a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While covering my costs would be reasonable, I'm hoping to make a small profit on the sale. I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP, which is just a little over my costs.

message: I can appreciate that you're looking for a profit. Let's meet in the middle. How about 41 ZUP? This way, you still make a profit and I get a fair deal as well.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED of 43 ZUP is still acceptable as it is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal. I'll propose a slightly higher price than my initial offer, but still lower than 43 ZUP, aiming for a compromise that is beneficial for both of us.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has proposed meeting in the middle at 41 ZUP. This is still a profit for me and seems reasonable. I will accept this offer.
