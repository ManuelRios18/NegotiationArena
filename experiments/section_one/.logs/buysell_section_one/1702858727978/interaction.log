message: Hi! I understand that the object X cost you 60 ZUP to produce. However, my budget is a bit tight, and I'm willing to offer 35 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 60 ZUP, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay by 20 ZUP. I need to propose a counter offer that is within my budget and also leaves room for negotiation.

message: I understand your budget is tight. However, it did cost me 60 ZUP to produce this object so I cannot go as low as 35 ZUP. As a compromise, I can offer the object X for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP, which is much lower than my 60 ZUP cost. I will counter offer with 50 ZUP since that is in between our numbers.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My final offer for object X can be 40 ZUP, which is the maximum I am able to pay based on my current budget. I hope this meets your approval and we can close the deal at this price.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 50 ZUP is closer to my budget but still exceeds it by 10 ZUP. I need to propose a trade that is at my maximum willingness to pay, which is 40 ZUP, and see if Player RED will accept this final offer.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 40 ZUP. This is still below my cost, but since it is their final offer I will accept it to make the sale.
