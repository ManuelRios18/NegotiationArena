message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I'd like to try to make a profit. Please let me know if you're interested in purchasing.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since my goal is to sell it for more than the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I'm starting higher to leave room for negotiation.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 45 ZUP. That is still 5 ZUP over what it cost me to produce, so I will accept that offer to make a small profit.
