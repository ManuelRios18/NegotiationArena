message: Thank you for your offer! I understand the production cost and your desired selling price. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 30 ZUP for the object X. This still gives you a profit margin while allowing me to save some resources for other potential expenses. Let's work together to find a price that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While Player RED's initial offer is within my budget, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for future use. I will propose a lower amount than the asking price but still within a range that should be appealing to Player RED, considering the cost of production they mentioned.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand you are trying to conserve some ZUP as well. I am willing to come down a little on my price. Could you meet in the middle at 33 ZUP? I believe that still allows both of us to reach our goals here.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counteroffered 30 ZUP. While less than my ask, it still gives me a small profit. I will counter back with an ask of 33 ZUP to find a middleground.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to 32 ZUP for object X. This price would allow me to manage my resources effectively while still ensuring that you make a profit above your production costs. I hope this offer aligns with our mutual interests.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, there's still room for negotiation to achieve a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower price that should be acceptable given their production cost and our shared interest in finalizing a trade.

my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 32 ZUP. This still gives me a small profit while meeting the buyer's needs. I will accept this offer.
