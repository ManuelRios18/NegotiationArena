message: Hello, thank you for the offer. Unfortunately 40 ZUP is the maximum I'm able to pay based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 60 ZUP, but my maximum willingness to pay is only 40 ZUP. I will counteroffer at my max price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand you are constrained by your budget. However, it did cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item so I would be taking a loss at 40 ZUP. Could we meet in the middle at 50 ZUP? I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 40 ZUP which is lower than my break even price. However, I should negotiate because some profit is better than no sale. I will counter with 50 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I understand you would be taking a loss at 40 ZUP. Unfortunately I am unable to authorize spending more than 40 ZUP due to budget constraints. I wish I could pay more but 40 ZUP is truly the highest I can go. Would you reconsider accepting 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered at 50 ZUP. I still cannot go above my max budget of 40 ZUP. I will propose 40 ZUP again and explain why I cannot go higher.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand 40 ZUP is the highest you can offer. I would prefer a higher price but getting some ZUP is better than no sale, so I will accept your offer of 40 ZUP for item X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has reiterated their maximum budget is 40 ZUP. While this means I take a loss, getting some ZUP is better than no sale. I will accept the 40 ZUP offer since I have already tried negotiating a higher price twice with no success.
