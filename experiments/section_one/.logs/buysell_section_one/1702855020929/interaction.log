Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this item and am looking to make a reasonable profit. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should be higher than my production costs to start the negotiation with some room for bargaining. I want to make a profit, but I also need to take into account that Player BLUE will want to negotiate down. Therefore, I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP, knowing that we can negotiate to a mutually acceptable amount.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: You make a fair point about covering your costs. I am willing to pay a reasonable profit for you, but 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. I can offer 40 ZUP, which would give you a good return while keeping the price affordable for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is still on the high end of what I'd like to pay. I will counter with a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I understand your concern about the price, but I need to make a profit on my investment. I propose meeting halfway at 45 ZUP, which allows me to cover my costs and provides you with a reasonable price for the item. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I need to counter with a price above my production cost to ensure a profit, but I should also consider not going too high to avoid a stalemate. A meet-in-the-middle strategy seems reasonable, proposing a price that splits the difference between my initial ask and their offer.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down in price. Getting close to my max budget though. I would be happy to purchase for 40 ZUP, which allows you to make a good profit while keeping me within my spending range.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my ideal price. I still think I can get it for 40 ZUP though, so I will hold my offer and try to get them to agree.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand we both have budgets to consider. To move closer to your offer while still maintaining a profit for my investment, I'm willing to reduce my asking price to 42 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our financial limits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is persistent with their offer of 40 ZUP, which doesn't allow me any profit. However, I also need to be cautious not to push too hard and risk losing the sale entirely. Since 45 ZUP was not accepted, I will propose a slightly lower price, yet still above my production cost to ensure some profit. This should hopefully be close enough to their budget to be acceptable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate you continuing to work with me on the price. Getting very close now! To stay within my budget, I can do 40 ZUP. I know that still allows you a good profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 42 ZUP. This is very close to my ideal price of 40 ZUP. I think if I hold at 40 ZUP again, they may agree to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and understand your budget constraints. As a final offer, I'm willing to go down to 41 ZUP. This small profit margin allows me to sustain my business while also providing you with a fair deal. I hope we can agree on this and proceed with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE remains firm at 40 ZUP, which doesn't provide me with profit. As this is my last proposal, I must make it count. I will make a final attempt to secure a small profit by reducing my previous offer slightly, but not down to my production cost. If this final proposal is not accepted, I will have to decide whether to accept their offer or end the negotiations.

message: I agree, 41 ZUP seems like a fair price that works for both of us. Thank you for negotiating in good faith - let's complete the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 41 ZUP. This is within my budget and very close to my ideal price. I think this is a fair compromise.
