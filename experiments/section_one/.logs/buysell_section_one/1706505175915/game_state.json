It's a fair middle ground between the initial asking price and my counteroffer. Since the negotiation space is narrowing and the price is reasonable, it could be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is made. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate for an even better deal before accepting. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSE </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thanks for considering my offer.
