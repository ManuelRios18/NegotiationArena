message: Hello, I am looking to sell the object for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm interested in buying the object. However, I'd like to propose a new deal of 45 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources and Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, the deal is within my acceptable range. However, it's generally good practice to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since it's the initial offer. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer. I propose 47 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my target price. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher amount to see if we can reach a deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my offer. I appreciate your counteroffer, and to move things along, I propose 46 ZUP for the object. I think this is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal we can be happy with.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is still within my budget of 60 ZUP, and it's close to my initial counteroffer. It's a fair middle ground between the initial asking price and my counteroffer. Since the negotiation space is narrowing and the price is reasonable, it could be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the deal is made. However, I will make one more attempt to negotiate for an even better deal before accepting.

message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the proposal of 46 ZUP for the object. Looking forward to completing the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has made another counteroffer, reducing the price to 46 ZUP. This is very close to my target price, so I will accept this offer to close the deal.
