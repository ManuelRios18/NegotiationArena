message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your valuation. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my single resource, X, for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that gives me a profit, but also leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging that Player BLUE will want to negotiate for a better price. I will propose a price slightly higher than my cost to see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: I am willing to pay 55 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is close to my maximum, so I likely cannot go much higher.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am happy to accept the trade of 1 unit of resource X for 55 ZUP. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is above my production cost, which meets my goal of selling for more than it cost me to produce the resource. However, the offer exceeds my initial asking price, indicating that Player BLUE might value the resource more than I anticipated. This is a favorable situation for me, and I should accept the offer, securing a profit without further negotiation which could risk the deal altogether.
