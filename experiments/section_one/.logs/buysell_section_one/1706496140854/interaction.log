message: I am interested in buying the resource X. Considering the market and the value it would bring to my objectives, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 42 ZUP. This is a competitive price that allows for both of us to benefit from the trade. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, there is usually some room for bargaining. I will counter-offer with a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate. This will allow me to preserve some of my resources for future transactions or investments.
