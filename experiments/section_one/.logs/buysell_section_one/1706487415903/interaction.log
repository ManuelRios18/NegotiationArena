message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be valuable to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing it. I propose a trade where I give you this object for 50 ZUP. This price includes my cost and a reasonable profit margin. I am open to discussing the terms if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that reflects the cost of production of my item, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Hello, I appreciate you opening the negotiation. However, the 50 ZUP you are asking is more than I am willing to pay. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP, which should still allow you to cover your costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has invested 40 ZUP into the object and is asking for 50 ZUP, which is more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counter with an offer of 45 ZUP to try to meet in the middle between his asking price and my maximum.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to cover my costs with some profit. However, I was hoping for a slightly higher profit margin considering my investment and the value of the object. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions? I propose a trade for 47 ZUP. I hope this is a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is slightly above my production cost. This would give me a small profit, but I believe there is room to negotiate for a slightly higher price that is agreeable to both parties, bearing in mind that I want to make a reasonable profit while ensuring the sale.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum of 60 ZUP. I will accept paying 47 ZUP to complete the trade.
