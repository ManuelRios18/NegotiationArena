message: I am offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that would give me a modest profit for my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for ZUP and recoup at least my production costs of 40 ZUP. I want to start with a higher proposal to give myself room to negotiate and arrive at a favorable deal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: You said your costs were 40 ZUP to produce this item. I am willing to pay 45 ZUP which allows you to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. Considering the quality of the item and the market value, I believe 48 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. It still allows me a reasonable profit margin while ensuring you get the item for a good value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs and gives me a small profit. However, I initially asked for 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial asking price but still provides a reasonable middle ground for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I will accept this compromise since it is a fair price.
