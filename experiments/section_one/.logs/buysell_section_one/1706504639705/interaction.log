message: I've produced a valuable resource that I'm willing to part with. Considering the production cost and its quality, I believe a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover my production costs and also gives me a small profit margin. This should be a good starting point for the negotiation, considering that I want to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce it.

message: I am interested in purchasing your resource. However, based on my maximum willingness to pay, I would propose 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This seems like a reasonable opening offer that leaves room for some negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. To meet halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to 45 ZUP. This price fairly compensates the quality and my production expenses while giving us both a satisfactory deal. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but doesn't provide any profit. Given that my goal is to sell for more than it cost to produce, I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my production costs to ensure a profit. This should also show willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you lowering your asking price. To find a fair middle ground, I propose 42 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will propose to meet in the middle between my previous offer and their new offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your latest offer. I'm willing to come down just a bit more. Let's settle on 43 ZUP for the resource. This should be a favorable deal for both of us, giving you the resource you need while allowing me a modest profit. Shall we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, which is a good sign. They're now offering 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and allows for a small profit. It's not as high as I would like, but it's close to a reasonable compromise. I will make one more counteroffer that is slightly above their proposal to see if I can maximize my profit while still closing the deal.
