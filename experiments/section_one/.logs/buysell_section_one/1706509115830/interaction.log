message: Hi there! I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking of something closer to 45 ZUP for the item. This would still give you a profit over the production costs. What do you think about this deal?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I understand that Player RED wants to make a profit, but since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP for the item, I will start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.
