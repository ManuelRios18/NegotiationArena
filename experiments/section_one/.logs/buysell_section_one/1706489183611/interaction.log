message: Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose 35 ZUP instead. What do you think about that?

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a strategic buyer, I should attempt to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than what they have asked but still within a range that I consider fair and within my goals.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I'd like to counter with 37 ZUP. It's a bit closer to your asking price. Could that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their desire for 40 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range. To keep the negotiation going and to potentially reach a middle ground, I will increase my offer slightly without meeting their full asking price yet. This shows willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal.

message: Alright, I'll meet your price of 40 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is standing firm on their asking price of 40 ZUP. Since this is within my maximum willingness to pay and there seems to be little room for further negotiation, it may be strategic to accept their offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource without risking the deal by pushing for a lower price any further.
