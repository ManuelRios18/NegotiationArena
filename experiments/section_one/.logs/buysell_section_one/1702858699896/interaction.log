message: Hello! I am selling 1 X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce this X. I am hoping to sell it to you for 70 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Please let me know if you are willing to purchase it for 70 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but 70 ZUP is a bit steep for me. How about 45 ZUP for the X? It's more in line with my budget, and it still offers you a chance to profit from your costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 70 ZUP, which exceeds my maximum willingness to pay by 30 ZUP. In order to move towards a more acceptable price, I will propose a counteroffer closer to my target price but still giving Player RED an opportunity to make a profit.

message: I can accept 45 ZUP for the X. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 45 ZUP which is lower than my asking price. But it still allows me to make a small profit over my costs. I will accept it since I want to make the sale.
