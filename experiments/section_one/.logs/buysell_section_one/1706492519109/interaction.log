message: Hello. I am interested in purchasing the object, but would you consider selling it for 30 ZUP instead? That is the highest I am willing to pay at this time.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 40 ZUP for the object, which is under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since it is still early in the negotiation.

message: That works for me. I accept purchasing the object for 35 ZUP. Please confirm if you agree to sell it for this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 35 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this price since it is only 5 ZUP more than my previous offer and seems reasonable.
