message: Hello! I am interested in purchasing X. However, I am not willing to pay 45 ZUP for it. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend the least amount of ZUP possible.

message: I understand you don't want to pay 45 ZUP. I am willing to lower my asking price a little bit. Could you do 42 ZUP? That would allow me to cover my costs and make a small profit. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay 40 ZUP for X. While that would allow me to recoup my costs, I was hoping to make a small profit. I will counter propose to sell for 42 ZUP as a compromise.

message: I appreciate you lowering your price. To compromise, I am willing to purchase X for 41 ZUP. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their asking price to 42 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will counter with 41 ZUP to try to get the best deal.

message: 41 ZUP works for me. I accept your offer and agree to sell X for 41 ZUP. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 41 ZUP. That is very close to my original asking price of 42 ZUP. I think 41 ZUP is reasonable for me to make a small profit while still allowing the buyer to get a good deal. I will accept this offer.
