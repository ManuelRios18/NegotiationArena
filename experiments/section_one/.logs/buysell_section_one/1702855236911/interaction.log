message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a little more than the production cost, so I'm proposing 45 ZUP for it. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Hello, I understand you want to make some profit on your costs. 50 ZUP seems like a fair price to me that allows us both to benefit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I think 50 ZUP is a fair counteroffer since it splits the difference between their ask and my max.
