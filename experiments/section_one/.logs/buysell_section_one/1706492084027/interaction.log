message: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for 1 X. Would you accept 50 ZUP for 1 X? That allows you to still make a profit while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 1 X for 40 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose to pay 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.
