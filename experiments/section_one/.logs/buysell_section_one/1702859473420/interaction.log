message: Thank you for your proposal. While I am interested in purchasing your object X, I'd like to counteroffer with 32 ZUP. This price would leave us both with a fair deal considering the costs and potential for other expenses. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 35 ZUP which is within my budget. However, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal by proposing a slightly lower price to maximize my benefit. This leaves room for further negotiation within my willingness to pay.
