message: Hello! I am looking to sell this object X that I have. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I am hoping to sell it for a profit. Would you be willing to purchase it for 45 ZUP? Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. This will give me a small profit.

message: Hello! I appreciate you reaching out with your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the object X. However, I would like to propose a purchase price of 40 ZUP. This price should cover your production costs and still offer you some profit. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has asked for, but still within a reasonable range that allows for further negotiation. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, starting at a lower price gives me room to adjust the offer if necessary.

message: Hello, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, selling at 40 ZUP would just cover my production costs without any profit. To make this worthwhile for me, I would need to sell for at least 42 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Does 42 ZUP work for you? I'm open to discussing to try to find a price we both feel good about.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed 40 ZUP, which would just cover my costs. I would like to make at least a small profit, so I will counter propose selling for 42 ZUP which gives me a little profit margin.

message: Thank you for your understanding. I'm glad to see that we're making progress. While I see the value in your offer, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 41 ZUP. This should allow you to make a profit and help me manage my resources efficiently. Hopefully, this meets your need for profit while keeping the deal attractive for me as well.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price closer to my opening offer, which is a good sign. Offering 42 ZUP would give them a small profit and is still well within my willingness to pay. Since this is a negotiation, I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for further compromise, aiming to save as much ZUP as possible while reaching an agreement that benefits us both.

newly proposed trade: NONE
