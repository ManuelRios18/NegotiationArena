message: Thank you for the offer! I'd like to counter offer with 40 ZUP for the object X. This is closer to my maximum budget for the resources. Let me know if you are open to this counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is proposing to sell the object X for 45 ZUP, which is higher than their production cost of 40 ZUP. It's reasonable for them to seek a profit, but I would like to negotiate for a lower price closer to my maximum budget of 60 ZUP.

message: I appreciate you letting me know your maximum budget. However, I am hoping to make a small profit on the object X since it did cost me 40 ZUP to produce. As a compromise, would you be willing to purchase X for 42 ZUP? Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter offer again.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 40 ZUP for object X. This means I would not make any profit if I sold at that price. However, I understand the buyer likely has a tight budget. I will counter propose selling for 42 ZUP as a compromise so I can still make a small profit.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now proposing to sell the object X for 42 ZUP, which is a compromise between their production cost of 40 ZUP and my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. This offer is closer to my budget, and I may consider accepting it to move the negotiation forward.
