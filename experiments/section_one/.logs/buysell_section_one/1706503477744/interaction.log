message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose a trade for 50 ZUP to see how much Player BLUE values the object X.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting this negotiation and putting an opening offer on the table. However, 50 ZUP seems a bit high compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I would be happy to purchase the object X for 40 ZUP, which allows us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since 50 ZUP seems on the higher end.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a fair deal. I believe that 45 ZUP would be a reasonable compromise for both of us. It's slightly above my production cost, ensuring I cover my expenses, while staying well within your budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated their maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and has offered 40 ZUP. To move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement, I will propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and below Player BLUE's maximum willingness to pay. This should be an attractive offer for Player BLUE while ensuring I make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED. I agree, 45 ZUP seems like a fair compromise. It allows you to cover your expenses while fitting my budget. I accept trading 45 ZUP for your object X. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down in price to 45 ZUP. This is within my maximum willingness to pay. I could try to negotiate further, but 45 ZUP seems like a reasonable deal and I risk the seller refusing to go lower if I counter again.
