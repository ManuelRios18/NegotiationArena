my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.

message: Thank you for the offer! I'm interested in buying your resource, but I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 40 ZUP. Would that be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it's often beneficial to negotiate to see if a better price can be achieved. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a range that might be acceptable to the seller.

message: I can accept your offer of 40 ZUP. This covers my costs so I am willing to complete the sale. Please confirm if you would still like to purchase at 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer has countered with 40 ZUP. This covers my costs but does not provide any profit. However, since I only have one resource to sell, I will accept this to guarantee I can sell it.
