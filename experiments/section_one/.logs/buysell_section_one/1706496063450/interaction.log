message: Hello! I'm interested in the object X. However, I'd like to propose a starting offer of 45 ZUP. We can work from there to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is selling the object for 50 ZUP, which is within my willing range of payment. However, as a buyer, I should aim to negotiate a better price if possible, starting lower to leave room for negotiation.

message: I agree to sell the object X for 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a bit of profit. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 45 ZUP. While less than my asking price, it is still 5 ZUP profit for me. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
