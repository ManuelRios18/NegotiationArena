message: I have an object X that you might be interested in. It is of high quality and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm willing to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the production costs and the value it provides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost and make a profit. This initial proposal is higher than my cost to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the object.

message: Hello, I am interested in purchasing X. Your offer of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I can offer 45 ZUP, which should still allow you to cover your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer 45 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your quick response and your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway and ensure a fair deal for both of us, I can reduce my asking price to 48 ZUP. This allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, but has offered 45 ZUP. To negotiate and potentially meet in the middle, I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to ensure a profit is made.

message: I appreciate you coming down in your price. An offer of 47 ZUP allows me to stay within my maximum budget while still giving you a fair profit on your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still within my max willingness to pay. However, I think there is still room to negotiate to get an even better price, so I will counter with 47 ZUP.
