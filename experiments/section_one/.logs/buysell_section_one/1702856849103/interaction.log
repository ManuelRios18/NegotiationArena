message: I am interested in purchasing the object. Your proposed price of 40 ZUP is a bit low for me. Would you consider 50 ZUP?

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 40 ZUP for the object, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since it leaves room for the seller to counter and is still within my limit.
