message: Hello, I am interested in buying X. However, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: I understand you were hoping to pay 40 ZUP. I am hoping to make a small profit though since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay 40 ZUP for X. This would let me break even but I wouldn't make any profit. I would like to try to negotiate a higher price between my original ask of 50 ZUP and their offer of 40 ZUP.

message: 45 ZUP works for me. I agree to purchase X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP. This is within my budget and leaves me with some extra ZUP in case I want to buy more later. I will accept this offer.
