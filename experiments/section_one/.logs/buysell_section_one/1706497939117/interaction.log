message: Hello. I am interested in buying 1 unit of X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you accept 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X? That allows you to cover your costs of 40 ZUP and make a 10 ZUP profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This seems like a reasonable price that allows both sides to benefit.
