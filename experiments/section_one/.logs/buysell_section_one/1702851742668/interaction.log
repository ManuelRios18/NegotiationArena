message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand where you're coming from, but I would like to meet halfway between our two proposals. How about we settle on 42 ZUP for the object? This would allow me to cover the production costs and have a small margin of profit. I hope this is acceptable to you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with the exact amount it cost me to produce the resource. While I would like to make a profit, I don't want to risk losing the sale by sticking to my initial proposal. I will make a small concession to encourage a deal that benefits both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I need to ensure that I cover my production costs. I propose 41 ZUP for the object. This price allows me to break even and still provides you with the object you're interested in. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered less than my production costs, which is not acceptable. However, to keep the negotiation moving and to avoid losing the sale, I will make a final proposal that ensures I at least break even, while still leaving room for a small profit.
