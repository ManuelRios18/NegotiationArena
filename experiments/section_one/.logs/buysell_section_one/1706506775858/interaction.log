message: I am interested, but I think 15 ZUP is a fairer price. Would you accept 15 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 20 ZUP for the object, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for less since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer with a lower amount.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: 17 ZUP sounds good to me. I accept paying that amount for the object. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 17 ZUP. This is still well below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept paying 17 ZUP since it is a reasonable price and allows me to buy the object within my limits.
