message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X that I have. I am hoping we can make a fair deal that works for both of us. Please let me know if you are interested in purchasing X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit on the sale.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thank you for your proposal. I am interested in purchasing item X, but I would like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at the lower end of my willingness to pay for the resource X. I want to negotiate for a better deal while also establishing a cooperative relationship. Therefore, I propose a slightly lower amount of ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but gives room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for the counter offer. I am hoping to make some profit on this sale since it did cost me 40 ZUP to produce item X. As a compromise, I would propose selling X to you for 48 ZUP. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed 45 ZUP for item X. That is a bit lower than I was hoping for but still 5 ZUP above what it cost me to produce. I would like to try to get 50 ZUP if possible so I will counter propose 48 ZUP as a compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand you want to make a profit on your sale. I would like to meet you halfway from my last offer and propose 46 ZUP for item X. I hope this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly in their asking price, but it is still below the maximum I am willing to pay. However, I'd like to get closer to the middle ground between our two offers. Proposing a price that is midway between my initial counteroffer and their current proposal could be seen as a reasonable compromise and might be acceptable to both parties.

message: I agree, meeting in the middle seems fair. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for item X. I appreciate you negotiating with me to find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player came up from their initial offer and is now proposing 46 ZUP. That gets me very close to my original asking price. I think I will accept this offer since it still gives me 6 ZUP profit.
