message: I understand you were hoping not to spend more than 40 ZUP. I am hoping to make some profit though. As a compromise, I can lower my asking price to 45 ZUP - halfway between my original proposal and your counter. Does this work for you?

message: I appreciate you coming down in your asking price. To find a fair middle ground, I propose 42 ZUP, which is halfway between your ask of 45 and my offer of 40. Does 42 ZUP work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I could propose 42 ZUP as a midpoint between 40 and 45 to see if we can agree.
