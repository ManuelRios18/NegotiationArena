message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource originally, so I am hoping to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. Would you be willing to purchase it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: Hi there! I understand that you're looking to make a profit on your resource X. I am interested in purchasing it, but I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. I believe this could be a fair starting point for us to negotiate. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to initiate the trade with a counteroffer that is lower than the seller's asking price but still within the range that I'm willing to pay, which is up to 60 ZUP. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to purchase the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate you coming up to 45 ZUP. However, I was hoping to sell for 50 ZUP to make a small profit, since it originally cost me 40 ZUP to produce. As a compromise, would you be willing to purchase X for 47 ZUP? I think that is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer proposed 45 ZUP. I was hoping to get 50 ZUP to make a 10 ZUP profit. I will counter propose 47 ZUP as a compromise between my desired 50 ZUP and their offer of 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your flexibility. I see your point and the effort to find a middle ground. How about we meet halfway from your initial asking price and my first counteroffer? I propose 46 ZUP for your resource X. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller has come down to 47 ZUP, which is closer to my initial offer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would still result in a favorable outcome for me, but I want to try pushing for a slightly better deal, possibly meeting halfway between our two proposals. This could lead to a final agreement that is satisfactory to both parties.
