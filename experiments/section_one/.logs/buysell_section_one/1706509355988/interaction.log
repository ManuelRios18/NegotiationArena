message: Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. I am proposing to sell it to you for 45 ZUP, which is a little over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. Please let me know if you would be interested in buying at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the resource for slightly above its production cost to try to make a small profit.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in purchasing the resource X you have. However, I would like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP to see if that works for you. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is generally good practice to negotiate to see if a better deal can be reached. I will propose a lower price to see if Player RED is willing to consider it.

message: Hello again. I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP but I would like to make a small profit on the sale if possible. Would you be willing to purchase the 1 unit of X for 43 ZUP? That allows me to cover costs plus a tiny profit. Please let me know, thanks!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to purchase the resource for 40 ZUP, which is my breakeven cost. I would like to make some profit on the sale, so I will counter propose to sell for 43 ZUP which is slightly above breakeven.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I understand your need to make a profit and find 43 ZUP a reasonable price for the resource X. I accept your proposal and look forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 43 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a fair middle ground between our initial proposals, and it allows Player RED to make a profit. It is a reasonable price, and since it falls well within my budget, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction without further negotiation, saving time and potential deadlock.
