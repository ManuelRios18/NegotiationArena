message: I understand your need to cover production costs. How about we settle at 35 ZUP? It's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player RED is above my initial proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. It might be beneficial to meet in the middle, which would be fair for both sides and ensure that Player RED covers their costs while I still get a good deal.
