message: Hello! I have 1 object X to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: I appreciate your offer. However, considering the market and my budget, I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair offer that still provides you with a profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the object X for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, it's beneficial to propose a counteroffer that's lower than the initial asking price to negotiate a better deal, while still keeping the offer reasonable and attractive for Player RED.

message: I can accept your counter offer of 45 ZUP for object X. This still gives me a small profit over what it cost me to produce. Please let me know if you would still like to purchase object X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 45 ZUP for object X. While less than my original ask of 50 ZUP, this still gives me a small profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I will accept this counter offer since it meets my goal of making some profit.
