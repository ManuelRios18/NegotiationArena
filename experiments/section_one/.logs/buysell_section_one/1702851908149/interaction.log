message: I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm offering it at a fair price of 45 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a small profit. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Since the production cost of my resource X is 40 ZUP, I would like to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me to make a profit. However, I need to be careful not to set the price too high, as it might discourage Player BLUE from buying. I will propose a starting price that is slightly above my production cost to open up the negotiation.
