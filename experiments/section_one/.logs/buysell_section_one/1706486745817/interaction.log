message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in purchasing your resource X. However, I believe 50 ZUP is more than I am willing to pay. I can offer 40 ZUP, which would still allow you to cover your costs and make a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the resource, which is within my budget. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs. However, I am looking to make a small profit as well. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This would ensure that I am compensated for my efforts in producing the resource while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE offered to cover the production costs with a 40 ZUP bid. While this covers the cost, it doesn't provide any profit. I want to counter with a price that gives me a profit while still being a reasonable step down from my initial proposal.
