message: I'm interested in the object, but I was hoping to spend a little less. How about 35 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal range since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resources. However, as a strategy, I want to propose a lower amount to see if I can secure the object for less and preserve more of my resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, but I need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. I can meet you halfway at 38 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is interested in the object but is proposing a lower price. I need to consider whether I am willing to accept a lower price than my cost.

message: Thanks for meeting me halfway. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is still within my acceptable range. Accepting the counter-offer of 38 ZUP could close the deal quickly and ensure I get the object while still saving some resources. It's a reasonable price, and it might not be worth the risk to haggle for a lower amount when the seller has already mentioned production costs.
