Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource at a fair price that covers production costs and offers me a small profit margin. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover at least the production cost of the resource. By setting the price a bit higher, I can also leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: My counteroffer is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this price is fair and covers your production costs while staying within my budget. Let's negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my budget. I can propose a counteroffer to negotiate a better price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer. To meet in the middle, I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This should cover my production costs and provide me with a fair profit margin, while still being within a reasonable range for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, but I'd like to ensure I make a profit. I'll propose a slightly higher amount, splitting the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer. This should be agreeable to both parties if Player BLUE is looking to reach a deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X is a reasonable compromise, and it's within my budget. I can accept this offer as it aligns with the price range I'm willing to pay.
