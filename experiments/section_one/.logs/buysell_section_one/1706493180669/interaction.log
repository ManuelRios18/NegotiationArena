message: Hello! I am selling 1 X resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource so I would like to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you would like to purchase it for 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the resource for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. I want to make a small profit.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, and I'm willing to buy the resource. However, I was hoping we could agree on a slightly lower price. Would you consider selling it for 42 ZUP? This would still give you a profit over your cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The starting price proposed by Player RED is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, but it is in my interest to negotiate a lower price if possible to conserve resources. I will counter with a price that is more favorable to me but still above the cost of production for Player RED to ensure they still make a profit, thereby making the counteroffer attractive.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the 1 X resource. This is agreeable to me. Please transfer 42 ZUP and I will transfer the resource. Thank you for working with me on a fair price!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over my costs. I will accept their offer.
