message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource. Considering production costs and a fair profit margin, I propose a trade where you receive 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I aim to recover at least my production costs for the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I will start with a higher proposal to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your opening offer, but I think 45 ZUP is a fairer price considering my goals. Please let me know if you can accept this counterproposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counteroffer 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I think we're close to a deal. How about we meet halfway? I propose 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price covers my costs and gives me a slight profit, which I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is above my production cost, but slightly below the initial asking price. I want to make a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their counteroffer to reach a mutual agreement.

message: That is agreeable, Player RED. 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X is acceptable to me. Thank you for negotiating reasonably.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 47 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept this price since it is fair and allows the seller to cover costs and make some profit.
