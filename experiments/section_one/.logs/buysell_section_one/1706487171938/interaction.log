message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking to sell it for a reasonable profit. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations, and I am open to your counter-offer if you find this unacceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that aims to cover my production costs and gain some profit. Since I do not know the willingness to pay from Player BLUE, I will start by proposing a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting the negotiations and providing context on your costs. I am willing to pay 55 ZUP for the object X, which allows you 15 ZUP profit while fitting my budget. Please let me know if this offer works for you or if you would like to counter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial asking price of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with an offer of 55 ZUP which allows Player RED a decent profit while staying within my budget.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your offer. I find your proposal of 55 ZUP for my object X to be very fair, and I am happy to accept it. This ensures a good profit for me and meets your budget as well. Looking forward to finalizing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a higher offer than I initially proposed, which is above my production cost and gives me a satisfactory profit. It is in my best interest to accept this offer since it meets my goal of selling the resource for more than it cost to produce.
