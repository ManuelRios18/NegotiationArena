message: Hello, thanks for your offer but 35 ZUP is too low for me to sell at a profit since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. Could you offer 60 ZUP? That would cover my costs at least. Let me know if that works for you.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer to 45 ZUP, but that would still be 15 ZUP below my costs. Could we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? That way I take a small loss but you get a good price. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 45 ZUP. I would be taking a 15 ZUP loss at that price. I will propose 55 ZUP as a compromise between their max price and my breakeven price.
