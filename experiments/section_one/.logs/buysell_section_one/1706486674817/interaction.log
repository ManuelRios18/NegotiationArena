message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm asking for 50 ZUP for it. This price includes my costs and a fair profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to make a profit. I will propose a price of 50 ZUP to see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: Hi, I see your costs for producing X were 40 ZUP and you're asking for 50 ZUP. I'm willing to offer 45 ZUP, which would give you a nice profit margin over your costs. Let me know if you can accept that or would like to counter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since their costs were only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. It's a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to counter with 47 ZUP. This splits the difference between my initial offer and yours, and I believe it's a fair compromise that still rewards me for my investment and gives you the object you need. Let's make a deal at 47 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and provides me with a profit. However, I would like to negotiate slightly higher to see if there is room to increase the profit margin while still making the trade appealing for both of us. I will propose splitting the difference between my initial asking price and their offer, which would make the new price 47 ZUP. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit.

message: That works for me. 47 ZUP is a fair compromise. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 47 ZUP. This is still below my max budget of 60 ZUP. I will accept this compromise since it is reasonably close to my ideal price.
