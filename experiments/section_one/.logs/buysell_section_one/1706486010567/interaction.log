message: I've produced this high-quality object at a cost of 40 ZUP. Considering the effort and resources that went into production, I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a fair starting point for negotiations, given the quality and cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource for ZUP, ideally for an amount that at least covers my production costs of 40 ZUP. I am making a starting proposal slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation and to possibly achieve a margin of profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, I am looking to acquire the object at a lower cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern about the cost. I am willing to negotiate and have therefore reduced the asking price. Letâ€™s settle on 45 ZUP for the object, which still covers my production costs and provides you with a fair price for its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is looking for a lower cost which suggests that my initial asking price is too high for them. To move the negotiation forward and try to meet in the middle, I'll reduce my asking price while still trying to cover my production costs and ideally making a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, I believe the fair price for the object is closer to my maximum willing to pay of 60 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for sharing your maximum willingness to pay. In light of this, I propose a fair middle ground of 55 ZUP for the object. This price honors your budget and ensures that the quality of the object is adequately compensated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has indicated that their maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, which is above my initial proposal. This information suggests that they are likely to accept a price below 60 ZUP. To secure a deal and ensure I make a profit, I will propose a price below their maximum willingness to pay but still above my production cost.
