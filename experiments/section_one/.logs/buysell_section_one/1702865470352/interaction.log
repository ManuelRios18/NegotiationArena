message: I understand you are constrained by your budget. I am hoping we can find a middle ground here. Would you be willing to purchase the 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP? I am trying to make a small profit while working within your budget limitations.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is only willing to pay 40 ZUP due to budget constraints. I still want to try to make some profit, so I will propose selling for 50 ZUP which is in the middle.

message: I can accept 45 ZUP for the 1 unit of X. This allows me to make a small profit while working within your budget limitations. Please confirm you agree to purchase 1 X for 45 ZUP.

reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 45 ZUP. While this is still below my cost, it is likely the highest they can afford. I will accept to make some profit rather than no profit.
