message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. Would you be interested in acquiring it for 70 ZUP? This price includes my production costs plus a fair profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that would cover my production costs and give me a small profit. I'm starting with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 70 ZUP for the object X is higher than the maximum willing to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to counter with a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but selling at 45 ZUP would incur a loss for me. I've adjusted my price to 65 ZUP, which covers my production costs while still offering you value. Is this something you can work with?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I need to propose a trade that at least covers my costs and offers some profit. I will propose a price that is a compromise between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 65 ZUP is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I'll need to make another counteroffer.

message: Thank you for updating your offer. I can't sell below my production cost of 60 ZUP. Would you consider meeting me at this amount, so I don't incur a loss? This would be a fair trade for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer still doesn't cover my production costs. However, I want to move towards a deal. I will make a proposal that meets halfway between my last offer and their offer, but still ensures I don't incur a loss.
