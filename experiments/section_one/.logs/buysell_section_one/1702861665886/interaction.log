message: Hello! I am willing to sell my 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This seems like a fair price given it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: I will start by proposing to sell X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. This will give me a small profit.

message: Hi! I appreciate you sharing the cost to produce the resource. Since it only cost you 40 ZUP, would you accept 40 ZUP from me?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since it only cost them 40 ZUP to produce.

message: I appreciate you considering my production costs. However, I would like to make a small profit on this sale. Could you agree to purchase X for 45 ZUP? This would give me a little extra for my efforts.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The other player proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is the same as my production cost. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 45 ZUP.

message: That seems fair. I can agree to purchase X for 45 ZUP so you can cover your costs and make a little extra profit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I think 45 ZUP is a fair price that allows them to cover costs and make a small profit.
