message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I am hoping to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you would be interested in purchasing it for 50 ZUP.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: Hello! I understand you're looking for a profit on your item. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the item X. This would still give you a profit above your production costs. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for the item X. Since my goal is to buy the item for at most 60 ZUP, their asking price is within my budget. However, it's always prudent to negotiate to try and get a better deal, especially since it's the initial offer. I'll propose a counteroffer that is lower than their asking price but still within a reasonable range that allows them to profit.

message: I agree to sell the item X for 45 ZUP. This still gives me a good profit over my production costs. Please let me know next steps to complete the transaction. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While this is lower than I originally asked for, it still gives me a 5 ZUP profit over my costs. I think this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
