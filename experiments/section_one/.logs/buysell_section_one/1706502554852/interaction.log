message: I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's a valuable item, so I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit on the object I am selling. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start by proposing a price slightly above my costs, expecting that there might be some negotiation room. I'll propose a price of 50 ZUP to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that much, or to start the negotiation process.

message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate that you're willing to go above my production cost. However, to reflect the value of the object, I propose a counteroffer of 48 ZUP. This price should give us both a satisfactory deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but still below my initial asking price. Since this is a negotiation, I want to counteroffer with a price that is closer to my initial asking price, but still shows willingness to negotiate. I'll propose 48 ZUP, splitting the difference and moving closer to my desired sale price.
