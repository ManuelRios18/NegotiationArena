message: I have an object X that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Considering the cost of production and its value, I'm proposing a fair trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I would like to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs and also make a profit. I will propose a trade that asks for a slightly higher amount than my production costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object.
