player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100

message: I understand you want to pay less, but I need to cover my costs. I paid 40 ZUP originally to produce this item, so I cannot accept less than that. Could you do 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP, which is lower than my asking price. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter offer selling for 40 ZUP, which is my original cost.

message: Okay, 40 ZUP seems fair since that covers your original costs. I accept trading 40 ZUP for your item X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 40 ZUP now, which matches what they originally paid. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, so I think it is a fair price.
