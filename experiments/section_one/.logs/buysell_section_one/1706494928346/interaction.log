Hello, I appreciate you are interested in buying X and have a budget constraint of 60 ZUP. However, I was hoping to make a small profit as it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Could you meet in the middle at 43 ZUP? This allows me to cover costs and make a little extra. Please let me know if 43 ZUP works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is offering 40 ZUP for X. While this would allow me to recoup my costs, I was hoping to make a small profit. I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

message: 43 ZUP works for me. I agree to purchase X for 43 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 ZUP to 43 ZUP. While this is still above my ideal price of 40 ZUP, it is a reasonable compromise between my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP and allowing the seller to cover costs and make some profit.
