newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am interested in the object. I see your initial offer is 35 ZUP. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's find a fair middle ground!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, as it is the first proposal, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the midpoint between the initial offer and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I can meet in the middle at 40 ZUP for 1 X. This is what it cost me to produce originally.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway. I accept the offer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. It seems like a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has met me in the middle at 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource. This price is fair and it falls below my maximum willingness to pay, ultimately saving me 20 ZUP. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for me and would also respect the seller's costs. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
