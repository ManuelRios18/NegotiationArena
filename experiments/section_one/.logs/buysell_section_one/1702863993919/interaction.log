I understand 40 ZUP is the most you can offer, but I cannot sell for less than my 60 ZUP production cost without losing money. Could we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? That allows me a small profit while giving you a discount from my original ask. Please let me know if this works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 40 ZUP, which is lower than my 60 ZUP production cost. I would be losing money at that price. I will counter offer to try to find a middle ground.

I can accept your final offer of 45 ZUP for object X. This allows me to recover some of my production costs. Please confirm you would still like to purchase object X for 45 ZUP.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer increased their offer to 45 ZUP. This is still below my production costs, but it is the most they are willing to pay. I could reject and fail to make this sale, or I could accept and at least make back some of my costs. I will accept their final offer.
