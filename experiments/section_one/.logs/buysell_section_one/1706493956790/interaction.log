message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Would you be willing to purchase X for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: I understand your need for profit, but as the only buyer, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for object X. This still gives you a profit above your production costs, and we can move forward with a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
While Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe there's an opportunity to negotiate a better price considering that the cost of production was 40 ZUP and I am the only buyer. I want to make an initial proposal that is lower than their asking price but still gives them a profit, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I can agree to sell X for 45 ZUP. This still provides some profit to me. Please confirm you agree to purchase X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked, this still gives me 5 ZUP profit. Since they are the only buyer, I will accept this counteroffer.
