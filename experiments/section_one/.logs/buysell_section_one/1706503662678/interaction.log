message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has good value and would like to propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for it. I think it's a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, my initial proposal should be a bit higher than my production cost to ensure that I can negotiate and still make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my cost.

message: Hello, thank you for the offer. 50 ZUP seems fair but is higher than I was hoping for. Since your costs were 40 ZUP, would you consider 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's proposed price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. To meet halfway and ensure a fair deal for both of us, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for the object X? This price reflects the quality and value of the resource I'm providing while also taking your budget into consideration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which allows for a profit, albeit smaller than initially proposed. I want to negotiate a slightly better deal that is agreeable to both parties, aiming for a middle ground between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

message: 48 ZUP sounds good to me. I accept your counteroffer and agree to trade at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 48 ZUP. This is still within my maximum willingness to pay. I could try to negotiate further, but I think 48 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise.
