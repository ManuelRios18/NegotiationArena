Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 37 ZUP sounds fair. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer from Player RED of 37 ZUP is very close to my previous proposal, and it is still well below my maximum threshold of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the object and save my proposals for potential future negotiations.
