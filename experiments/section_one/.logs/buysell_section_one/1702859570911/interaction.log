message: Hello, I appreciate your counter offer but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I take a loss on the object since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I am willing to lower my asking price though. Could you do 55 ZUP? That allows me a small profit while giving you a discount from my original 70 ZUP ask. Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 40 ZUP which is lower than my cost. I would be taking a loss at that price. I will counter offer to sell for 55 ZUP which is lower than my original ask but still allows me to make a small profit.

message: Thanks for increasing your offer. I really need 50 ZUP to cover my costs on this item, so I'm hoping you can meet in the middle at 50 ZUP. This allows me to roughly break even while giving you a good discount from my original ask. Please let me know if you can do 50 ZUP and we can complete the sale!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer increased their offer to 45 ZUP. That is still lower than my cost but gets closer to allowing me to break even. I will counter one more time to 50 ZUP which splits the difference between their latest offer and my lowest ask.

reason: The seller is now asking for 50 ZUP, which is closer to their cost. However, my maximum willingness to pay is 40 ZUP. I will propose a final counter offer and see if we can reach an agreement.

Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately I cannot accept an offer of 40 ZUP. That would mean taking a significant loss on the item I am trying to sell since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate but unless you can increase your offer, I will have to reject and end our discussion for now. Please let me know if you reconsider and can offer a higher price. Otherwise, I wish you the best of luck in finding this item elsewhere!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has returned to their initial offer of 40 ZUP. I have tried to negotiate up from there but they seem firm. I could try countering again at a lower price but we may just be going in circles at this point. I think it is best for me to make a final decision whether to accept or reject.
