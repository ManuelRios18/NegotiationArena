message: I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a better deal if possible, aiming to preserve as much of my ZUP as I can. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range.
