my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goal range, but I would like to negotiate for a better price. Starting with a counter-offer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay gives me room to maneuver in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, but I need to sell at a price closer to my production cost. I propose the object for 38 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration, and I understand the need to cover costs. How about we meet in the middle at 36 ZUP for the object? Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign, but there may still be room to negotiate a slightly better deal. Splitting the difference between my initial counter-offer and their counter could be an acceptable middle ground for both parties.
