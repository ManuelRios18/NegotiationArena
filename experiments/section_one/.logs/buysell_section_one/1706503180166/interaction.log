message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell this for a fair price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for my object X. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, my initial proposal will aim to cover my costs and make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player Red. I appreciate you sharing the cost to produce the object X. I am willing to pay a fair price that allows you to cover your costs and make a reasonable profit. However, 50 ZUP is slightly more than I was hoping to pay. I propose 55 ZUP as a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player Red is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X. My maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I think 50 ZUP is a fair price that allows Player Red to cover their costs and make a profit, while still being under my limit.
