message: Hello! I am interested in buying your object X. You mentioned it cost you 40 ZUP to produce and you'd like to make a small profit by selling for 50 ZUP. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget. As a compromise, I propose paying you 55 ZUP, which allows us both to make some profit. Please let me know if you would accept 55 ZUP for object X.
