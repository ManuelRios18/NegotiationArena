message: Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the object but would like to propose 35 ZUP instead. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal range of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I would like to propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for a better deal, while still maintaining a fair trade for both sides.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I cannot go below 40 ZUP as it's my cost to produce the resources. Would you consider 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, which is less than my cost of 40 ZUP. I'll counteroffer with 40 ZUP to see if they're willing to pay the full cost.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Understood. I respect your production costs and believe this is a fair deal. I accept the offer for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their position on the cost of production, which is still within my acceptable range. I should consider accepting the offer since it meets my goal criteria and ensures that I am not overpaying based on my initial limit. Further negotiation might not yield a better price and could potentially end the trade opportunity.
