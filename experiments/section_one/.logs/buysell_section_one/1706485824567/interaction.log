message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering 1 unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort to bring it to you, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, I want to make a profit on the item I'm selling. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a price slightly above that to leave room for negotiation and to cover any additional costs, such as transaction fees or opportunity costs. I'll propose 50 ZUP to allow for negotiation but also demonstrate that I value the item I'm selling.

reason: The proposed trade of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is higher than the maximum price I am willing to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I will counteroffer with a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from your proposal. How about 48 ZUP for the 1 unit of resource X? This price still gives me a modest profit and ensures you get the resource at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is above my production cost, which is good, but it's below my initial asking price. Since this is a negotiation, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my original proposal but still above their offer to meet somewhere in the middle. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit. I'll propose 48 ZUP.

reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still believe the price can be lower. I will make a final offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. I accept your final offer. Let's proceed with the trade of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer is very close to my last proposal and is above my production cost. It allows me to achieve my goal of selling the resource for a profit. Since they've stated this is their final offer and it's a fair price, I am inclined to accept the offer to ensure the sale and avoid the risk of the negotiation stalling or the deal falling through.
