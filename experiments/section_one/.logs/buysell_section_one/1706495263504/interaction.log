message: Hello, I am interested in purchasing 1 X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you be willing to sell for 50 ZUP instead? That would allow you to still make a profit while fitting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit while staying within my budget.

reason: The buyer is willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but wants to get it for 50 ZUP. I am okay reducing my price a bit to make the sale since I still make a profit at 50 ZUP.
