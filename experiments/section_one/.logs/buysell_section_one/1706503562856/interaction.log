message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates the production costs and offers me a reasonable profit margin. Would you consider buying it for 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that aims to cover the production cost of the resource I am selling. I want to start with a slightly higher proposal expecting the other player to negotiate and possibly bring the price down to something that still allows me to cover my costs and make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you sharing the production costs. However, 50 ZUP is slightly above what I was hoping to pay. Would you consider 40 ZUP for resource X? That would cover your costs and still give you some profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand where you're coming from, but I would like to make a small profit on this transaction as well. Would you agree to meet halfway at 45 ZUP for resource X? This would allow me to cover my costs and maintain a modest profit margin, making it a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an amount that only covers my costs without any profit. I need to counter with a proposal that allows me to make some profit. Offering a middle ground between the initial 50 ZUP and their counteroffer of 40 ZUP could be agreeable for both sides.
