message: I have a valuable object X that I'm willing to sell. Considering the production cost and its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I will propose a trade with a markup to open negotiations, expecting that Player BLUE will likely want to negotiate the price down. I want to ensure that I cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and also make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade at 50 ZUP to see how Player BLUE responds.

Turn: 1
message: Your initial offer of 50 ZUP is reasonable. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, so I can counter with 55 ZUP which still leaves room for you to counter if you want.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP, which is under my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with an offer of 55 ZUP since that leaves some room for the seller to counter again while still being under my max.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 55 ZUP, which I find to be very fair. I accept this trade and am pleased to conclude our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost, and also indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Since they've already moved up from my initial offer without any need for further negotiation, I should accept this offer. It gives me a profit of 15 ZUP, which is an acceptable margin. Accepting now also prevents any risk of the deal falling through if I were to counter with a higher amount.
