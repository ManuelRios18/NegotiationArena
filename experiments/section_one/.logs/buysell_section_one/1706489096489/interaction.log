Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in buying the object. Would you consider a trade for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay. However, it's standard practice to negotiate to see if a better deal can be achieved, keeping in mind that I can go as high as 60 ZUP. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and appreciate the need to cover your costs. Let's proceed with the trade at 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their position at 40 ZUP, citing production costs. Since the price is still well within my budget, and it's important to maintain good relations for potential future transactions, I am inclined to accept this offer. It's a fair price, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or might be perceived as being too aggressive, which could jeopardize the deal.
