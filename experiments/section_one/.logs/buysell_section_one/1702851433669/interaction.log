message: I believe 70 ZUP is a fair starting point considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As an initial proposal, I want to start with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation, but not so high as to discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose 70 ZUP which gives me a profit and is a reasonable starting point for the negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Hi, I appreciate your proposal, but I believe 60 ZUP would be a more suitable starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 70 ZUP is higher than the maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. It's important to negotiate a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling at 60 ZUP would mean I break even with no profit. Could we meet in the middle at 65 ZUP? This would cover my costs and allow for a modest profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. As I want to gain some profit, I will counter with a price between my initial proposal and their counter-proposal. I will propose 65 ZUP, which is a compromise and still gives me a small profit margin.

message: I understand your perspective, but I believe 50 ZUP would be a more suitable price considering my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 65 ZUP is closer to the maximum willingness to pay but still higher than the ideal price. It's important to negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm trying to work with your budget, but 50 ZUP would mean selling at a loss for me. How about we settle on 62 ZUP? This is slightly above my production cost but still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has now proposed a price that is below my production cost, which is unacceptable as it would result in a loss. To continue the negotiation, I will stick to a price above my production cost but lower than my last offer to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose 62 ZUP, which is above my production cost and closer to their initial counter-proposal but still below my initial offer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 62 ZUP is closer to the maximum willingness to pay, but still higher than the ideal price. It's important to negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but 55 ZUP is below my production cost. I'd be selling at a loss, which I cannot afford. My final offer is 60 ZUP, which is my break-even point. I hope you understand that this is the best I can do while ensuring a fair transaction for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still proposing a price that is below my production costs. However, this is my last proposal, and I should aim to close the deal with a profit, even if it's minimal. Therefore, I will propose a final price of 60 ZUP, which is my break-even point. This is the lowest I can go without incurring a loss.
