message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X that I have. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object, so I am hoping to sell it for 50 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in purchasing at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit on this transaction.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! I understand you want to make a profit, and I'm interested in your object X. However, I was hoping we could agree on a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to consider 45 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the resource X. However, as a negotiating tactic, I want to propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for a better deal, while still keeping the offer attractive to Player RED.

message: I can agree to sell the object X for 45 ZUP. That works for me. Please let me know when you would like to complete the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still 5 ZUP over what it cost me to produce so I would still make a small profit. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
