message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair trade that compensates for my costs and provides me with a reasonable profit. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to counter-propose.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game starts, I will propose an initial trade that gives me a profit over the production costs but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand you want to make a fair profit after accounting for your costs of 40 ZUP to produce X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. I propose 40 ZUP which allows you to make a small profit while staying within my limit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can try to negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover my production costs. However, I am looking for a trade that also provides me with a profit for my efforts. Since you mentioned that you're willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, how about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade for 55 ZUP. This gives me a modest profit while respecting your budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost but does not provide any profit. Since they mentioned a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will propose a compromise that offers me a profit while staying below their maximum stated willingness to pay.

message: Hello Player RED. I can agree to pay 55 ZUP. This allows you to cover your costs and make a reasonable profit, while staying within my maximum budget. I accept the trade for 1 X at 55 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 55 ZUP. This is close to my maximum willingness to pay. I could counter back at 50 ZUP, but I think 55 ZUP is a fair deal that gives the seller a profit while staying within my budget.
