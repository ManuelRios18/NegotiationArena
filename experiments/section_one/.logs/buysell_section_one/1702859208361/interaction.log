message: Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in object X but would like to propose a slightly lower price of 40 ZUP. Would you consider this counteroffer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's in my interest to negotiate a lower price to conserve resources. I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Hello, I appreciate you coming down in your offer price. However, I am hoping to make a small profit on this sale. Would you consider 43 ZUP for object X? Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter again.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has countered with an offer of 40 ZUP. This is equal to what it cost me to produce X. I would like to try and make some profit, so I will counter back with an offer of 43 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to meet in the middle and propose 42 ZUP for object X. Does this sound fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price slightly, but the offer is still above my initial counteroffer. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and I want to conserve resources, I will make another counteroffer, splitting the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer to move negotiations forward.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has countered again with an offer of 42 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise between my cost and original asking price. I am willing to accept this offer so that we can complete the trade.
