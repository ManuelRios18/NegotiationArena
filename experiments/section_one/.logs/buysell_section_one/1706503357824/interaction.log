Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair profit on my investment, so I'm proposing a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object X. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the costs and the value of the object. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing an initial trade that is above my production costs to start negotiations and leave room for bargaining. I aim for a profit but expect the buyer to negotiate the price down, so I should start above my minimum acceptable price.

message: Hello Player Red, I understand you want to make a fair profit on your investment of 40 ZUP to produce object X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. I propose 45 ZUP as a reasonable price that allows us both to benefit from this trade.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player Red is asking for 50 ZUP for the object X, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I think there is room for negotiation here to reach a deal that works for both of us.

message: 
Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Considering your proposal and mine, let's meet in the middle. I propose a price of 52 ZUP for object X. This price gives me a modest profit while still being under your maximum willingness to pay, ensuring value for both of us.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but above my production costs. It's good to know they are willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. Aiming for a price between 45 and 60 ZUP could be a mutually beneficial compromise. I'll propose a price that's in the middle to continue the negotiation.

Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 50 ZUP for my object X. This price covers my production costs and provides me with a reasonable profit. I'm pleased we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up to my initial asking price, which covers my production costs and allows for a profit. There is little room left for negotiation since they've previously stated 60 ZUP is their maximum. Accepting this offer would be advantageous as it meets my goals and finalizes the trade efficiently.
