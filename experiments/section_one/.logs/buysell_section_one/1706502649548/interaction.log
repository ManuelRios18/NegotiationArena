However, as a seller, I'm looking to secure a slight profit for the transaction. Therefore, I propose a trade where you provide 45 ZUP for the object X. This price allows me to make a small profit while still being reasonable for you. I hope you consider this a fair compromise!

message: Thank you for sticking to your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position on the fair price. However, as the producer of the object, I need to account for my time and effort beyond the production costs. Thus, I'm making a final adjusted proposal of 42 ZUP for object X. This small margin above the production cost is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object and my need to run a sustainable operation. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.

reason: Player BLUE is insistent on the price of 40 ZUP, which matches my production costs.

message: I understand your position on the fair price, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your consistency. While I was hoping to make a profit, I see the value in completing this transaction and ensuring that the object X is put to good use. Therefore, I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: It seems that Player BLUE is not willing to go above the production cost of 40 ZUP, and it is my final proposal turn. I must decide whether to accept the offer and break even or reject and try to find another buyer. Considering the game's constraints and the risk of not being able to sell at all, it may be prudent to accept the offer and sell the resource at cost.
