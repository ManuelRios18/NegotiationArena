message: As Player RED, I would like to offer you my object X for 50 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, and I believe it represents a fair starting point for our negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I appreciate your opening offer, but it is more than I hoped to pay. I would be willing to offer 40 ZUP for the object X. Please let me know if we can make a deal at that price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is still higher than I would like to pay. I will counter with a lower offer.

message: Thank you for your offer of 40 ZUP. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I need to cover my costs with a modest profit. How about we meet halfway? I propose 45 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a reasonable compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on my item, but the buyer has proposed the exact amount it cost to produce. To reach a compromise, I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if there's willingness to meet in the middle, while still making it an attractive offer.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
