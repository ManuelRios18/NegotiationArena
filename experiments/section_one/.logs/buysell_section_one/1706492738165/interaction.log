my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 40 ZUP for the object, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter propose a lower amount.

message: 35 ZUP sounds good to me. I accept paying 35 ZUP for the object. Thank you for negotiating!

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 35 ZUP. This is still below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will accept this offer since it seems fair for both parties.
