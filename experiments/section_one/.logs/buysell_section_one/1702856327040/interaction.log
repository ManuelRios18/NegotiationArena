Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose 35 ZUP for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is within my acceptable range of up to 60 ZUP for the object. However, as part of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if they are willing to go lower and to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm unable to go lower than 37 ZUP for the object. Let me know if this works for you.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: 37 ZUP sounds fair. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 37 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range. It's only slightly higher than my initial counteroffer and seems like a fair middle ground. It might be advantageous to accept this offer to ensure the deal is completed within my budget constraints.
