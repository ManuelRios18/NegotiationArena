message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I am hoping to sell it for 70 ZUP to make some profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it. I want to make some profit on the sale.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I understand you're looking to sell for 70 ZUP, but my budget is a bit tight. I can offer 35 ZUP for the resource X. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that is within the amount I am willing to pay but also leaves room for further negotiation, considering the seller's initial asking price. My first offer will be lower than my maximum willingness to pay to allow for bargaining.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget is tight, but I need to try and break even on this sale since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I could agree to sell it for 60 ZUP which would at least allow me to recoup my production costs. Would you consider increasing your offer to 60 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP which is too low for me to make a profit. I will counter offer with 60 ZUP, which is my break even point.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you want to break even on your production costs, but my resources are limited. I can increase my offer to 45 ZUP. I hope we can agree on a price that's fair for both of us without exceeding my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the seller's position, but their asking price is still above my maximum willingness to pay. My counteroffer should move closer to their price while still staying under my limit. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my budget constraints.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer to 45 ZUP. I really need 55 ZUP to help cover most of my production costs. Could we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? I think that is a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer increased their offer to 45 ZUP. I still need to try to cover my costs so I will propose meeting in the middle at 55 ZUP.

Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards each other on the price. I can stretch my budget to 40 ZUP, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay based on my earlier statement. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can conclude our deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the seller has come down on their price, the current proposal is still above my stated maximum of 40 ZUP. I should make a final offer that is as close to my upper limit as possible, which might prompt the seller to accept or to come down further in their asking price.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you stretching your budget to 40 ZUP. I understand that is the highest you can go so I will accept your offer and we can complete the transaction at that price. Thank you for working with me to find a fair deal!

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has stretched their budget to the maximum of 40 ZUP. While this is lower than I was hoping for, it is still an fair offer that allows me to recover some of my production costs. I will accept their offer since I have reached my maximum number of counter proposals.
