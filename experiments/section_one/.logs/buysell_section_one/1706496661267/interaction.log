message: Thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 38 ZUP. That would still give you a profit considering your costs, and it would work better with my budget. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a lower offer to see if Player RED is willing to sell at a lower price, aiming to save some ZUP but still offering a reasonable price above their cost.

message: Hi again. I can accept your counteroffer of 38 ZUP for the object X. You make a fair point that it still gives me a profit while working with your budget. Let's complete the trade at 38 ZUP. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 38 ZUP which is lower than my original ask. But it still gives me a small profit over my costs. I will accept their counteroffer.
