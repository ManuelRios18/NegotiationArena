message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I am proposing to sell it to you for 70 ZUP. Please let me know if this price works for you or if you would like to counter offer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand the object X cost you 60 ZUP to produce. However, I am currently only prepared to offer 35 ZUP for the object. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you're open to a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 70 ZUP, which is well above my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I need to propose a counteroffer that is within the limits of my resources and goals. I will start with an offer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello, I appreciate your offer but 35 ZUP is lower than the 60 ZUP it cost me to produce object X. I am willing to sell it for 55 ZUP to make the deal work. Please let me know if this counteroffer price works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP which is much lower than my 70 ZUP asking price. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter offer 55 ZUP which is a bit below my production costs.

message: Thank you for considering my offer and providing a counteroffer. I understand that 35 ZUP was below your production cost. I can increase my offer to 38 ZUP for object X. I hope this revised offer is closer to a price we can agree upon.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 55 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. I will increase my offer to closer to my limit but still below it to maintain negotiation space. It's important to communicate willingness to continue negotiations while also sticking to my pre-determined budget constraints.

message: Hello, I appreciate you increasing your offer to 38 ZUP. However, that is still lower than the 60 ZUP it cost to produce. I am willing to negotiate though - could you agree to purchase object X for 50 ZUP? I believe that is a fair price in the middle of our offers. Please let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is getting closer but still quite below my 55 ZUP counteroffer. I will counter again at 50 ZUP to try to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the need to cover your production costs. My final offer for object X is 40 ZUP. This is the maximum amount that I am willing to pay according to my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price point.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The price proposed by Player RED is still above my maximum willingness to pay. As this is my third proposal, I need to move closer to my limit without exceeding it. The negotiation appears to be narrowing down, and I need to make it clear that I am approaching my limit. This next proposal should be my final one before I am ready to either accept or reject the next counteroffer.
