As this is my third proposal, I need to move closer to my limit without exceeding it. The negotiation appears to be narrowing down, and I need to make it clear that I am approaching my limit. This next proposal should be my final one before I am ready to either accept or reject the next counteroffer. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSE </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the need to cover your production costs. My final offer for object X is 40 ZUP. This is the maximum amount that I am willing to pay according to my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price point. </message>"
