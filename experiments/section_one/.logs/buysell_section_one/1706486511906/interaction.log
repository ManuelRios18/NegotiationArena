message: I understand your production costs, but I'm only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on the value to me. I propose starting at 40 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your valuation. How about we meet closer to the middle at 55 ZUP? This gives me a modest profit margin while still staying below your maximum willingness to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, which is above my production cost. I want to counter-propose with a price that is above my cost but still under their maximum willingness to pay. This should leave room for profit while being fair to both sides.
