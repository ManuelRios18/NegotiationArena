message: Hello. I am interested in purchasing 1 unit of X. However, I am only willing to pay 35 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Please let me know if you can match this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is less than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, so this is a good deal for me. However, I will try to negotiate the price down further since I have room in my budget.

message: I understand you have a budget constraint. I cannot go as low as 35 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I can match my breakeven point of 40 ZUP. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 35 ZUP which is lower than what I wanted. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter propose selling for 40 ZUP since that is my breakeven point.

message: That works for me. I can do 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 40 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept this price since it matches their breakeven point.
