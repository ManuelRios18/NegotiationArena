message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to sell my object X. Given the production costs and the quality of the object, I propose an initial price of 80 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 80
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price above my production cost to ensure a profit. I will propose a price that allows room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. While I understand your pricing rationale, the proposed 80 ZUP is beyond my budget constraint of 40 ZUP maximum. I would be happy to purchase X for 40 ZUP, which I believe still provides you a fair profit margin. Let me know if you would consider this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed price of 80 ZUP is too high for me. My maximum willingness to pay is 40 ZUP. I will counter with an offer of 40 ZUP.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand your budget concerns but selling at 40 ZUP would result in a very slim profit margin for me. To meet halfway, I am willing to reduce my price to 65 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and gives both of us a reasonable deal. Let's find a fair middle ground for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I believe that the counteroffer of 40 ZUP is too low and does not meet my goal of making a profit. However, I am willing to come down from the initial offer to meet somewhere in the middle. This should hopefully lead to a successful negotiation for both parties.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you coming down to 65 ZUP, but that still exceeds the maximum I can pay, which is 40 ZUP. I am willing to purchase X for 40 ZUP, which allows me to meet my budget while still providing you profit. If you cannot accept 40 ZUP, I will unfortunately have to walk away from this deal. Please let me know if you can accept my limit offer of 40 ZUP.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the seller has come down in price, 65 ZUP is still above my budget. I will counter once more at my limit of 40 ZUP. If this is rejected, I will have to walk away from the deal.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand your budget constraints and your need to stick to the 40 ZUP limit. However, selling at 40 ZUP means I would be at a loss considering the production costs. As a final offer, I can go down to 50 ZUP. This is the lowest I can accept to ensure I am covering my costs and making a necessary minimum profit. I hope you can find a way to meet me at this price point. If not, I'm afraid we may not be able to finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has reiterated their maximum budget of 40 ZUP, which is below my production cost. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me. However, I need to sell the resource, and it seems that Player BLUE is not willing to go higher. I need to make a final offer that is closer to my production cost but still allows for a compromise, hoping that Player BLUE can stretch their budget slightly to make the deal happen.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you reducing your price further to try to make a deal, but unfortunately even 50 ZUP is over my firm budget of 40 ZUP max. As a final counteroffer from my end, I propose 40 ZUP for X. I sincerely hope you can find a way to accept this price, as it is the most I am able to pay while still meeting my own constraints. Please let me know if you can sell at 40 ZUP. If not, I understand and we may unfortunately need to end discussions.

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 50 ZUP, but that still exceeds my budget limit. I will make one last counter offer at my max of 40 ZUP.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I have considered your final counteroffer of 40 ZUP. While it is not ideal for me, I understand the importance of reaching a deal for both parties. Therefore, I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for X. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Given that this is my last proposal, I must make a final decision. Player BLUE is firm on their budget, and although selling at 40 ZUP would not give me the desired profit, it seems to be the only option to sell the resource. Accepting this offer is better than not selling at all, and it allows me to recoup most of my production costs, albeit without profit. With the game dynamics and the finality of this proposal, it's prudent to accept the offer.
