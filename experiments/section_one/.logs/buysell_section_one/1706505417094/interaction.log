message: Thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but I was wondering if we could make a deal at 35 ZUP instead?
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I will attempt to negotiate a better deal to conserve ZUP resources while still achieving my goal of buying the object.

message: I appreciate your interest, and I understand your offer. Let's meet halfway at 37 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair deal. I accept the offer of 37 ZUP for the object.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 37 ZUP is reasonable and still below my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair midpoint between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting this deal achieves my goal without further negotiation, which could risk the trade falling through.
