message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand you want to make a profit, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for 1 X. This is a bit closer to what I was looking to spend. Let's find a price that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
