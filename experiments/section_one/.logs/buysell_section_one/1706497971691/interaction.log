message: Hello. I appreciate you sharing the production cost of 40 ZUP. I am willing to pay 50 ZUP which allows you to make a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is above the 40 ZUP production cost mentioned by the seller. I will counter with 50 ZUP since it leaves room for the seller to make a small profit.
