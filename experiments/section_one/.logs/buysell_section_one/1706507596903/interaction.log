message: I'm definitely interested in buying 1 unit of X. However, I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to sell it for 42 ZUP? This would still give you a small profit and make the deal more aligned with my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that my maximum willing price is 60 ZUP and the seller is asking for 45 ZUP, there is room for negotiation to lower the price. I want to propose a price that is lower than their asking price but still gives them a profit on their cost to produce.

message: Hi, I understand you were hoping to pay less than 45 ZUP. As a compromise, would you be willing to purchase the 1 unit of X for 43 ZUP? This allows me to still make a small profit while aligning closer to your budget. Please let me know if 43 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 42 ZUP instead of my asking price of 45 ZUP. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP as a compromise.

message: The price of 43 ZUP works for me. I appreciate you coming closer to my budget and am happy to finalize this deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's counteroffer of 43 ZUP is very close to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since the difference is only 1 ZUP and it allows the seller to maintain a profit, it seems reasonable to accept this offer to secure the resource and maintain a good trading relationship.
