Turn: 0
message: I understand you are only willing to pay 40 ZUP. However, I cannot accept less than my breakeven cost of 60 ZUP. As a compromise, I propose selling the X for 50 ZUP. This allows me to make a small profit while giving you a discount from my original ask. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is only willing to pay 40 ZUP, which is below my breakeven cost of 60 ZUP. I would lose 20 ZUP by accepting. I will counter propose selling for 50 ZUP which is in between.

message: I appreciate you coming down in price, but 40 ZUP is truly the maximum I can pay based on my goals. Can you accept 40 ZUP and we have a deal?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 60 ZUP to 50 ZUP, but that still exceeds my limit of 40 ZUP. I will counter again with my maximum of 40 ZUP.

message: I understand 40 ZUP is your best offer. I accept and we have a deal for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has reiterated they can only pay 40 ZUP. While this means I lose 20 ZUP, it seems they cannot pay more. I'd rather take the loss and make the sale than be stuck with unsold inventory.
