message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am interested in selling. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while providing you with the valuable resource you need. Let's negotiate a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly above my production cost, which gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit. I'm proposing 50 ZUP, which gives me a room of 10 ZUP above my costs.
