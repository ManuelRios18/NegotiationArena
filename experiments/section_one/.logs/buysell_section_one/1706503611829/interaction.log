message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production cost and value, I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer if needed.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource which cost 40 ZUP to produce, I will start the negotiation by asking for a higher amount than my cost to leave room for negotiation. I'll propose 50 ZUP to begin with.

message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for the offer. 50 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to pay 40 ZUP for object X. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum willingness to pay. Please let me know if you can accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since it is close to my limit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. However, selling at cost doesn't cover my expenses for future production and profit. Let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP for object X? This should be a good deal for both of us, considering the quality and production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly the production cost of my object X. However, selling at cost would not yield any profit. I will counter-propose with a slightly lower price than my initial ask but higher than the production cost to attempt to make a profit. I'll propose 45 ZUP.
