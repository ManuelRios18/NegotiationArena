message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I'm willing to sell. I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair price considering the production cost and the value it offers. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, X, for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. To start the negotiation, I will propose a price higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price to maximize my savings.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. While I understand your budget considerations, I'm sure you can appreciate the quality and value of resource X. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This price takes into account both the production cost and the quality of the resource, ensuring a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. However, I would like to make a profit on this deal. I will counter with a slightly reduced price from my initial offer, but still above my cost, to move the negotiation forward and aim for a profit.

message: Thank you for your new proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're coming to an agreement. Let's split the difference once more. I propose 43 ZUP for resource X. This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring I cover my costs with a modest profit, and you get the resource X within your budget. I hope this can conclude our negotiation successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which gives me a small profit. It's a reasonable compromise between my last offer and their counter-offer. I should consider accepting this to secure a deal, but I will attempt one last negotiation to see if I can increase the profit margin slightly, while still closing the deal.
