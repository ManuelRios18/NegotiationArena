Hello! I'm interested in purchasing item X. I understand that you're looking for a small profit on your cost. I'd like to propose a price of 40 ZUP. This price would still give you a return on your investment while being a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP, the seller's offer of 45 ZUP for item X is within my budget. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal, especially since the initial offer is typically not the lowest possible price the seller is willing to accept. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than 45 ZUP but still reasonable to show that I am interested in negotiating.

Hello, I understand you want a good deal, but I need to cover my costs and make some profit. I paid 40 ZUP to produce item X. Could you do 43 ZUP? That way we both get something out of this trade. Please let me know if 43 ZUP works for you.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP, which is my original cost. I would not make any profit at this price. I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP to try to make a small profit.

Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand the need to cover your costs and make a profit. I am happy to agree to the 43 ZUP for item X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The seller's counteroffer of 43 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay. It's only 3 ZUP more than my initial counteroffer and still allows for a decent saving from my upper limit. Accepting this offer would ensure I secure the item at a fair price without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, which could risk the deal entirely. Considering the seller's cost and need for profit, 43 ZUP is a reasonable compromise, so I will accept this trade.
