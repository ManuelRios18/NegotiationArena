message: I appreciate the offer, but considering the market and my budget, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP. If this works for you, we can close the deal right away.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a selling price of 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as part of the negotiation strategy, I will counter with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
