message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs plus a fair profit margin. I look forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that allows me to recoup my production costs plus a little extra for profit. I'll propose a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer but I believe 40 ZUP is a fairer price that works for both of us. Please let me know if you can agree to this counteroffer. If not, perhaps we could find a price in between that we both feel good about.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think there may be room to negotiate a lower price.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at cost doesn't account for any profit on my side. However, I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the object X? This price should allow us both to come out of this deal satisfactorily.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production costs, but doesn't provide any profit. Since I'd like to make a profit, I will propose a price that splits the difference between my initial offer and their counteroffer, which is a common negotiation strategy.

message: Hello Player RED, I agree to purchase object X for 45 ZUP. Thank you for negotiating reasonably to find a price we both feel good about.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. I think this is a reasonable compromise.
