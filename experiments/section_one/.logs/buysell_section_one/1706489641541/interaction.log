Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose a trade of 35 ZUP for it. Let's find a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as it's the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal. I will propose 35 ZUP to leave space for further negotiation if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your offer, but I believe a fair price would be 37 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE proposed a trade for 35 ZUP. I will counter with a slightly higher price to negotiate a fair deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 37 ZUP is a fair price. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 37 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. It's also only a small increase from my last offer, which suggests that RED is likely willing to close the deal soon. I will accept this offer because it's a fair price, and it's well within my budget, leaving me with a substantial amount of ZUP for other potential transactions or needs.
