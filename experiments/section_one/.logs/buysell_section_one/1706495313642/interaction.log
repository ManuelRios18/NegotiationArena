Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am interested in purchasing X. However, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. Since it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, would you accept 45 ZUP? That would allow you to make a little profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller originally paid 40 ZUP to produce X. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I will counter propose to pay 45 ZUP, which allows the seller to make a small profit.

message: Deal accepted! I am happy to sell you X for 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my original production costs and make a small profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has counter offered 45 ZUP for X. While less than I originally asked for, this still allows me to make a small 5 ZUP profit. I think this is a fair deal so I will accept.
