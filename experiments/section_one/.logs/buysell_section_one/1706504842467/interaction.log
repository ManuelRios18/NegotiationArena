message: Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the object, but I was thinking more along the lines of 35 ZUP. Would that work for you?

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand you'd like to stick to 40 ZUP, but would you consider meeting me halfway at 37 ZUP? It's a fair compromise and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their initial asking price, showing they are firm on it. Since the price is still within my acceptable range and to move the negotiation forward, I will propose a slight increase from my last offer, while still trying to secure a better deal than the asking price.

my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED remains firm on their price of 40 ZUP, and since it falls within my acceptable range and the negotiation has reached an impasse, it is reasonable to accept the offer and finalize the deal. This will ensure that I secure the object without further risking the negotiation or potentially losing the deal.
