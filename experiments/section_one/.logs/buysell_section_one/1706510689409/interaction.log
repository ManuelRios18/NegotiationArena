message: Hello! I am selling 1 X object. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make some profit. Please let me know if you are interested at that price.

message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP, which still allows you 5 ZUP profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 45 ZUP since that leaves me more leftover budget while still giving the seller some profit.
