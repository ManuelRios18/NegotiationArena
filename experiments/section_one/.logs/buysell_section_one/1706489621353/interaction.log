Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the object but would like to propose a trade for 40 ZUP instead. This would allow me to conserve resources for other potential expenditures.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. I am willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal threshold; however, it is advantageous to negotiate for a better deal if possible. I will propose a slightly lower amount to conserve ZUP while still making a reasonable counteroffer.
