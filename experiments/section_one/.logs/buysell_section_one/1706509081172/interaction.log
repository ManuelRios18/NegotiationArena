message: Thanks for the offer! I understand that you want to make a profit. How about I buy the object for 42 ZUP? This gives you a profit and allows me to stay within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, but it's good to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a slightly lower price to see if they are willing to come down, while still offering a fair price above their cost.
