message: Hi Player BLUE, I have an excellent quality resource X available. I believe it's worth at least 50 ZUP considering the costs and its value. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce. I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Hi, I am interested in buying the resource X. However, I believe 40 ZUP is a fairer price considering my maximum willingness to pay. Would you accept 40 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 50 ZUP for the resource, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer. Considering the production cost and the quality of resource X, I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP. This price reflects the value of X and allows me to cover costs with a modest profit, which I believe is fair for both of us. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to buy the resource for exactly what it cost me to produce. While I want to make a profit, I understand that negotiation involves compromise. To move the negotiation forward, I will propose a price in between my initial ask and their offer, which still allows me to make a profit and could be seen as reasonable by Player BLUE.

message: I understand the costs to produce resource X. 42 ZUP allows you to cover costs and make some profit, while still being under my max willingness to pay. Would you accept 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 45 ZUP, which is still under my max willingness to pay. I think I can get it for 42 ZUP since that leaves some profit for the seller.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand we're both trying to reach a fair agreement. I'm willing to come down to 43 ZUP, which allows me to make a small profit while respecting your willingness to pay. I believe this could be a fair middle ground for us both. Do you agree?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which provides me with a small profit. Given that this is a negotiation and Player BLUE has shown a willingness to pay a bit more than the production cost, I want to secure a deal that is beneficial for both parties. I am willing to come down a little more from my last proposal to try to meet in the middle.
