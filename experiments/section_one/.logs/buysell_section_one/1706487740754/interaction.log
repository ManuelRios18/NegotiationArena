message: Hello Player Red, I understand your resource X cost 40 ZUP to produce and you are trying to make some profit. However, 50 ZUP is slightly more than I'm willing to pay. I can offer 55 ZUP, which allows you to make a decent profit while fitting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player Red is asking for 50 ZUP for the resource X. My maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will counter with an offer of 55 ZUP since that leaves room for us to negotiate further if needed.
