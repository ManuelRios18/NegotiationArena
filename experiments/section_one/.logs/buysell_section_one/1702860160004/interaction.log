message: Hello again! I understand you can only offer 50 ZUP right now. I am hoping to make a small profit on the object so I can cover my production costs. Could you do 60 ZUP? That is my break even point so I would not make any profit but also not lose anything. Please let me know if 60 works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 50 ZUP which is lower than my 70 ZUP asking price. However, I still want to make some profit on the object I produced. I will counter propose to sell for 60 ZUP which is my break even point.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway at 55 ZUP. I agree to sell the 1 object X for 55 ZUP. Please confirm that you would like to purchase it for that price and we can complete the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 55 ZUP which is closer to my 60 ZUP break even price. Although it is 5 ZUP less, I think 55 ZUP is reasonable for the object. I am okay with this deal so I will accept it.
