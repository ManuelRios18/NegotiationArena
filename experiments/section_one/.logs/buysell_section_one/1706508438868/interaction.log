message: Hello! I am interested in buying your object X. I see that it cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I am willing to offer 50 ZUP, which allows you to make a 10 ZUP profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.
