message: Thank you for your offer! I understand that you want to make a profit. However, my budget is a bit tight, and I was hoping to spend around 40 ZUP for the resource. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resource for at most 60 ZUP and the seller's initial asking price is 45 ZUP, there is an opportunity to negotiate a better deal closer to my target. Starting at a lower price will give some room for bargaining while keeping the final price within my willing to pay limit.

message: I can meet you at 40 ZUP for the X resource since that covers my production costs. Let's complete the trade at your proposed 40 ZUP price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has proposed to purchase the X resource for 40 ZUP, which is my breakeven price. I would be making no profit at this price, but since I already incurred the production cost, breakeven is better than taking a loss. I will accept selling at their proposed price.
