message: Hello! I am interested in buying the object X. Your asking price of 45 ZUP is a bit high for me. I am willing to pay 50 ZUP, which allows us both to make some profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for us both to profit.
