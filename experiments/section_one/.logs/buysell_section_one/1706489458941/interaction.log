message: Hello Player RED, I am interested in the object. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the object. Can we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal of 40 ZUP is within my willingness to pay, but it is my goal to acquire the resource at a lower cost if possible. It's beneficial to start the negotiation with a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and possibly secure a better deal.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I believe 38 ZUP is a fair price for the object. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is below the production cost. I will counteroffer with 38 ZUP, which is a compromise between our initial proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 38 ZUP, Player RED. I would like to meet you halfway from my initial counteroffer and propose 36 ZUP for the object. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still within my acceptable range, but it might still be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal. However, I should also consider that this is a reasonable price, and further haggling could risk the deal. Making a small concession could lead to an agreement that is beneficial for both parties.

reason: Player BLUE has proposed 36 ZUP, which is closer to the midpoint. I will accept this offer as it is reasonable and allows me to sell the object without incurring a significant loss.
