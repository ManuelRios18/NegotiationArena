message: I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this high-quality object. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the costs and effort involved. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I aim to propose a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit. This also gives me some room to negotiate with Player BLUE.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you sharing the costs involved. However, 50 ZUP is higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider 40 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has invested 40 ZUP into the object and is asking for 50 ZUP, which seems high compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but selling at 40 ZUP leaves me with no profit. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial price. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This would cover my costs and allow for a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would not make a profit. I should counter with a price above the production cost to ensure profit but still consider their willingness to pay.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, 45 ZUP seems fair. I accept your proposal to meet in the middle.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum of 60 ZUP. I will accept meeting in the middle as a reasonable compromise.
