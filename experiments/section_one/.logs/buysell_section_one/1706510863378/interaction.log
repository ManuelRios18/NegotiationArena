message: Hello. I am interested in buying the X. However, I am not willing to pay 45 ZUP based on my budget. I can offer 35 ZUP, which allows you to still make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: Hello again. I understand you have a budget to keep in mind. I can agree to sell the X for 40 ZUP which would just cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. This way I do not make any profit but I also do not take any loss. Would you agree to purchase X for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 35 ZUP. While this allows me to make a small profit, it is lower than what I was hoping for based on my costs. I will counter offer selling X for 40 ZUP, which covers my costs.
