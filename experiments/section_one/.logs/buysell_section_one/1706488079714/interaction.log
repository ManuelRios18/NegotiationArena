message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This is a little above my production costs, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I will aim a bit higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and possibly gain a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate you starting the negotiations. However, 40 ZUP is the highest I can offer and remain within my maximum budget. Please let me know if you can agree to that price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with an offer of 40 ZUP to see if I can get a better deal.

message: I understand your budget constraints, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking to make at least a small profit on my investment. Would you be able to meet me halfway at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X? This is a compromise between our initial proposals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal matches my production costs, which means I would break even but not make a profit. I will counter-propose with a slightly higher amount to try and secure a small profit while still remaining close to Player BLUE's maximum budget.
