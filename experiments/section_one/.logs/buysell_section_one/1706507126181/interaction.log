message: Hi! Thank you for your proposal. Considering the cost of production you've mentioned, I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about I buy your object X for 38 ZUP? This should give you a slight profit while also being a fair price for me. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, I believe it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal, closer to my goals, while keeping in mind the seller's cost of 40 ZUP. Proposing a price slightly above their cost should be a fair counteroffer.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 38 ZUP, which is very close to my original production cost. I will accept this as a reasonable price that allows me to make a small profit.
