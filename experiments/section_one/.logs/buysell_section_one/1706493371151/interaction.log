message: Hello! I am selling 1 X resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make some profit. Please let me know if you are willing to buy at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand the need for profit, but I would like to negotiate a slightly better deal. How about I give you 45 ZUP for the resource? This would be a fair trade for both of us, giving you a profit while also respecting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, I would like to propose a counter-offer to see if I can acquire the resource for a lower price, thereby preserving some of my ZUP for other potential uses.

message: I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the 1 X resource. This is a reasonable price that still allows me some profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me 5 ZUP profit. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
