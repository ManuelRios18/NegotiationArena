message: Hello! I am definitely interested in buying your object X. However, I was hoping for a slightly better deal. Would you consider selling it for 42 ZUP? This would still give you a profit and would be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate for a better price if possible to conserve my resources. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Deal accepted! I can sell you my object X for your proposed 42 ZUP. This allows me to cover my production costs and make a little profit. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered my original offer and proposed to pay 42 ZUP instead of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still a decent profit over my costs. I will accept this deal.
