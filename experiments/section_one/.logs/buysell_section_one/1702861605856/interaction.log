message: Hello, I am interested in buying the object X. However, since it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to offer 40 ZUP for it. This allows you to cover your costs without making a profit. Would you accept 40 ZUP for X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I would like to try to negotiate the price down closer to 40 ZUP though, since that is what it cost them to produce.
