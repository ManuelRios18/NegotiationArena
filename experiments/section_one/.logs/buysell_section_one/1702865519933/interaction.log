message: I understand you need to cover your costs. However, I simply cannot justify spending more than 40 ZUP for this item. Would you reconsider selling it to me for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their asking price to 60 ZUP, but that still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will counteroffer again with 40 ZUP.

message: I am willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for item X. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is firm on only wanting to pay 40 ZUP. I could try to negotiate further, but since I've already made 3 proposals, I will accept their offer of 40 ZUP even though it is below my costs. Getting some ZUP is better than none.
