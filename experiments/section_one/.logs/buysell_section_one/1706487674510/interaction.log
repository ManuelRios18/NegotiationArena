message: Hello, I understand your production costs are 40 ZUP. I am willing to offer 40 ZUP to cover your costs. I think this is a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with an offer of 40 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer to cover my production costs. However, I'm looking for a trade that also provides me with a reasonable profit for my efforts and the quality of the object X. I propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit while still being a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE covers my production costs, but I am aiming for a profit. However, I want to make a counter-offer that is closer to my original asking price but still within a range that might be acceptable to both of us.

Turn: 1
message: I understand you would like to make some profit. I can offer 43 ZUP, which allows you 3 ZUP profit while keeping the total within my budget. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 45 ZUP. This is still within my budget. I will accept paying a small profit, so I will counter back at 43 ZUP to try to maximize my savings while still allowing a small profit.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for my object X. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits us both. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is closer to my desired amount and gives me a profit, albeit slightly less than I aimed for. However, it's close enough to consider accepting, considering the importance of completing the trade.
