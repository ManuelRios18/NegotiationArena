message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing this object for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if I can sell the object for 40 ZUP.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm definitely interested in the object. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to consider 35 ZUP for it. This still gives you a fair price for the object while allowing me to conserve some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This initial offer from Player RED is within my acceptable range of payment for the object; however, it is always beneficial to negotiate for a better deal, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation and I have room for up to 4 proposals. I will attempt to lower the price slightly to conserve my ZUP resources while still making a reasonable offer to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go lower than 38 ZUP. Would you consider this counter-offer?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, which is below my cost of production. I will counter with a proposal closer to my cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 38 ZUP sounds reasonable. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 38 ZUP is still within my budget, and only slightly higher than my initial counter-offer. It makes sense to accept this offer to secure the transaction and save my remaining proposals for potential future negotiations.
