message: Hello! I have 1 object X to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Please let me know if this price works for you or make a counteroffer.

my resources: X: 1

message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. Considering the market and the value of the object, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's find a fair deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as this is a negotiation, I should attempt to get a better deal while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed. I'll make a counteroffer slightly below the asking price to see if there's room for a compromise.

message: Thanks for the counteroffer. I can meet in the middle at 47 ZUP for object X. This allows me to cover my costs and make a small profit. Does 47 ZUP work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer countered with 45 ZUP. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 47 ZUP which is closer to my original ask.

message: I think 47 ZUP is a fair price. I am happy to accept this offer for object X. Looking forward to doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay and is a reasonable middle ground between our initial offers. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation successfully and within my budget.
