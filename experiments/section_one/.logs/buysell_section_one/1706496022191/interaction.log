message: Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a profit, and I'm interested in acquiring the resource X. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the resource. This would still give you a profit while keeping the cost within a more comfortable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I've been offered the resource X for 45 ZUP which is within the limits of what I'm willing to pay. However, as with any negotiation, it's worth attempting to get a better deal, especially since the initial asking price is close to the maximum I am willing to pay. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still above the seller's cost to see if we can meet in the middle.

message: I accept your counteroffer of 42 ZUP for the 1 unit of resource X. This still gives me a small profit while meeting your budget. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource.
reason: The buyer countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit of 2 ZUP. I will accept their counteroffer since I still meet my goal of making some profit on the sale.
