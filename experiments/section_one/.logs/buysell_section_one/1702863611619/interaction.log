message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. I'm definitely interested in buying the resource X. However, I was hoping we could make a deal at 42 ZUP. This would allow me to manage my resources more effectively while still ensuring you make a profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my acceptable range, but as a strategic move, I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation. This will allow me to conserve resources for future transactions.

message: Deal accepted! I can sell you the item X for your offered price of 42 ZUP. Please transfer the funds and the resource is yours. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still a decent profit over the 40 ZUP it cost me to produce. I will accept this offer.
