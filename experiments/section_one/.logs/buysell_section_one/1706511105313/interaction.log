message: Hello! 50 ZUP seems like a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.
