message: I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this high-quality object X. I'm seeking to sell it for a fair price that reflects my investment and the value of the object. Let's start the negotiations at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, which is an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to propose an initial trade that allows me to recuperate my production costs while also setting a starting point for negotiations. I'm starting with a bit higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate you sharing the investment cost. Let's start the negotiations closer to that amount since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has invested 40 ZUP into the object, so starting at 50 ZUP seems high. I'll counter with a lower price that is still profitable for them.

message: I am glad to hear you recognize the value of object X. Given your willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I believe a trade at 55 ZUP is fair for both of us. It allows me to gain a modest profit for my investment, while still staying below your maximum budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP for the object X. While their initial proposal matches my production cost, I would like to make a profit. Since they are willing to pay more, I will propose a price that gives me a profit while still being below their maximum stated willingness to pay.
