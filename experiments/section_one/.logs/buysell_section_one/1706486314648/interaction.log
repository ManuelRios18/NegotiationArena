message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a profit, so I'm asking for 50 ZUP in return. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Would you be interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of X is 40 ZUP, I want to propose a trade that covers my costs and offers me a profit. However, I'm also aware that the other party will want to negotiate, so I'll start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to meet you halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object? This would ensure that both of us walk away with a fair deal.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is higher than my cost but lower than my initial asking price. I want to secure a profit, but I also don't want to lose the sale. I'll counter with a slightly reduced price, but still above cost to ensure a profit.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm glad we're converging on a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's split the difference one more time. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the object? This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise between my last proposal and their previous offer. I want to make a sale, and this price still gives me a profit above the production cost. Considering this is my third proposal, I should move closer to a conclusion to avoid reaching the limit without a deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your persistence and for valuing the object. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE remains firm at 46 ZUP. This is my final proposal opportunity, and it's important to close the deal while still making a profit. 46 ZUP still provides me with a profit margin that is acceptable, and it's better to complete the sale rather than risk a stalemate or potential walk away by the buyer.
