message: Hello! I am selling 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource. I would like to sell it to you for 45 ZUP so I can make a small profit. What do you think?

my resources: X: 1

message: Hello! Thank you for the offer. 50 ZUP is the highest I'm willing to pay and still fits within my budget. Would you accept 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I could counteroffer 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for <ZUP>. It cost X: 40 ZUP to produce
