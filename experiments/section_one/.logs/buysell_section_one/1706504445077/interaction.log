Turn: 0
message: I have a quality resource available that I believe offers great value. How about we start with a proposal of 50 ZUP for my resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for more than it cost to produce (40 ZUP). I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to open negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you starting this negotiation and believe we can find a fair price between us. However, 50 ZUP is more than I planned to pay. Would you consider 40 ZUP for your resource X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's opening offer of 50 ZUP is a bit high compared to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with a lower price to see if we can find common ground between our limits.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP doesn't cover my costs and efforts. Let's meet halfway. How about we settle at 45 ZUP for the resource? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is at my production cost, which wouldn't yield any profit. I'll propose a price in-between my initial ask and their counter-offer to move towards a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, 45 ZUP seems like a fair compromise between both our positions. I accept trading 45 ZUP for your resource X. This is a deal that works for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 45 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept this compromise price since it is within my range.
