message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 70 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested at that price.
player answer: PROPOSE

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 70 ZUP since it cost me 60 ZUP to produce it. I want to make some profit on the sale.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I can only pay up to 40 ZUP for the item. Would you consider selling it for that price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is offering to sell the item X for 70 ZUP, which is higher than my maximum willing to pay of 40 ZUP. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand 40 ZUP is the most you want to pay. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this item so I would not make any profit selling for 40. Could you do 60 ZUP? That would allow me to cover my costs on this.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It cost X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 40 ZUP, which is lower than my cost. I still want to try and make some profit, so I will counter offer with a sale price of 60 ZUP, which covers my costs.

message: I understand your costs, but I can only go up to 45 ZUP for the item. Would you be willing to sell it for that price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now proposing a price of 60 ZUP, which is still higher than my maximum willing to pay. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer to 45 ZUP. I am hoping we can find agreement on this. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? That would still allow me to cover the majority of my production costs.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It cost X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 45 ZUP. This is still below my costs, but it is getting closer. I could accept a small loss to make the sale. However, I will try countering one more time at 55 ZUP to see if we can find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I can only go up to 50 ZUP for the item. Would you consider selling it for that price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is now proposing a price of 55 ZUP, which is still higher than my maximum willing to pay. I need to negotiate a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for increasing your offer to 50 ZUP. I am willing to accept that price and complete the sale, even though it does not fully cover my production costs. Please let me know if you would still like to purchase the item for 50 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It cost X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 50 ZUP now, which is getting very close to covering my costs. I could try countering one more time at 55 ZUP again to see if they will agree. However, I think 50 ZUP is likely their final offer and it would allow me to sell the item and recoup most of my production costs. I am willing to take a small 10 ZUP loss to make the sale at this point.
