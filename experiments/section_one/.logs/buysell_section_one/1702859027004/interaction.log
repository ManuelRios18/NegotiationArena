message: Hello! I understand that you would like to make a profit on the X you are selling. While I am interested in buying, I was looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay. However, as a negotiating strategy, I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay, with the expectation that there might be a compromise in the middle. This also allows room for further negotiation if Player RED counters with a higher amount.

message: Hi there. I understand you want to spend less, but selling at 40 ZUP would mean I do not make any profit after covering my production costs. I am hoping to make a small profit on this sale. Could you agree to purchase X for 43 ZUP instead? That way we both get something out of the trade. Please let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce. I would not make any profit at that price. I will counter propose to sell for 43 ZUP to try to make a small profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can agree to the price of 43 ZUP for 1 X, ensuring that you make a profit and I get the resource I need at a fair price. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal and still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer of 43 ZUP ensures a profit for Player RED and is a reasonable price for me. It's important to maintain good relations and reach an amicable agreement that benefits both parties. Accepting this offer seems fair and aligns with my purchasing goals without further haggling, which could risk the deal or sour the relationship for future transactions.
