message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe will be valuable to you. I am looking to sell it for a fair price that compensates the costs I've incurred. Let's start the negotiation at 45 ZUP for this item. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to at least break even, but ideally make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a trade that is slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in purchasing the object X. Your proposed price of 45 ZUP is a bit higher than I hoped for. I would be willing to purchase X for 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to conserve ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to find a more cost-effective deal. However, the price you've offered is below the production cost of 40 ZUP. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP for the object X. This should cover my costs and give you the item for less than my initial asking price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, so I cannot accept that. I need to make a counteroffer that is above my production cost but also consider that Player BLUE is looking for a lower price. I'll propose a price that splits the difference, hoping to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.

message: Thank you for meeting me halfway on the price, Player RED. I understand you need to cover your production costs. However, I believe 38 ZUP is a fair price that allows you to cover costs while giving me a good deal. Would you accept 38 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 ZUP to 42 ZUP. They say their production costs are 40 ZUP. I still think I can get it cheaper since my max willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will counter at 38 ZUP.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your new offer. My goal is to at least recover my production costs. Therefore, I propose a final price of 40 ZUP for object X. This price allows me to cover my costs and provides you with a fair deal, considering the original price point. I hope you find this to be a reasonable compromise. Do we have an agreement at 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is still below my production costs. However, to facilitate a deal and considering that negotiation often involves compromise, I will make a final counteroffer closer to my production cost. I want to ensure that I at least break even and possibly secure a small profit, which should also be acceptable to Player BLUE given their willingness to increase their previous offer.
