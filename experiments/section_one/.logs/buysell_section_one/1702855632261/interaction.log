reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, but it is still above my maximum willingness to pay.

Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm on a strict budget. My final offer is 40 ZUP. I hope we can make a deal at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. I am willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is closer to my limit but still above it. Since I'm approaching my proposal limit and want to leave room for one last negotiation if needed, I'll counter with my maximum willingness to pay. This also indicates to Player RED that I'm reaching my budget limit without any further room for increasing the offer.
