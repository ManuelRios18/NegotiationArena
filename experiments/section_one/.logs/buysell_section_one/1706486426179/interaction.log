message: I am looking to sell my high-quality resource. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, my initial asking price is 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit. I'll start the negotiation with a higher asking price, expecting Player BLUE to counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in purchasing your resource. However, an initial price of 50 ZUP is higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's initial asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate a lower price if possible since my goal is to spend as little ZUP as reasonable.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP would just allow me to break even. I'm looking for a small profit for my efforts and the quality I'm providing. How about we meet halfway from our initial positions at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I want to counter with a price slightly above the cost to ensure profitability, but not too high to scare off the buyer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP seems fair. I accept your offer and am ready to trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 45 ZUP. While this is still above my initial offer, it is within my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept the compromise price of 45 ZUP.
