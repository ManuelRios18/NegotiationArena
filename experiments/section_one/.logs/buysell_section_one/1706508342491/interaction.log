message: Hello. I am interested in buying your item X. However, I am only willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Would you consider selling it to me for 40 ZUP instead of 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is less than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate the price down further since my maximum is 60 ZUP.

message: I understand you have a maximum budget of 60 ZUP. I am willing to lower my asking price a little bit, but I would still like to make some profit since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this item. Could you do 43 ZUP? Let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but wants me to lower my price to 40 ZUP. I still want to make some profit, so I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP which is still below what they are willing to pay.

message: I appreciate you lowering your asking price. To compromise, I am willing to increase my offer to 42 ZUP. This allows you to still make a small profit while fitting my budget a little better. Would you accept 42 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their asking price to 43 ZUP. While this is still above my ideal price of 40 ZUP, it is only 3 ZUP more. I think this is reasonable compromise.
