message: Hello! I understand that it cost you 40 ZUP to produce the item. I appreciate you wanting to make a profit, but I was hoping we could meet halfway between your cost and your asking price. Would you be willing to sell it for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a lower price if possible to conserve resources while achieving my goal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still within a reasonable range, considering the cost of production mentioned by RED.

message: I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. I would like to make a small profit if possible. Could we compromise at 42 ZUP? That splits the difference between my original ask and your offer. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay 40 ZUP which is my original cost. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 42 ZUP which splits the difference between my ask and their offer.

message: That sounds like a fair compromise. I am happy to accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the item. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a fair compromise and only 2 ZUP above my initial counteroffer. Accepting this offer would allow me to secure the resource while maintaining a good portion of my resources for future use or needs. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
