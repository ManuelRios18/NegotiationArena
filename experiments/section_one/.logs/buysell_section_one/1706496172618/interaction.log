message: Hello! I am selling 1 X resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this resource so I would like to sell it for 50 ZUP to make some profit. Please let me know if you are willing to purchase it for 50 ZUP.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I understand you're looking to make a profit, and while I appreciate your offer, I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This would still provide you with a profit above your production cost and allow us to make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the resource for 50 ZUP which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources while still working towards my goal of acquiring the resource for at most 60 ZUP.

message: I agree to sell the 1 X resource for 45 ZUP. This is a fair deal that provides profit for both of us. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a decent profit over my costs. I will accept this offer.
