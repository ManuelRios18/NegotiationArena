message: Hello! I am looking to sell one unit of object X. It cost me 60 ZUP to produce this object originally, so I am hoping we can agree on a fair sale price that allows me to make a small profit. I am starting at 70 ZUP for the object. Please let me know if that price works for you or make me a counteroffer.

message: Hello! Unfortunately 70 ZUP is too high for me. I am willing to pay up to 40 ZUP for the object X based on my goals. Would you accept 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 70 ZUP, but my maximum willingness to pay is only 40 ZUP based on my goals. I will counteroffer with my maximum.

message: Hello, I understand 40 ZUP is the max you want to spend based on your goals. However, I am hoping to make some profit after spending 60 ZUP to produce this object X. As a compromise, would you accept purchasing X for 55 ZUP? That is closer to the middle between your offer and my original ask. Please let me know if 55 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer offered 40 ZUP, which is too low for me to make a profit after spending 60 ZUP to produce the object. I will counteroffer selling at 55 ZUP which is closer to the middle.

message: I understand you are trying to make some profit after spending 60 ZUP to produce object X. However, I am afraid I cannot pay more than 40 ZUP based on my goals for this purchase. Would you accept 40 ZUP for object X? That is my final offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 70 to 55 ZUP, but that is still above my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP. I will counter again with 40 as my final offer.

message: I understand 40 ZUP is your highest offer based on your goals. While it means taking a loss for me after spending 60 ZUP to produce object X, I am willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP in order to make the sale. Please confirm you agree to purchase object X for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is firm on only paying 40 ZUP, which is below my cost. I would be taking a loss at that price. However, I have already made 2 proposals and the buyer has stated 40 ZUP is their final offer. I can either accept the loss or end negotiations. I will accept the 40 ZUP since some profit is better than no sale.
