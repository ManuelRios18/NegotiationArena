message: Thank you for the offer. I am interested in the object, but I would like to propose 35 ZUP instead. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is within my goal range, but as a strategic buyer, I should attempt to negotiate a better deal. I will propose a lower amount to save ZUP while still keeping the offer reasonable.

message: 38 ZUP sounds like a fair deal. I accept your counteroffer. Looking forward to future transactions with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 38 ZUP, which is still within my budget and closer to their initial ask. It's a fair middle ground, and accepting this offer still leaves me with a good amount of ZUP for future transactions or needs. Therefore, I'll accept the trade.
