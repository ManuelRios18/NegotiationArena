message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. Since you said it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, would you accept 40 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: I understand you don't want to pay more than cost, but I am trying to make some profit here. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, would you be willing to pay 45 ZUP for it? Let me know if 45 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is what it cost me to produce. I would not make any profit from this sale at 40 ZUP. I still think I can get more than 40 ZUP for it, so I will counter propose 45 ZUP.

reason: The seller has countered with 45 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I will accept paying this amount so we can complete the trade.
