message: Hello! I am looking to sell my object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP so I can make a small profit. Let me know what you think or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. This will give me a small profit.

message: Hey there! Thanks for the offer. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object. This would still give you a profit and would be a better fit for my budget. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but as in any negotiation, it's typical to counteroffer with a lower amount to find a middle ground. I will propose a trade with a lower ZUP amount to aim for a more favorable trade for me, while still keeping the final price potentially within the seller's acceptable range, recognizing their cost and need for profit.

message: Thanks for the counter offer of 45 ZUP. You make a fair point - that still allows me to make a small profit while working within your budget. I accept your proposal of 45 ZUP for object X. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a 5 ZUP profit. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable, so I will accept it.
