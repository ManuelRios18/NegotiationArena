message: Hello! I am looking to sell this object X that I have. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I am hoping to sell it for at least that much plus some profit. I am proposing to sell it to you for 50 ZUP. Let me know if that works for you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the object X for 50 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make some profit.

message: Hi there! I appreciate your offer. I understand the need for profit, but I'm also looking to get a good deal here. Would you consider selling it for 45 ZUP? This price would still provide you with a profit over your production cost. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP, the initial offer of 50 ZUP by Player RED is within my budget. However, it is always beneficial in negotiations to attempt to secure a better deal if possible, without offending the other party or causing them to withdraw the offer. I will propose a slightly lower price, aiming for a middle ground that is still above their cost of production, to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: Thanks for the counter offer. 45 ZUP would still allow me to make a small profit so I am happy to accept selling the object X for 45 ZUP. Please let me know if you agree and we can complete the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 45 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this is still 5 ZUP over what it cost me to produce so I would still make some profit. I think 45 ZUP is reasonable so I will accept.
