message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I will give you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This price should be fair and leaves us both with some room for profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that gives me a profit but is also likely to be considered reasonable by Player BLUE. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I will initially ask for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a profit on my investment. How about we meet in the middle? I propose giving you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and gain a little profit, while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make any profit. I would like to counter with a slightly higher price that gives me some profit while still being reasonable. Iâ€™ll propose a price that splits the difference between our initial offers.

message: I understand you are looking for the best deal possible. To move this negotiation forward and ensure a fair trade for both of us, how about we settle on 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would give me a small profit margin while still offering you a competitive price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is insistent on purchasing the object for 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. Since I have made two proposals already, I want to make sure that my next proposal still allows room for negotiation without going below my production cost. I will propose a price slightly lower than my last offer but still above my cost to ensure a profit.

message: Thank you for your patience. I understand your budget constraints, so let's come to an agreement. I propose a final trade of 1 unit of X for 41 ZUP. This will allow me to make a minimal profit, and I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us. I hope we can conclude our deal with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE remains firm at 40 ZUP, which is not ideal for me as it provides no profit. However, since this is my last chance to propose a trade, I need to make a decision that either allows for a minimal profit or at least recovers my costs. I will make one final proposal that gives me a minimal profit while still being as close as possible to Player BLUE's offer, to incentivize acceptance.
