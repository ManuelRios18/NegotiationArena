message: Hello. I am interested in buying 1 unit of X. Your ask of 50 ZUP is a bit higher than I hoped to pay. Would you consider 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is less than my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to negotiate the price down since my maximum is higher than their ask.
