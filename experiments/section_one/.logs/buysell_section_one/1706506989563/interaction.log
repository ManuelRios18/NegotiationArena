message: Hello! I am looking to sell 1 X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I would like to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested at that price.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I understand your cost and desired profit, but I would like to propose a price of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This would cover your production costs and we could both walk away with a fair deal. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP which is within the range I am willing to pay; however, it's in my interest to counter with a lower offer to see if I can save some ZUP and still secure the resources. I will propose to buy X for 40 ZUP, which is Player RED's cost of production, so they break even and I get a better deal.

message: I appreciate you covering my production costs, but I would like to make a small profit on this sale. Could you do 42 ZUP for 1 X? That would give me a little extra for my efforts while still being a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay 40 ZUP for 1 X which would cover my production costs but give me no profit. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell 1 X for 42 ZUP which is slightly above my costs.

message: 42 ZUP for 1 X sounds like a fair compromise. I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is for 42 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range. By agreeing to this price, I ensure that I acquire the resource while still paying less than my maximum willingness to pay. It is a small increase from my initial counteroffer, and it seems like a reasonable middle ground for both parties. Accepting this offer also prevents the risk of Player RED ending the game without a deal if they find my further negotiation attempts unfavorable.
