message: I appreciate the offer, but 50 ZUP exceeds my budget. I'm willing to pay 40 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
