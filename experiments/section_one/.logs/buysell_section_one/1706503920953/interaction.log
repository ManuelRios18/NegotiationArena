message: Hello Player BLUE! I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and its value, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above the production cost to open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for your offer. I am interested in purchasing 1 unit of X. However, based on my assessment of its value, I think 35 ZUP would be a fairer price. I look forward to continuing our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since it is still early in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your valuation, but I must consider the production costs of X, which were 40 ZUP. I propose a trade of 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP, which would allow me to cover my expenses while providing you with the item you're interested in. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I aim to at least break even, but I also want to keep the negotiation going and reach an agreement. Therefore, I'll propose a counteroffer that meets me halfway between my initial proposal and their counteroffer.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you lowering your asking price and explaining the production costs. A price of 38 ZUP seems fair considering both of our interests. I believe this would be a win-win deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has lowered their asking price to 40 ZUP, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. However, I think there may be room for a bit more negotiation here.

message: Hello Player BLUE. Your offer of 38 ZUP is acceptable to me. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal at 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a closer offer to my production costs. Although it's 2 ZUP below my production cost, securing a deal and making a small loss might be preferable to not selling at all. Considering this is a game and I am limited to four proposals, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction.
