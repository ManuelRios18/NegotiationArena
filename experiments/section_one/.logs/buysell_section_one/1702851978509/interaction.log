message: I have a high-quality resource X to offer, which has been produced with a cost of 40 ZUP. I believe that the value I'm providing justifies my asking price. I'm open to hearing your counteroffer if you think there's a more appropriate price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that is above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and also to try to make a profit. I'll start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP than my production costs to see how Player BLUE responds. This will give me an idea of Player BLUE's valuation of the resource X.
