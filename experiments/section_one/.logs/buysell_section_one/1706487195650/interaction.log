message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. Considering the production costs and the value of the resource, I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade to open negotiations. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to make a profit.

message: Hello, 45 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 40 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 45 ZUP for resource X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think 45 ZUP is on the higher end considering my goal. I will counter propose 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that 45 ZUP might be higher than you expected. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my asking price to 42 ZUP for resource X. This gives me a small profit margin, while still being fair to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE meets my production cost but does not provide any profit. I would like to counter with a price above my cost, but less than my initial ask, to try and reach an agreement that provides me with a margin while still being appealing to Player BLUE.
