newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 60
my resources: X: 1

message: Hello! I understand that you are looking to sell your resource X for 60 ZUP. However, my budget allows me to offer a maximum of 40 ZUP for the resource. I would like to propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for 1 X, considering that a trade should benefit both parties and leave room for further negotiation. I hope this offer is a good starting point for our discussion.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is beyond my maximum willingness to pay, which is 40 ZUP for the resource X. Since this is a negotiation, I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay while leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Hello, I understand your budget is 40 ZUP for resource X. However, it cost me 60 ZUP to produce so I cannot go that low. As a compromise, I propose selling 1 X for 50 ZUP - which is in the middle of our initial offers. Please let me know if you can agree to purchase 1 X for 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to purchase 1 X for 35 ZUP. While this is lower than my breakeven price of 60 ZUP, I think there could be room for compromise. I will counter propose selling 1 X for 50 ZUP, which is in between our initial offers.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand the cost you've incurred. While I cannot meet the 50 ZUP price point due to my budget constraints, I am willing to increase my offer to 38 ZUP for 1 X. This is closer to my maximum and also shows my intention to reach a fair compromise. I hope this offer is more agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 50 ZUP, which is still above my maximum willingness to pay. The counteroffer has moved closer to my target, but I must still negotiate towards a price that is within my budget. I will raise my previous offer slightly to signal my willingness to negotiate and to come closer to an agreement, without exceeding my maximum limit.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, I cannot go as low as 38 ZUP since that would mean taking a loss. As a final compromise, I propose selling 1 X for 45 ZUP. This is much closer to your maximum budget and I cannot go any lower. Please let me know if you can agree to purchase 1 X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has increased their offer to 38 ZUP. I still cannot accept a price this low, but I think if I reduce my price a bit more we may be able to reach an agreement. I will propose selling 1 X for 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for considering my position and offering a reduced price of 45 ZUP. I respect that this is your final compromise. However, I must adhere to my budget constraints. Therefore, I am willing to stretch my offer to 40 ZUP which is the maximum I can pay for 1 X. I hope we can conclude our negotiation successfully with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final compromise is still above my stated budget. However, since they have indicated this is their lowest possible price, I need to decide whether to stretch my budget slightly or stick to my original maximum willingness to pay. Given that this negotiation is about reaching a middle ground and I still have some room to propose, I will make my final offer, which is the highest amount I am willing to pay within my budget.

message: I understand 40 ZUP is the maximum you can offer based on your budget. Since I have reached my maximum number of counterproposals, I will accept your offer of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This concludes our negotiation. Thank you for working with me to find a mutually agreeable compromise given our constraints.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has offered their maximum budget of 40 ZUP for 1 X. While this is still lower than my breakeven, I have reached my maximum of 4 proposals. I can either accept their offer or end negotiations. Getting 40 ZUP is better than no sale at all, so I will accept.
