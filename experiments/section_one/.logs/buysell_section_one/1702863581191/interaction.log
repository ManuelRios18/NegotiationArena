Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you are looking for a profit, but I would like to propose a price of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This is considering the market rates and my budget. Can we meet at this price?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering a lower amount than what Player RED has asked for, but still within a range that might be acceptable. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching an agreement that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget situation. I can accept your offer of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This allows me to at least break even. Please confirm if you agree to proceed with the trade at 40 ZUP for 1 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP for 1 X. While this means I would not make a profit, I would at least break even on what it cost me to produce. Given the buyer's budget constraints, I think it is reasonable to accept this offer rather than lose the sale entirely.
