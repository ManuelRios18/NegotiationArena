message: I've got a high-quality object that I believe is worth more than its production cost due to its rarity and demand. I propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for the object. Let's negotiate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to recover at least my production cost, so I will start with a higher offer to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in purchasing the object. However, 50 ZUP is higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you consider 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter with 45 ZUP to see if I can get it for cheaper.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand that you're looking to purchase at a reasonable price. How about we meet halfway between our initial proposals? I propose 47 ZUP for the object. This price reflects its value while still being fair to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, which is good. However, I would like to see if I can get a slightly higher amount to optimize profit. I will propose a price in the middle as a compromise.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to purchase the object for 47 ZUP. That is a fair price we both can accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller countered with 47 ZUP, which is very close to my maximum willingness to pay. I will accept this price since it is still within my range.
