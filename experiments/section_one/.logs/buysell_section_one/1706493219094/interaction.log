message: Hello! I'm selling 1 unit of item X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce so I'd like to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you're interested at that price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: Thank you for the offer. I understand that you want to make a profit, but I would like to propose a price of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of item X. This covers your costs and is within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has asked for, in order to potentially reach a middle ground that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. Offering 40 ZUP makes sense as it covers Player RED's cost and still leaves room for negotiation.

message: I understand you want to stay within your budget. I would still like to make a small profit if possible. Could we meet in the middle at 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X? That should work for both of our needs. Please let me know.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP, which covers my costs but doesn't allow me to make any profit. I would like to make at least a small profit, so I will counter propose selling for 43 ZUP which is in between my original ask and their offer.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Meeting in the middle sounds fair. How about we settle at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of item X? I believe this offer is beneficial to both of us while still allowing you to make a profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price slightly, which is a good sign. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a better price. By proposing 42 ZUP, I am moving up slightly from my original offer and showing willingness to compromise, yet still staying well within my maximum limit.

message: 42 ZUP is agreeable to me. Thank you for negotiating to a price that allows me to cover my costs and make a bit of profit. Let's complete the trade for 1 unit of X at 42 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has come up to 42 ZUP, which is still a small profit for me. I think this is a reasonable deal that meets both our interests, so I will accept it.
