message: Hello! I am looking to sell 1 unit of item X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce this item, so I am hoping to sell it for 45 ZUP to make a small profit. Please let me know if you are interested in buying at this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

message: I understand that you want to make a profit on your item. I'm interested in buying, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of item X. This would still give you a profit above your production cost, and it would be a more favorable deal for me. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is at 45 ZUP for 1 unit of item X, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, as a buyer, it is in my best interest to negotiate for a better price if possible. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 45 ZUP but still gives the seller a profit above their cost.

message: I appreciate you coming up in price. I am hoping to get 44 ZUP for the 1 unit of X. This allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal. Please let me know if 44 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While this is still profitable for me, I would like to try to get a little closer to my original ask. I will counter back at 44 ZUP.

message: Thanks for considering my offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between our last two proposals? I propose 43 ZUP for the unit of X. It's a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think about this compromise?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 44 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer but still above it. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and we are in the negotiation phase, I will make a second counteroffer that splits the difference between my first offer and the seller's counteroffer. This should be appealing to both parties as it still provides a profit for the seller and keeps the cost within my acceptable range.

message: I agree to meet in the middle at your proposed 43 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please confirm that you accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered again at 43 ZUP, which is in between our last two proposals. I said I could go down to 44 ZUP, so I will accept their offer of meeting in the middle at 43 ZUP.
