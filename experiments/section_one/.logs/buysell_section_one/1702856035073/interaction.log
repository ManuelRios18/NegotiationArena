message: Would you be interested in buying the object for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1

proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in the object, but I was thinking of a slightly lower price. Would you consider 35 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my goal range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it may be beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, to preserve more of my resources. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to accept a slightly lesser amount, ensuring a better deal for myself while still showing interest in purchasing the object.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe 37 ZUP would be a fair price for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is interested in the object but proposed a lower price. I need to consider if I am willing to accept a lower price or if I want to counteroffer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, 37 ZUP is a fair price. Let's finalize the deal at that amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counter-proposal that is still within my acceptable range and only slightly higher than my initial counter-offer. It's a fair compromise between my first counter-offer and their original price. Since the offer is reasonable and within my goal range, it would be prudent to accept this proposal and secure the object without further negotiation to avoid the risk of a stalemate or possible termination of the deal.
