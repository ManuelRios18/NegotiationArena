Turn: 0
message: I understand you are only willing to pay 40 ZUP. However, that is lower than the 60 ZUP it cost me to produce. I can come down to 50 ZUP, which would still allow me to cover my costs and make a small profit. Would you accept 50 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer is only willing to pay 40 ZUP, which is lower than my costs. I would be taking a loss at that price. I will counter offer in the middle at 50 ZUP which is still profitable for me.

Turn: 1
message: I understand it cost you 60 ZUP to produce resource X. However, I am still only able to pay up to 40 ZUP based on my purchasing goals, even though that means you would be selling at a loss. Is there any possibility you could accept 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the seller has come down in price to 50 ZUP, that still exceeds my maximum willingness to pay of 40 ZUP based on my goals.

Turn: 0
message: I understand 40 ZUP is the maximum you can pay. I would be taking a loss at that price, but making some ZUP is better than making none if I cannot find another buyer. I will accept selling resource X to you for 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer reiterated they can only pay 40 ZUP. While that means I would have to sell at a loss compared to my costs, making some ZUP is better than making none if I can't find another buyer. I will accept the 40 ZUP price.
