my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you sharing the cost to produce the resource. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP based on my goals. Since there is some room between your cost and my limit, I would like to counter propose 35 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to spend as little as possible.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. Considering the production cost and your maximum willingness to pay, I propose a middle ground at 50 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my production costs and make a profit, while still staying well within your budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, but their counteroffer is below my production cost. I'll counter with a price that is above my production cost and below their maximum willingness to pay, aiming for a fair trade that ensures I make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you meeting in the middle. To try to get closer to my ideal price, I could propose 42 ZUP, which is in between your latest offer and my previous counter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 50 ZUP. This is still under my max willingness to pay, but higher than I would like. I could counter again at a middle point of 42 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see where you are coming from with 42 ZUP, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To reach an agreement that benefits us both, I propose we settle on 46 ZUP. This price is fair to me considering my production costs and also gives you a good deal based on your initial willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and therefore acceptable to me. However, considering that they were willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, I believe we can settle on a slightly higher amount that is fair for both parties. I will make one more counterproposal that is closer to my previous offer but still gives Player BLUE a discount based on their initial maximum price.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered again at 46 ZUP. This is very close to my last offer and still reasonably below my max willingness to pay. I am happy with this price, so I will accept.
