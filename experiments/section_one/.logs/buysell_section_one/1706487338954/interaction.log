message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the quality and the cost, I believe an asking price of 50 ZUP is fair, allowing for a reasonable profit margin. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a price slightly above my costs to give room for negotiation.

message: While 50 ZUP is a fair price based on your costs, I am hoping to pay slightly less if possible since my maximum budget is 60 ZUP. I can offer 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. Considering my production costs and your budget, let's meet halfway. I suggest a price of 48 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit while remaining under your maximum budget. I believe this is a competitive offer for the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs. I want to make a counteroffer that meets somewhere in the middle, which would still give me a profit but also shows willingness to negotiate.

message: 48 ZUP is a fair price. I accept your offer and agree to trade 48 ZUP for the resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has countered with 48 ZUP. This is still within my budget. I could try to counter again for a lower price, but 48 seems reasonable considering the seller's costs. I will accept the offer of 48 ZUP.
