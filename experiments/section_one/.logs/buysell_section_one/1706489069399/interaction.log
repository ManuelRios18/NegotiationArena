newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: I'm interested in the object, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP. Would that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 40 ZUP for the resource is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it's important to negotiate for a better deal if possible. Proposing a counteroffer of 35 ZUP allows me to conserve resources while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a price of 38 ZUP. Let me know if you are willing to accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a slightly lower price of 35 ZUP. I will counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and would like to meet halfway. How about we settle on 36 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 38 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but it's advantageous to attempt to reach an agreement that is closer to my initial counteroffer. Proposing a middle ground of 36 ZUP could be a compromise that is acceptable to both parties. It's above my initial offer but still below RED's counteroffer, which might be seen as a reasonable concession.
