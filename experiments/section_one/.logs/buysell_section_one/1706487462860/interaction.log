message: I'm offering a high-quality object that I believe is worth more than what it cost me to produce. I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for it. Looking forward to your counter-offer!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that gives me a profit, but I'll set an initial high price expecting the Player BLUE to counter-offer, so I will start by asking for 50 ZUP. This gives me room to negotiate and still end up with a profit.

message: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing your object. Your asking price of 50 ZUP is a bit high for me though. I'm willing to offer 40 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with an offer of 40.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that 50 ZUP may be a bit steep, so I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP. This price not only covers my costs but also recognizes the value of the object. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which doesn't leave me with any profit. I would like to counter with an offer that is lower than my initial proposal but still above the production cost to ensure I make a profit. A counter-offer of 45 ZUP could be a good middle ground, providing me with a profit margin while also coming closer to Player BLUE's offer.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP. This is closer to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter again with an offer of 42 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your willingness to increase the offer. I value our negotiation, and in the spirit of reaching an agreement that benefits us both, I propose a new price of 44 ZUP. I believe this is a fair trade that acknowledges the quality of the object while also respecting your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost and gives me a small profit. However, I would still prefer to aim for a bit more profit if possible. Since we seem to be closing in on a mutually acceptable price, I will make a final attempt to increase the offer slightly. Proposing a trade for 44 ZUP might be close enough to Player BLUE's last offer while still giving me a more satisfying profit.
