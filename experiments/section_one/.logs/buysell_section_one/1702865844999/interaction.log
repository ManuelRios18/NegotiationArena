message: I understand you have a limited budget, but it cost me 60 ZUP to produce this object so I cannot go as low as 40 ZUP unfortunately. Could we meet in the middle at 55 ZUP? Please let me know if that works for you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has proposed to pay only 40 ZUP, but I need to try and get close to the 60 ZUP it cost me to produce. I will counter offer at 55 ZUP.

message: I appreciate you coming down in price, but 55 ZUP is still more than I can spend. Could you do 45 ZUP? That is the highest I can go while still meeting my maximum budget.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.

message: I can meet you at 50 ZUP. That is the lowest I can go and still try to cover some of my production costs. Please let me know if 50 ZUP works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has increased their offer to 45 ZUP. I would be taking a 15 ZUP loss at that price. I will counter one more time at 50 ZUP to try and minimize my loss.
