message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, 40 ZUP is below my production cost of 60 ZUP. I would not be able to sell at that price without incurring a loss. To move towards a compromise, I can lower my initial ask to 65 ZUP. This still covers my costs and gives us some room to finalize a deal that benefits us both. I hope this is closer to something you can work with.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP is below my production cost, so accepting it would result in a loss. It is necessary to counter with an offer that at least allows me to break even. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to leave room for further negotiation but also to signal that I cannot accept a price that doesn't cover my expenses.

message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player BLUE. I understand we have to work within certain constraints, and I'm trying to accommodate your budget while also covering my costs. My production cost is 60 ZUP, and I propose 62 ZUP for the object. This allows me to cover my costs and provides a minimal profit, making it a fair deal for both of us. I hope this adjusted price is more agreeable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 62
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer of 45 ZUP is still below my production cost, so it is not acceptable. However, I recognize the need for further compromise to facilitate a deal. To move the negotiation along, I'll propose a price that covers my production costs and provides a minimal profit margin. I want to propose a price that is closer to my break-even point but still allows for a slight profit to justify the sale.

message: Thank you for your final offer, Player BLUE. I have considered your position and in a spirit of compromise, I am willing to match my production cost. I propose 60 ZUP for object X. This is my lowest price, just covering the production cost without any profit. I hope we can conclude our negotiation successfully with this offer.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal opportunity, and Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production cost. While I need to cover my costs, it is important to consider the possibility that not selling at all could be worse than selling at a slight loss. I will propose a price that just covers my production costs, as this is the lowest I can go without taking a loss on my investment. This is my final proposal, and I hope Player BLUE can meet me here.
