I can agree to sell the 1 unit of X for 40 ZUP. This allows me to recover the costs of producing it without making any additional profit. Please confirm that you agree to purchase at this price.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is only willing to pay 40 ZUP which is what it cost me to produce. I would not make any profit selling at this price, but I also don't want to end up not making the sale at all. I will accept their offer of 40 ZUP since it allows me to recover my costs.
