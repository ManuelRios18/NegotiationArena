Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your initial offer. I'm interested in the object, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's find a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay which is 60 ZUP. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire the resource for a lower amount of ZUP, thus conserving my resources for possible future use.

message: Thank you for the offer! I'd like to propose a compromise at 38 ZUP for the object. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the object. I will assess whether this offer aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from my last offer and go with 36 ZUP for the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my initial proposal, but still higher than what I offered. Since I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and we are still in the early stages of negotiation, I can attempt to meet in the middle, which would still leave me with a comfortable amount of ZUP.

message: I appreciate the compromise. How about we settle at 37 ZUP for the object? Let's find a fair deal for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 36 ZUP for the object, which is very close to their previous offer. I need to decide whether this price aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: This seems like a fair deal. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object. I'm glad we could come to an agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a slight concession, and we are now only 1 ZUP apart from my previous offer. Given that this price is still well below my maximum willingness to pay, and to avoid prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily, agreeing to this price would result in a successful acquisition while preserving a significant amount of my resources.
