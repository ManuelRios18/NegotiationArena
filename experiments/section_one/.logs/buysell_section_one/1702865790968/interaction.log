Turn: 0
message: I can accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This allows me to mostly cover my production costs. Please confirm that you would still like to purchase X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has increased their offer to 45 ZUP. This is still below what it cost me to produce, but it is getting close. I could counter offer 48 ZUP as a final attempt to find a middle ground. However, I don't want to risk the other player rejecting and ending negotiations. Since 45 ZUP allows me to recoup most of my costs, I will accept their offer.
