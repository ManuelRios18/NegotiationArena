message: I have a high-quality object X that I am looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe it's worth more than that. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price reflects both the quality of the object and the effort put into its creation. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate you sharing the costs to produce the object. However, the maximum I'm able to pay is 60 ZUP. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller wants 50 ZUP but my maximum is 60 ZUP. I think 45 ZUP is a fair price considering the seller's costs and my budget.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer and for considering the value of object X. I understand your budget constraints but would like to propose a trade at 48 ZUP. This price allows me to cover my production costs and ensures that you are getting the object at a fair price, considering your maximum willingness to pay. I hope this is an acceptable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but above my production cost. Since Player BLUE is willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, there is still room for negotiation. I will propose a slightly higher amount to reach a fair middle ground that benefits both of us.
