message: Hi, I understand you are hoping to pay 40 ZUP but unfortunately that is how much it cost me to produce this object X so I would not make any profit at that price. I am hoping to make a little profit on this sale. Would you be willing to pay 45 ZUP? Please let me know, thanks!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player proposed 40 ZUP for the object X. However, since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would not make any profit at that price. I will counter propose selling it for 45 ZUP to try to make some profit.

message: 45 ZUP works for me. I can pay that price so you can make a small profit on the sale. Let's complete the trade at 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
