message: Hello! Thank you for your proposal. I understand you want to make a profit on your item. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 42 ZUP for the item. This should still give you a slight profit and make the trade more favorable for me. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer from Player RED is 45 ZUP for 1 unit of item X. This is within the range of what I am willing to pay, which is up to 60 ZUP. However, it's beneficial to negotiate for a lower price to conserve ZUP for future transactions or needs. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower but still within a range that may be acceptable to the seller, considering they stated it cost them 40 ZUP to produce the item.

reason: The buyer has countered with 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked for, this still gives me a small profit over my costs. I will accept their counteroffer.
