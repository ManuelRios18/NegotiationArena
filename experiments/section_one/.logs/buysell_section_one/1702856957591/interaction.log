message: Hi there. I am interested in purchasing the object, but was hoping we could agree on 35 ZUP instead of 45 since that better fits my budget. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 45 ZUP for the object, which is under my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since I have room in my budget.

message: I understand your budget, but I need to cover my production cost of 40 ZUP. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for the object?

message: I understand you need to cover your costs. As a compromise, could we meet in the middle at 37 ZUP? I'm trying to save a bit on my end as well.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
