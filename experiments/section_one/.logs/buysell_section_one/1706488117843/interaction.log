message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and offers a fair margin for the value of the resource. I'm looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have only one X to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation and ensure I can cover my costs and make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe 40 ZUP would be a fairer price that works for both of us. This still allows you to cover your costs while providing me better value. Please let me know if you can accept 40 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think there may be room to negotiate a lower price that is mutually beneficial.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your desire for a better deal, I need to ensure I also make a profit. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for 1 X, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that only covers my production costs, not allowing for any profit. Since negotiation is expected, I'll counter with a price above their offer but lower than my initial proposal to find a middle ground that allows me to make a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, I agree to purchase 1 X for 45 ZUP. This allows us both to make a fair deal. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from their original ask of 50 ZUP. Their new offer of 45 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay. I could try to negotiate further, but 45 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise.
