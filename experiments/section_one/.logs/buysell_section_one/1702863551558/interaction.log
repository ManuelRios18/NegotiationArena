message: Hello! Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a profit, but I'm also trying to manage my resources efficiently. Would you consider selling the item for 42 ZUP? This still gives you a profit over the production cost and allows me to save some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it would be in my interest to negotiate for a better price if possible to conserve resources. I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to RED's cost to see if there's room for negotiation.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP. This is still a profit for me and allows you to conserve some resources. Please confirm you would like to purchase item X for 42 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has counter offered 42 ZUP. While less than I originally asked, this still gives me a small profit over my costs. I think this is a reasonable offer that I should accept.
