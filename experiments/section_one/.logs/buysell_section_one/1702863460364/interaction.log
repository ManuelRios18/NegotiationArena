message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you want to sell your object X for slightly below your costs. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 30 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 35 ZUP, which is a fair starting point considering they mentioned that their cost of production is 40 ZUP. However, my goal is to obtain the resource for at most 60 ZUP, and it's beneficial to negotiate to get a better deal, closer to my ideal price range. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to counter back at 35 ZUP to try to cover more of my costs. I believe 35 ZUP is a fair price that works for both of us. Please let me know if you can agree to this price.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has countered with 30 ZUP. I still want to try to recover most of my production costs, so I will counter back with an offer in the middle.

message: I understand your concern about covering your costs. Meeting halfway between our offers, I can increase my offer to 32 ZUP. I hope this can be a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reiterated their initial offer of 35 ZUP, which they believe covers more of their production costs. Considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the offer is well within my range and seems quite reasonable. However, since this is a negotiation and I want to ensure I get the best possible deal, I will propose a middle ground between my first offer and Player RED's offer.
