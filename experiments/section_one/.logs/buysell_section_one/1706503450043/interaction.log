message: I'm offering object X, which has been valued at 40 ZUP due to production costs. I believe it has additional value due to its uniqueness and propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Please let me know your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your valuation.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for a profit. I need to recoup at least 40 ZUP because that's what it cost to produce the resource. To start the negotiation, I will propose a trade where I ask for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller valued the object at 40 ZUP due to production costs, but is trying to sell it for 50 ZUP. My maximum is 60 ZUP, so I have some room to negotiate. I will counter with an offer closer to my maximum.

message: I'm pleased we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 55 ZUP for object X. Thank you for the smooth negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 55 ZUP, which is above my production cost and initial asking price. Accepting this offer would result in a profit, and it is a fair valuation. It is in my best interest to accept this proposal and not risk further negotiations that could potentially reduce the offer.
