message: Hello, 45 ZUP is a bit low for me. I am willing to pay 50 ZUP for the resource. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller proposed 45 ZUP which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since it leaves room for the seller to counter and is still below my max.
