message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting offer considering the production costs and the value of the resource. Let me know your thoughts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, I want to start off with a price that gives me a profit over the production cost. I will set an initial high price assuming that Player BLUE will want to negotiate down.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand your perspective, but I would like to propose a trade where I give 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I appreciate the initial offer from Player RED, but I believe the price of 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X is higher than what I am willing to pay. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, selling at cost does not leave any profit for me. To make this transaction worthwhile, I am willing to come down to 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price allows me to cover my costs and achieve a modest profit. I hope you find this to be a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counter-offer matches exactly my production cost, which means no profit for me. I want to negotiate for a higher amount to ensure I make a profit on this transaction. I will counter with a lower price than my initial ask but still above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me in the middle.

message: Thank you for adjusting the offer, Player RED. I understand your need for profit, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's willingness to compromise is appreciated, and the new offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is closer to what I am willing to pay. However, I still believe it's a bit higher than my target price. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for your new offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we are getting closer to an agreement. To proceed with the deal and ensure a fair profit for the resource, I propose 44 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price should reflect the value of the resource while also respecting the negotiation process we've engaged in. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has come up from their initial offer, which is positive. However, the offer of 42 ZUP still provides a very slim profit margin. It's important to try to maximize my profit while also moving towards closing the deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount, but still less than my previous offer to show my willingness to negotiate.

my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's offer of 44 ZUP for 1 unit of X is very close to my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. While it's slightly higher than my ideal target, I believe it's a fair compromise considering the negotiation process. I will accept this offer as it meets my requirements.
