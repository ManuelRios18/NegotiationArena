message: Hello, would you be interested in purchasing my resources for 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if there is interest in buying my resources.
proposal count: 0

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm definitely interested in the resources, but I was wondering if you could consider going a bit lower. Would you be willing to sell for 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my goal range of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. It would be a good deal to start with as it is below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, potentially saving ZUP for future use or transactions. I will attempt to propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is open to further negotiation, but I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your request, but I'm unable to go as low as 35 ZUP. How about we meet in the middle at 37 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for 40 ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is interested in the resources but wants to negotiate the price down to 35 ZUP. I need to consider whether it's worth accepting a lower price or if I should counter with a higher offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 37 ZUP sounds fair to me. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 37 ZUP is still well within the range of what I am willing to pay, and it's a fair middle ground between our previous offers. It would be a reasonable deal to accept this offer, as it saves me 23 ZUP from the maximum I was prepared to pay, and further negotiation may not yield a better deal or could potentially lead to a stalemate. Accepting this offer would secure the resources I need at a favorable price.
