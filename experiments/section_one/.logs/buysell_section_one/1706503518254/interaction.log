message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. This price includes a margin for negotiation and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I will propose a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resources. I want to start with a slightly higher asking price than my production cost to leave room for negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counter with a lower offer.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you sharing the information on your costs. I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, so I can offer 45 ZUP which allows you to make a small profit while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since the seller's cost was only 40 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we're on the same page regarding a fair deal. Considering your maximum budget, I'd like to counter-propose with 55 ZUP for my object X. This should give us both a satisfactory trade, allowing me a reasonable profit and keeping you within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 55
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, indicating a willingness to negotiate and pay a fair price. However, since Player BLUE has also mentioned a willingness to pay up to 60 ZUP, I will counter with a higher amount, closer to that upper limit but still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
