message: Thank you for the offer. I am interested, but I would like to counter with a price of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay for the resource, but as a negotiation tactic, I will try to get a better deal by proposing a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for further negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.
