message: Hello. I am interested in buying the object X from you. However, the asking price of 45 ZUP is slightly over my ideal budget. Would you consider selling it to me for 35 ZUP instead? This would allow me to save on costs while still allowing you to make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

Hello again. I understand you are hoping to get the best price. However, it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this object X, so I cannot sell it at a loss. The lowest price I could accept is 40 ZUP to cover my production costs. Would you be willing to purchase X for 40 ZUP? Let me know.

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer has proposed to purchase X for 35 ZUP. While this would allow me to make a very small profit, I was hoping to make a profit of at least 5 ZUP to make the sale worthwhile. I will counter propose selling for 40 ZUP, which is my break even point.
