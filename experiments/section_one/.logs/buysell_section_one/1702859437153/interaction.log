message: Hi! I'm interested in buying the resource X. I understand you want to make a profit, but I have to consider my budget as well. Would you consider selling it for 40 ZUP? This would still cover your costs and allow us to make a fair deal.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.

message: I understand you have a budget to consider. I would still like to make a small profit if possible. Could we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give me a little profit while still being within your budget. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed to pay 40 ZUP which would cover my costs but not give me any profit. I would like to make some profit, so I will counter propose to sell for 42 ZUP which is in between my original ask and their offer.

message: Meeting in the middle at 42 ZUP sounds fair to me. This allows you to make a profit, and it's within my budget. I'm happy to go ahead with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is closer to my upper limit. Since I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, accepting 42 ZUP is a good deal for me. It also meets the seller's need to make a profit while staying within my budget.
