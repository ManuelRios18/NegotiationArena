message: Thanks for considering my counteroffer. Meeting halfway at 41 ZUP would work better for my budget. Does that sound fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down on the price, which is a good sign. The counteroffer is still within my maximum willingness to pay. I will try to negotiate a slightly better deal that is closer to my initial offer while leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
