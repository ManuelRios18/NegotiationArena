message: I understand that 80 ZUP may be too high for you. Let's find a middle ground. How about 70 ZUP for the object X? This price still covers my production costs and gives me a modest profit, and hopefully, it's more in line with your budget.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the other player cannot pay 80 ZUP, I need to lower my asking price to entice a sale but still aim to cover my costs and make a profit. It's also strategic to not drop to my lowest acceptable price immediately to maintain negotiation leverage.
