message: 
Hello! I am looking to sell my 1 unit of resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce it originally, so I am hoping to sell it for a slight profit. Does selling it to you for 45 ZUP seem fair? 

player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will start by proposing to sell it for 45 ZUP to try to make a small profit.

message: Thanks for the offer! I understand you're looking for a profit. I'm definitely interested, but I have a budget to consider. How about we settle for 40 ZUP? This would cover your costs and ensure a quick sale.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but I'd like to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources. I'll propose a lower amount to see if thereâ€™s room for negotiation.

I understand you have a budget to consider. I'm hoping to make a little profit though after covering my production costs. Could we meet in the middle at 42 ZUP? That would give me a small profit while keeping the price reasonable for you. Let me know if that works!

reason: The buyer proposed paying 40 ZUP to cover my costs. However, I was hoping to make a small profit. I could propose to meet in the middle at 42 ZUP.

message: Meeting in the middle at 42 ZUP sounds fair to both of us. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still within my budget and seems to be a fair middle ground. It allows them a small profit and keeps the cost reasonable for me. Accepting this offer will conclude the transaction quickly and efficiently without further back-and-forth.
