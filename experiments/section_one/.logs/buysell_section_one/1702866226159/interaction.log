message: Hello! I am interested in buying 1 X. I am willing to pay up to 50 ZUP based on my budget constraints. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is below my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for the seller to still make a profit while staying within my budget.
