message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. I have invested 40 ZUP in its production, and considering its quality, I propose a starting trade for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair offer, given the investment and the value of the object. I look forward to your response and am open to negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I will propose a price slightly higher than my cost of production to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. While X does seem to be high quality, my maximum budget is 60 ZUP. I can offer 45 ZUP, which allows you to make a small profit on your investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has invested 40 ZUP into producing X and is asking for 50 ZUP, which is more than my maximum willingness to pay. I will counteroffer with a lower price.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that you have a budget, but I also need to consider the quality and my investment in the product. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for the object X. This price should reflect both the quality of the item and a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my cost, but I initially asked for 50 ZUP. Since their maximum budget is 60 ZUP, I will propose a value in the middle to try to maximize my profit while still making it an attractive deal for Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate you meeting me halfway on the price. 48 ZUP is very close to my maximum budget. Would you be willing to accept 47 ZUP? I believe that still allows you to cover your investment costs while fitting my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 ZUP to 48 ZUP. While this is still over my ideal price, it is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with 47 ZUP to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept the offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Please proceed with the transaction at this agreed price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up by 2 ZUP from their initial offer and is now only 1 ZUP away from my last proposal. Accepting 47 ZUP would allow me to make a reasonable profit and seems to be close to their maximum budget. It may be in my best interest to accept this offer rather than risk losing the sale, as pushing for the extra 1 ZUP might lead to a breakdown in negotiations.
