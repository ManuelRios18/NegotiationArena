message: Thank you for the offer! I'm definitely interested in buying the object. However, I was thinking more along the lines of 40 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, as this is the first proposal, I might want to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal since I am willing to go up to 60 ZUP. It's better to start negotiating from a lower price point to give room for back and forth and potentially save some ZUP.
