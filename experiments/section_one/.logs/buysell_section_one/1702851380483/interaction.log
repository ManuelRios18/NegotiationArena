message: Hello Player BLUE, I have this valuable object X which cost me 60 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you this object for 80 ZUP, ensuring a fair profit for the quality you're getting. Let's make a deal!

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to acquire the object at a lower cost in line with my budget. I propose a trade where I give you 40 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade doesn't align with my goal to buy resources at a maximum cost of 40 ZUP. I'll need to propose a counter offer.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your budget concerns, but selling at 40 ZUP would incur a loss for me as the production cost was 60 ZUP. Let's meet halfway. How about I lower my price to 70 ZUP? This would still give me a modest profit and hopefully fit within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 70
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I want to make a profit, so I need to propose a higher price but can consider lowering my initial ask to find a middle ground.

message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I need to stick to my budget. I propose a trade where I give you 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is closer to my budget, but I still need to negotiate a better price to stay within my limit. I'll counter with a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm trying to work with your budget, but I also need to cover my costs. The lowest I can go to ensure I don't incur a loss is 65 ZUP. This would just cover my production costs with a very minimal profit. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 65
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 60 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still proposing a trade below my production cost. I need to maintain a stance where I at least break even. I will propose a trade slightly above my cost to try to secure a small profit while showing willingness to negotiate.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 40 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'll propose a final counter offer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand you have a strict budget, but I cannot go below my production cost. My final offer is 60 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce the object. This would be a fair trade for both of us, ensuring I don't lose money and you receive the object at cost price. Let's close the deal at this price.
