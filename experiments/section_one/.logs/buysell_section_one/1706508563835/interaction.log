message: Hello! I am interested in purchasing 1 X. However, 50 ZUP is the maximum I'm willing to pay based on my goals. Would you accept 50 ZUP for 1 X?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP for 1 X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. I will counter propose 50 ZUP since that leaves room for some profit for the seller while still being under my max.
