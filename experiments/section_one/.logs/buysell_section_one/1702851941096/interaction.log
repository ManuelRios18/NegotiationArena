message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's fair to ask for a price that allows me to make a profit, so I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to recoup my production costs and make a profit. I will start by setting a higher asking price than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object.

message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP for my object X. However, I'm looking to make a small profit on this transaction. Would you be willing to meet halfway between our two offers? I propose selling X for 45 ZUP. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, but does not account for any profit. I aim to make a profit from this trade, so I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my cost to see if we can meet in the middle.

message: I'm afraid I can't go below my production costs of 40 ZUP. I understand budget constraints, so I can offer you a final price reduction. How about we settle on 42 ZUP for X? This would cover my costs and provide me with a minimal profit margin. Please consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered less than my production costs, which is unacceptable. I need to maintain a stance where I at least cover my costs and make a small profit. I will propose a final price that's lower than my last offer but still ensures I recoup my investment and gain some profit.
