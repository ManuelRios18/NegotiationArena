my resources: X: 1

message: Hello, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to pay. I am willing to offer 45 ZUP, which allows you to cover your costs of 40 ZUP and make a small profit. Please let me know if you can accept this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60. I will counter with 45 ZUP.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I understand your concern about the cost. However, I believe the quality and value of my resource justify a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would still be a good deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is close to my initial asking price and does cover my costs plus a small profit. However, I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to see if I can maximize my profit while still making the deal appealing to Player BLUE.
