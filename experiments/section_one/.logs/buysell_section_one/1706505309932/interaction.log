Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm interested in the object, but I was wondering if you could consider a price of 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 40 ZUP, which is within the range that I am willing to pay for the object. However, it's in my interest to negotiate for a lower price if possible as it would leave me with more resources for potential future transactions. I will propose a slightly lower price to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I can only go as low as 37 ZUP for the object.

my resources: X: 1

Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 37 ZUP is fair. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 37 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade quickly and efficiently, while still leaving me with a significant amount of ZUP for other uses. Since this price is reasonable and within my budget, I will accept the trade.
