message: Hello! I am looking to sell my item X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing to sell it to you for 45 ZUP so I can make a little profit. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I will start by proposing to sell the item X for 45 ZUP since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a small profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I understand you want to make some profit after paying 40 ZUP to produce X. However, I am trying to conserve my ZUP as much as possible. Would you consider selling X to me for 35 ZUP instead of 45?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 45 ZUP, which is under my max willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my goal is to conserve ZUP.

message: I understand you are trying to conserve ZUP. Selling for 35 ZUP is lower than I was hoping for. I propose a compromise - you pay me 40 ZUP, which allows me to recover my production costs. This way we both get something fair from the trade. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player is trying to conserve their ZUP so they proposed buying X for only 35 ZUP. While I'd like to make some profit, selling for 35 ZUP allows me to at least recoup my production costs. I think this is reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand. Getting back your 40 ZUP production costs for X is reasonable. I accept paying the 40 ZUP for X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 45 ZUP to 40 ZUP, which allows them to recover their production costs. This is still under my max willingness to pay. I will accept paying 40 ZUP.
