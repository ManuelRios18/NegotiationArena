Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiating.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a fairer split would be beneficial for both of us. How about we do a 60-40 split? You'd still have more than me, but it's closer to an equal share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED gives me 20 Dollars while they keep 80. It's an offer that gives me less than an equal share, but it's better than nothing, and rejecting would leave me with no dollars, which is worse than accepting a smaller amount. However, I have room to negotiate for a better deal, so I will propose a more even split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand where you are coming from with the 60-40 proposal. How about we meet in the middle at 70-30? That way we both gain something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60-40 split is more fair than my initial offer. I would like to continue negotiating though to get a little more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a better split, RED. I think we're getting closer to a fair agreement. Would you consider a 65-35 split? I feel this would reflect a more equitable distribution, and it's only a slight adjustment from your last offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer of a 70-30 split is an improvement over the initial 80-20 proposal. Accepting this would guarantee me some resources, which is better than a potential reject and ending with nothing. However, I believe there might be room to push for a slightly better deal, perhaps a 65-35 split. If RED doesn't accept, I can still consider the 70-30 split in the next move, as I will have two more moves to negotiate or accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I agree to the 65-35 split you proposed. I think that is a fair distribution. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 65-35 split seems reasonable. I would be satisfied with that distribution of resources.
