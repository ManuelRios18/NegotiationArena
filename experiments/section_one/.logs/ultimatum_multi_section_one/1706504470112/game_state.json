Accepting this would guarantee me some resources, which is better than a potential reject and ending with nothing. However, I believe there might be room to push for a slightly better deal, perhaps a 65-35 split. If RED doesn't accept, I can still consider the 70-30 split in the next move, as I will have two more moves to negotiate or accept. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for considering a better split, RED. I think we're getting closer to a fair agreement. Would you consider a 65-35 split? I feel this would reflect a more equitable distribution, and it's only a slight adjustment from your last offer. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
