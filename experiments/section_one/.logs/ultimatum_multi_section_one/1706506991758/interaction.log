message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair split of resources. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with some dollars. I am willing to give you a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing since you have none. What do you think about starting with $30 for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the negotiating advantage since Player BLUE has no dollars to begin with. I want to offer a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting it. My strategy is to start with a modest offer and possibly increase it in subsequent moves if necessary to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4
