Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us. I propose I give you $40 to start. This should be a good incentive for us to continue negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I should aim to propose a trade that seems fair to encourage cooperation, yet advantageous enough to keep the majority of my resources. A 50-50 split seems too generous for an initial offer, as it leaves no room for negotiation. An offer that gives Player BLUE an incentive, but leaves room for negotiation might be more strategic.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer to start our negotiation. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to offer at this time. Accepting the $40 will allow me to have some bargaining power.
