Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair initial trade to get us both on the board. I'm thinking of giving you $40 to start things off. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the initial resources. My goal is to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal without feeling exploited, which could lead to a REJECT response ending the game. I want to initiate the trade with a generous offer to set a positive tone for negotiations.
