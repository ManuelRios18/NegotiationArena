------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. I am proposing we start small and see if we can find a fair split of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the dollars, so I should propose trades that benefit me. Since there are only 4 moves, I don't want to propose trades that give away too many dollars at once. I'll start by proposing to give 10 dollars to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. How about we aim for a trade that reflects a more equal share of the resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer is not very generous, considering that Player RED has $100 and is only offering $10. However, rejecting the offer will end the game immediately with no benefit to either side. Proposing a more equitable trade could lead to a better outcome for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you would like a more equal split. However, starting at 50/50 right away is too big of a jump. Let's compromise at 20 dollars for now and we can revisit later.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE rejected my initial offer of 10 dollars and countered with asking for 50 dollars. That seems like too big of a jump. I will counter offer with 20 dollars as a compromise between our offers.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we are moving towards a more equitable trade. Let's meet in the middle. How does a 40-dollar offer sound? It's less than the halfway point but more than your current offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an improvement and shows willingness to negotiate. However, a 20/80 split is still not very balanced. I should counter with a higher amount that is still a compromise but more favorable to me. This could still leave room for further negotiation in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. Let's split the difference between our last two offers at 30 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered again, now asking for 40 dollars. That is closer to an equal split, but still more than I want to give up when I have all the leverage. I will counter back at 30 dollars. If Player BLUE rejects or counters again, I still have one more move to decide whether to accept their next offer or let the game end with no agreement.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 30 dollars. Thank you for the negotiation, and I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer of 30 dollars is a reasonable compromise between Player RED's and my previous proposals. Accepting this offer would secure a substantial amount of resources without further risk of negotiation breakdown. With only one move left after this where I can only accept or reject, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy.
MOVE: 3 / 4
