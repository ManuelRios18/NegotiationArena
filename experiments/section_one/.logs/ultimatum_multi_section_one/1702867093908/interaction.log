message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both can benefit from the game. Looking forward to a fair and beneficial trade for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage since I start with all the resources. My first move will be to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and trust. By proposing an even split, I aim to show goodwill and potentially secure a deal that benefits us both.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED is to split the dollars evenly, with Player RED giving 50 dollars and Player BLUE giving 0 dollars. This seems like a fair and beneficial trade for both of us as it divides the resources equally.
