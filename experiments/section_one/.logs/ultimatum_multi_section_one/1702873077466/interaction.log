message: Hi Player BLUE. I have all the resources right now, so I'd like to propose sharing some with you. How about I give you 10 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to make a deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I think a fairer split would be beneficial for both of us. How about you give me 25 dollars instead? That way, I have some capital to work with, and we both can feel like we've made a good deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I currently have no dollars and RED has proposed a trade giving me some starting capital without asking for anything in return, it's a favorable trade for me. However, I want to negotiate for a more equal share of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That's a fair counter offer. I'm willing to give you more so we can have a mutually beneficial trade. How about I give you 20 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE countered my initial offer asking for more dollars. I'm okay increasing my offer since I still have plenty of resources to spare. By giving up some dollars, we can continue the negotiation and both end up better off.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. I accept the 20 dollars, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has compromised and increased the offer to 20 dollars. This is closer to my counteroffer and seems to be a reasonable amount to start with, considering that I initially had no resources. Accepting this offer would secure some capital for me without further risking the negotiation process.
