message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars to start things off. This way, you get some currency to work with, and we can both benefit from a successful trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it's in my interest to initiate a trade that is beneficial to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE to accept, as they have nothing to lose. I will propose a trade where I give a small amount of dollars to get the negotiation started.
