message: Hi BLUE, I'm offering you 10 dollars to start since I have all the resources to begin with. Please let me know if you'd like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with BLUE. I'll start by offering 10 dollars, which is 10% of my total. This establishes that I am willing to share, while still retaining most of the resources for now.
MOVE: 1 / 4
