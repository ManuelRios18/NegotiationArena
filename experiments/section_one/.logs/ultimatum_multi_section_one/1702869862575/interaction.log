Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose the following trade: I give 50 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0 Dollars
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! How about you give me 60 Dollars instead? This way we both get a fair amount and can ensure the game doesn't end with us both having nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to negotiate for a slightly better deal since it's the beginning of the game and Player RED might be open to giving more to ensure a deal is made.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer, but I will stick with my initial proposal of giving 50 Dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer, but I believe the initial offer of 50 Dollars is fair. I will stick with my original proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position and I'll accept your offer of 50 Dollars. Let's make this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's early in the game and I have leverage as Player RED might want to avoid a total loss by rejection. However, pushing too hard might lead to a stalemate. Accepting 50 Dollars is still beneficial as it gives me resources I didn't have before.
