Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair deal to make the game interesting for both of us. I propose splitting the dollars evenly. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I am the only player with resources, I will propose an initial trade to start the game with a fair split, offering Player BLUE half of my dollars. This creates a cooperative tone and gives an incentive for Player BLUE to engage positively.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair opening offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair to start. I don't have any resources to offer at this point, so I'll accept the proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4
