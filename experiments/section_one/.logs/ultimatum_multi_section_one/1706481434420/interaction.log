message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some dollars to even the playing field a bit. Let's make this game interesting!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is fair but also leaves me with a significant advantage, considering I am the only player with resources to start. I propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game, but not so much that it doesn't acknowledge my starting advantage.
