message: Hello BLUE, I think an equal split would be fair. Let's start there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree, an equal split is fair. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an equal split seems fair for the first proposal. This way, both players benefit and the risk of a total loss is avoided. Accepting this trade will secure a positive outcome for me, considering I started with no resources.
