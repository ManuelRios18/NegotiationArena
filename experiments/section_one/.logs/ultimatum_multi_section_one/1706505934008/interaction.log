message: Hi BLUE, let's work together on this. I propose giving you 40 dollars, so we both benefit. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair trade to establish a cooperative relationship with Player BLUE. I'll propose a split that gives me a slight advantage since I'm the one with the initial resources. If BLUE accepts, we both walk away with a significant amount of dollars, which is better than the zero-sum outcome of a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, I agree let's work together so we both end up with some resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I should accept Player RED's generous offer to give me 40 dollars. This benefits both of us.
