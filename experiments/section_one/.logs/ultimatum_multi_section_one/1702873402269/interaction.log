Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you don't have resources to trade right now. I'm going to increase my offer to 30 dollars since we are getting close to the end of the game. I hope this provides enough incentive for us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if you would like to counter or accept the offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue has not provided any counteroffers, so I will increase my offer again to try to incentivize them to engage in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Blue, this is our last chance to reach an agreement. I'm willing to offer you 40 dollars, which I hope provides enough incentive for you to accept. Otherwise we will both lose all of our resources. Please let me know if you can accept this final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the final move and Blue has not engaged at all or provided any counters. I will propose one final offer to try to get some agreement since otherwise we will both lose our resources if no agreement is reached.
