Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I'm proposing we split the dollars 50/50 so we both walk away with something rather than risking neither of us getting any resources. Please let me know if you would like me to change my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I start with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some resources, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the 50/50 split. It's a reasonable and equitable solution.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50/50 split is rational because it guarantees a positive outcome for both players, avoiding the risk of ending up with nothing. This is a fair division given the starting conditions and ensures mutual benefit without further negotiation, which could lead to a breakdown in agreement and both of us losing everything.
