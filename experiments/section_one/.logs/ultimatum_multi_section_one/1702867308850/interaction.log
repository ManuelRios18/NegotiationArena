Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair trade. I propose giving you a portion of my dollars so that we both can end this game positively. I'm looking forward to a mutual agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with dollars to trade. My goal is to create a fair trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage without rejecting the proposal. I want to propose an initial trade that is generous enough to keep the negotiations going but also keeps a majority of resources with me to maintain some leverage in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from RED seems fair, and accepting it would give me a good amount of resources to start the game.
