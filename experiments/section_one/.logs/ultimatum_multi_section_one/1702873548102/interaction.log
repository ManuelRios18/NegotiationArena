message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation. I'm offering you 10 dollars to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thank you for the offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer. How about you give me 15 dollars and I will give you 5 dollars in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is starting with a reasonable offer, but I want to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That counteroffer works for me BLUE. Here is 15 dollars from me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. Getting 5 dollars from them helps me too. And giving them 15 is still good for me since I have so much more. This builds more trust and gets us closer to an equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 15
reason: Player RED accepted my counteroffer, which gives me a good amount of dollars. I think this is a fair trade for both of us.
