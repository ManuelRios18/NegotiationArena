message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing, as a way to kickstart our negotiations. Let's both walk away with something from this game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game and accept my proposal. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars. By offering a split that leans in my favor, I can attempt to retain a majority of the resources while still giving Player BLUE an amount they might find acceptable. I will offer Player BLUE 40 dollars, keeping 60 for myself, as an opening move.
MOVE: 1 / 4
