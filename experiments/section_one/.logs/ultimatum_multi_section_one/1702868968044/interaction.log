Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split of our resources. This way, we both can benefit from the game. What do you think about splitting the dollars 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the power to initiate the trade and I have all the resources. My goal is to reach a fair trade with Player BLUE, so that the game can end with both of us having some resources, rather than rejecting a proposal and ending the game with nothing. I will propose an equal split to show good faith and willingness to cooperate, as this is our only interaction.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That is a generous offer. I accept splitting the dollars 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: An equal split seems fair. I don't have any resources to contribute, so I will accept the offer.
