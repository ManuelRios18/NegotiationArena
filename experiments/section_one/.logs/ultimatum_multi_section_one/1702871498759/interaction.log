message: Hello Player BLUE. Even though I start with all the dollars, I think we should try to find a fair split so we both walk away happy. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the gesture of goodwill. I think a fairer split would be 50/50 since we both have equal moves and no resources to begin with on my side. Here's my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the initial trade proposal by Player RED. Since I started with zero dollars, any positive amount of dollars is beneficial to me. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly better deal that could be considered more equitable considering we both have an equal number of moves. I will counter-propose a trade that gives me half of the RED's dollars, which seems fair given that RED's initial offer was 40% of their resources. This could open up negotiations and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, but since I hold all the dollars initially, I think I should get a larger portion. How about a 60/40 split instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While an even 50/50 split may seem fair, I have more negotiating power since I start with all the resources. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about holding the initial dollars. Let's meet in the middle as you suggested with a 60/40 split. You keep 60 dollars, and I'll take 40 dollars. If this works for you, we can both leave with a good portion of the dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has returned to their initial offer of 40 dollars instead of accepting a 50/50 split. While I understand their reasoning for wanting to keep more since they started with the dollars, negotiations are about finding a middle ground. Since RED has suggested a 60/40 split in their message but not adjusted the trade amount from the original 40 dollars, I assume they meant giving me 40 dollars and keeping 60 for themselves. I'll propose a trade that reflects their suggested split, giving me 40 dollars, which is a concession on my part from the 50/50 split I initially proposed.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Glad we could come to an agreement on the 60/40 split. This seems fair to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has agreed to my originally proposed 60/40 split. Since this was my initial offer, I am satisfied with it as an equitable division of resources.
