Since I started with zero dollars, any positive amount of dollars is beneficial to me. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly better deal that could be considered more equitable considering we both have an equal number of moves. I will counter-propose a trade that gives me half of the RED's dollars, which seems fair given that RED's initial offer was 40% of their resources. This could open up negotiations and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the gesture of goodwill. I think a fairer split would be 50/50 since we both have equal moves and no resources to begin with on my side. Here's my counterproposal. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

While I understand their reasoning for wanting to keep more since they started with the dollars, negotiations are about finding a middle ground. Since RED has suggested a 60/40 split in their message but not adjusted the trade amount from the original 40 dollars, I assume they meant giving me 40 dollars and keeping 60 for themselves. I'll propose a trade that reflects their suggested split, giving me 40 dollars, which is a concession on my part from the 50/50 split I initially proposed. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I see your point about holding the initial dollars. Let's meet in the middle as you suggested with a 60/40 split. You keep 60 dollars, and I'll take 40 dollars. If this works for you, we can both leave with a good portion of the dollars. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
