message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 30 dollars for free to start things off. This way, we both can walk away with something, and it's better than risking a rejection and ending up with nothing. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I'm in a position of power with all the resources. I aim to propose a trade that is fair enough to prevent Player BLUE from rejecting it outright, but also advantageous enough to keep the majority of the dollars for myself. A reasonable starting proposal might be to offer Player BLUE 30 dollars in exchange for nothing, to incentivize them to keep playing and potentially accept the deal.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars for free, which is very generous. I should accept this offer so we both end up with some resources rather than risking a rejection.
