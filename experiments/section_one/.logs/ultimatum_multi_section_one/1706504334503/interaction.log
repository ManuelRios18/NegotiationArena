message: Hi Player BLUE, I have all the resources right now, but I think we could both benefit if we split them. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to test if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED currently has all the resources. Their proposed trade gives me some resources, which is better than nothing. I don't have anything to trade at the moment, so I will accept their offer as a starting point.
