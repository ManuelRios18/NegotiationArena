Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I think a fair proposal is for me to give you 50 dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal 50/50 split since this seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I think 50 dollars is a reasonable start. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of 50 dollars seems fair as it gives me resources without any immediate risk. There is a potential to negotiate for more, but there's also the risk of RED rejecting and ending the game with no benefit to either of us. I will accept the offer to secure the 50 dollars.
