Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars to get us started. Let's work together to make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I will propose an opening trade that is favorable to me but still offers value to BLUE, in order to start negotiations on a positive note and to avoid an immediate rejection. My aim is to incentivize BLUE to engage in a trade rather than end the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I accept your proposal for the trade. Let's work together to make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the first move, so I have the option to either accept, reject, or propose a new trade. Given that I currently have no resources, it would be beneficial for me to receive a significant amount of dollars as proposed.
