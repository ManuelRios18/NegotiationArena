message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation with a fair offer. I propose a 50-50 split of my dollars. This way, we both have equal resources to walk away with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation process with Player BLUE. I aim to propose a trade that is favorable enough to encourage Player BLUE to engage in the game, but also not too generous as I need to maintain a significant portion of my resources. I will propose a 50-50 split as it is a straightforward and fair starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the offer. I understand your proposal, but I'd like to suggest a more balanced split. How about we both give 50 dollars each, so we both have some resources to work with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal is not favorable for me as it leaves me with no resources. I need to make a counteroffer to ensure a more balanced outcome.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, it seems there might be a confusion. You don't have any dollars to trade at the moment. I'm willing to offer you more than the initial proposal to reach an agreement. How about I give you 60 dollars and we call it a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not logical because Player BLUE does not have any dollars to begin with. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding on their part. I will clarify the situation and make a slightly more generous offer to move the negotiation forward.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the improved offer. However, I am still unable to contribute any dollars at the moment. Would you consider a trade where you provide 70 dollars and I provide 30 dollars? This way, I can have some resources to work with as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 30
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me a more favorable deal, but I still have no resources to contribute. I need to try to negotiate a better position for myself.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I think there is still some confusion. You don't have any dollars to contribute to the trade. However, I value a fair deal and want to end this negotiation positively. I'm willing to make my final offer now: I will give you 70 dollars, and I will keep 30 dollars. This is the best offer I will make and I hope you find it acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has again suggested a trade where they give 30 dollars, which they do not have. It's clear that there is a misunderstanding or a strategic move from Player BLUE's side. Since Player BLUE has no dollars to trade, I will stick to giving and not receiving any dollars. I will make my final offer more generous to incentivize acceptance, while still keeping a significant portion of my resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your final offer. I will accept the trade of 70 dollars for me and 30 dollars for you. Thank you for the fair deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a final offer, and it's clear that I cannot contribute any dollars. I need to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it.
