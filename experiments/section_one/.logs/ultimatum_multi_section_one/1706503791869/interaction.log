Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to end up with some amount of dollars. Here is an initial offer to split the dollars. Please let me know if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I start with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end up with some amount, rather than risk rejecting and losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with an offer for me to give 40 and for them to give 10. I'd like to counter again to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a different split. How about 30 for you and 15 for me?

my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to try to negotiate a more favorable split for myself.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I can agree to the 30/15 split so we both end up with some dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE proposed a 30/15 split. I would prefer a little more, but I think this is reasonable enough to accept so we both end up with some amount rather than risk rejecting.
