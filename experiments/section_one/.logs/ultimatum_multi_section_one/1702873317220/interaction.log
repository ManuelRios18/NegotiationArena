message: Hello BLUE. I propose to give you 10 dollars to start our negotiation. Please let me know if you would like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial offer to give Player BLUE 10 dollars, keeping 90 dollars for myself. This allows me to retain most of the money while still offering a fair opening offer to establish negotiations.
