Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both benefit and have a fair share of the resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade with Player BLUE to incentivize them to ACCEPT. I'll propose a trade that splits the resources evenly, as there is no benefit to me if Player BLUE rejects and causes both of us to lose everything. A 50/50 split seems like a rational starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to split the dollars evenly. This seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great! I'm glad we're in agreement. Let's finalize this trade and both benefit from the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Player BLUE has agreed to the even split and did not make a counter-proposal, I will accept the original trade I proposed. By doing this, we both walk away with resources, and the game ends successfully for both parties. There is no advantage in continuing the game or risking a rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 4
