Turn: 0

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is still considering, so I'll give them more time and stand by my offer. Towards the end here, I should start thinking about whether I want to propose something different or if I'm willing to risk losing everything by rejecting. For now, I'll stay patient.

Turn: 1

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, this is my last move. I'm going to go ahead and accept the current offer since I'd rather take the 90 dollars than risk losing it all. Let me know your decision!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move. BLUE seems to still be considering, but has run out of moves. I could try negotiating more, but at this point it seems unlikely we'll find an agreement. I'd rather take the sure thing of getting 90 dollars than risk rejecting and losing it all.
