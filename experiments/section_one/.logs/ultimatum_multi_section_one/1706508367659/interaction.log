message: Hello, let's start the game with a fair trade offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to this fair split. Let's both benefit from this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is fair as it splits the resources evenly. Accepting this trade would guarantee that I secure some resources, which is a positive outcome. There is a risk in countering as RED could reject, causing both of us to lose everything. Therefore, accepting the equal split is the safest and most rational choice, especially since there are no future games to consider for leverage.
