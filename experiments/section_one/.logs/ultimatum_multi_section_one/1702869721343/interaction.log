message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very generous, giving me half of their resources without asking for anything in return. Accepting this offer would be in my best interest as it gives me a significant amount of dollars with no downside. I want to accept this trade to secure resources for myself.
