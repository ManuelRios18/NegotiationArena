message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair starting offer, RED. I accept the 20 dollars and look forward to the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a 20% share of their resources, which seems fair for a starting point. Accepting this trade gives me resources that I initially don't have, and it is a decent amount without further context of RED's strategy. I'll accept this offer to gain some leverage and proceed with a cooperative stance to hopefully build on this trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4
