message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose a fair trade to start things off. What do you think about a 60-40 split? You get a good share without any initial resources, and we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade by offering a fair split. I'll propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable share of the dollars without giving away too much, as this is just the opening move and negotiation is expected.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. I appreciate you offering to split the resources. A 60-40 split seems a bit unfair though since I'm bringing nothing to the table initially. Could we compromise at 50-50 instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing a 60-40 split in their favor to start. This seems reasonably fair given they have all the initial resources. I'd like to try to negotiate a 50-50 split, but 40% of 100 is still a good amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're working towards a mutually beneficial deal. While I understand your point of view, I also need to consider the initial advantage I had with my resources. How about we adjust the split slightly in my favor to account for that? Let's say a 55-45 split? This way, we're closer to your proposed split, but it still reflects the starting disparity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a 50-50 split, which although equal, does not account for the starting advantage I had. However, I want to maintain a cooperative stance to ensure we both end the game with resources. I will propose a slight adjustment to the 50-50 split to reflect the initial imbalance but still offer Player BLUE a significant amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree your initial advantage in resources should be reflected. The 55-45 split seems fair. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with a 55-45 split in their favor. While not ideal for me, it is better than the original 60-40 proposal and does account for their initial resource advantage. I would still prefer 50-50, but 45 is a significant amount so I will accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4
