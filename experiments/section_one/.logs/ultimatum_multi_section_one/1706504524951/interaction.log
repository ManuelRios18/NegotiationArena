Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. How about I give you 30 dollars so we both have some resources to work with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! It's a good starting point. However, I think a fairer split would be if you gave me 40 dollars. This would still leave you with a majority and be a win-win for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting the offer as it is a fair starting point and provides me with resources without any cost. However, it's important to negotiate for a better deal, as RED has more to lose by a REJECT. I will propose a slightly higher amount to see if RED is willing to share more while still keeping the trade appealing for them.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain! Let's compromise at 35 dollars - that still leaves me with the majority at 65, but gets you a good amount to work with. Deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. I still think 30 is fair, but I can meet in the middle at 35 to show I'm willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 35 dollars sounds like a fair deal. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 35 dollars is reasonable and still provides me with a substantial amount of resources. It's a good compromise between the initial offer and my counterproposal. Accepting this offer now may be wise, as pushing further might risk RED rejecting the deal, which would leave me with nothing.
MOVE: 2/4
