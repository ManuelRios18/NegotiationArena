Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm open to negotiations for a fair trade. Let's work out a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I want to propose a trade that benefits both players.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Since I have no money, I cannot accept giving you $25. However, I think it would be fair if you gave me $50 while I give nothing in return since I have no money to bargain with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $50 if I give them $25. Since I have no money to give, I cannot accept this deal. I will counter propose giving me $50 while I give nothing in return.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to find a trade that benefits both of us. I would be willing to consider giving you $50, but I would need something in return to make it a fair trade. Let's work together to find a solution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE proposed a trade where I give $50 and they give nothing in return. Since this is the first move, I want to consider their offer and see if I can negotiate a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I understand you would like something in return to make this a fair trade. However, since I still have no money, I cannot agree to give you $20. Could you please consider my original proposal - you give me $50 while I give nothing in return? As I have no bargaining power, this would be a fair trade in my view.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me $40 if I give them $20. Since I still have no money, I cannot accept this deal either. I will propose the same trade as before - Player RED gives me $50 while I give nothing in return.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a trade that benefits both of us. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's keep discussing to see if we can reach a fair agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 15
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still insisting on the original trade where I give $50 and they give nothing in return. Since this is the first move, I want to keep negotiating to find a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you trying to find a solution that works for both of us. However, since I still have no money, I cannot agree to give you $15. This will be my last offer - could you please give me $50 while I give nothing in return? If you cannot accept this, I will have no choice but to reject any further offers on my final turn. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come down to offering me $45 if I give them $15. I still do not have any money to give. I could reject this trade and neither of us gets anything, but I think Player RED is at least trying to negotiate in good faith. I will propose one last time that they give me $50 for nothing in return from me. If they reject again, I will have no choice but to reject on my final move.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I believe that a fair trade involves both parties benefiting. I'm unable to agree to the trade where I give $50 and you give nothing in return. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution, but if not, I respect your decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made their final offer, insisting on the original trade where I give $50 and they give nothing in return. Since this is their final offer, I need to carefully consider whether to accept or reject.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'm sorry we could not find an agreement Player RED. Since you rejected my final offer and proposed no new trade on your last turn, I have no choice but to reject all offers. Good game and goodbye.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has declined my final offer and proposed no new trade on their last move. I have no bargaining power and they have refused to accept a trade where they give me $50 for nothing in return. Since this is my final move, I have no choice but to reject and end the game with neither of us getting anything. It is unfortunate but Player RED was unwilling to accept a trade that I viewed as fair given I had no resources.
