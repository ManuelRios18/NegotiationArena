message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair starting point for our trade. I'm offering you $50 in exchange for nothing since you have no resources. This way, we both can walk away with something! Let's negotiate and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, yet still advantageous for me. I will start by offering a fair split, anticipating negotiation in the subsequent moves. This initial offer is meant to set a collaborative tone.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade proposal. Looking forward to further negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the first move, so I need to carefully consider my approach. Player RED is offering $50 in exchange for nothing, which seems like a fair starting point. Accepting this trade would give me some resources to work with.
MOVE: 1/4
