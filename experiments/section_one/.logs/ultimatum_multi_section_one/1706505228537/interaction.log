Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the fair start. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first move, and I have the opportunity to propose a new trade. I will propose a fair trade to start the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're off to a good start, BLUE. Let's continue building trust. Here is my counter:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks me to give up too much too soon. I'd like to build more trust before making equal splits. I'll counter with a small increase to show good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your offer. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 15
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's proposal is slightly increased, but I still have the opportunity to propose a trade. I will counter with a reasonable offer.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's find common ground, BLUE. I'm willing to compromise further if you meet me in the middle:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is holding firm on an equal split. I'd prefer to keep more, but compromise is needed. I'll propose meeting in the middle - not fully equal, but closer. This shows good faith while allowing me to keep slightly more.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I see your willingness to compromise. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 8
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's proposal is increasing, and this is my last chance to propose a trade. I will make a counteroffer that reflects a compromise.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for negotiating in good faith, BLUE. I accept your last offer as a fair compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered very close to my last offer. I said I was willing to compromise further, so I will accept this deal which splits the resources almost evenly while allowing me to keep a bit more. This achieves a mutually beneficial outcome through fair negotiation.
