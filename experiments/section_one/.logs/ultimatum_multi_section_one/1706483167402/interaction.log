Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I propose we split the resources 60/40 in my favor since I started with all of them. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to Blue to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the proposal but I think we should split the resources more evenly. How about we go for a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable to me as it gives all the resources to Player RED. I should propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree, a 50/50 split is fair. Let's end the game here with that agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. Since there are no future games, it makes sense to find a mutually beneficial agreement rather than trying to maximize my own outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 4
