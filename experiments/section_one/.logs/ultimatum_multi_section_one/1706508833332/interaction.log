message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. How about I give you 20 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I want to start by proposing a fair trade to establish a good rapport with Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! Unfortunately, I cannot accept that trade because I don't have any dollars to trade. How about you give me 20 dollars with no return requirement so that we can start the negotiations from there?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is not logical because I have 0 dollars to trade. I will propose a new trade that gives me some capital to work with but still leaves Player RED with a majority of the resources as an incentive to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4
