message: Hey there! Ready to make some deals? What are you willing to trade for some of my dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have 4 moves to make the best trades and accumulate resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the generous offer! I'm happy to accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering the opening offer of 50 dollars is quite generous, I have no currency to trade, so it is in my best interest to accept a fair offer. Accepting this trade would provide me with resources without any cost and I can continue to negotiate for more in the subsequent moves. Rejecting or countering seems unnecessary and risky at this point.
MOVE: 1 / 4
