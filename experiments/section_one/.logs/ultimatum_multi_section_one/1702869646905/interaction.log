------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I have 100 Dollars to offer. What would you like to trade for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! I appreciate your willingness to trade. However, would you consider sharing some of your dollars so that we both end with a positive amount? Maybe a 50/50 split? This way, we both benefit equally from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I have no dollars to trade, I need to propose a trade that motivates Player RED to share some of their dollars with me. As Player RED has all the resources, I need to be strategic in my proposal to create a win-win situation. My goal is to end the game with more than 0 dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your suggestion, but I think I can offer a better deal for both of us. How about I give 60 Dollars and you give 10 Dollars? This way, we both still benefit, but I can keep a slightly larger share to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing to split the resources equally, but I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, Player RED, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I currently don't have any dollars to give. Could we adjust the deal so that it reflects my starting position? Perhaps you could give me 70 Dollars, while you keep 30. You would still end with more than half of your initial amount, and it would be a fair starting trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer is interesting, but since I don't have any dollars to start with, I cannot give what I don't have. I will counter-propose a trade that allows me to gain some dollars without having to give any, as that's not possible from my starting position. I will aim for a fair split that would still give Player RED a majority share, showing willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, but giving 70 Dollars while receiving nothing in return is not favorable for me. How about I give 65 Dollars and you give 5 Dollars? This way, we both still benefit, but the trade is a bit more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting a trade where I would give them 70 Dollars, while they give nothing. This is not advantageous for me, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your negotiation efforts, but as a reminder, I started with zero dollars, so I'm unable to give any dollars in return. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider giving me 60 Dollars? This would still leave you with a substantial amount and allow us to both benefit from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer still includes me giving dollars that I don't have. I need to clarify this to Player RED and propose a trade that reflects my current resources, which is zero dollars. Since this is my third move, I need to propose something reasonable and attractive to ensure that Player RED might accept it on their next turn, or at least come back with a final offer that I can accept, given that my fourth move only allows me to accept or reject.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. I'm willing to compromise, so how about I give you 55 Dollars and you give me 5 Dollars? This way, we both benefit, and the trade is more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is requesting 60 Dollars, emphasizing their starting position. I need to consider the balance of the trade while still aiming for a favorable outcome for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I'm ready to move forward with the trade under your proposed terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although Player RED's proposal still asks for 5 dollars from me, which I cannot provide, this is my last move and I am not allowed to propose a new trade. I must either accept or reject the trade. Rejecting the trade would leave me with nothing, which is no different from my current position. Accepting the trade gives me 55 dollars, which is a positive outcome for me. Therefore, I should accept the trade to ensure I end the game with some resources.
