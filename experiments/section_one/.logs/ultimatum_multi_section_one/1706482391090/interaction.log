message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to give you 50 Dollars in exchange for 1 imaginary item. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives imaginary item: 1
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE. Since they have no resources, I will offer to give them 50 Dollars in exchange for 1 imaginary item. This way, I can establish a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Hello Player RED. I unfortunately do not have any imaginary items to trade. Could you propose an alternative trade where I give up nothing but still receive some Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives nothing: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I do not actually have any imaginary items to trade, so I cannot accept Player RED's proposed trade. However, I would like to try to negotiate to get some Dollars.

message: Hey Player BLUE, I understand that you don't have any imaginary items to trade. How about I give you 20 Dollars without asking for anything in return? Let me know if that works for you!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives nothing: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE does not have any imaginary items to trade, so I will propose a new trade where I give them 20 Dollars without asking for anything in return. This could be a good way to establish goodwill and potentially open up future negotiations.
