Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair negotiation. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. But I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: I'm happy to consider a counteroffer if you think 20 is not enough. Let me know what you think is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not make a counteroffer, so I will keep my existing offer for now. I still think 20 is a fair opening bid that leaves plenty for both of us.
