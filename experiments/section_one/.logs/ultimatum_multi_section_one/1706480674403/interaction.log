message: Hello BLUE, let's start off with a cooperative spirit. I propose a trade where I give you a significant amount to show good faith and hopefully work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I possess all the resources. To encourage cooperation and to avoid a total loss for both players, I will propose an initial generous trade to Player BLUE. This could build trust and make future negotiations smoother.
