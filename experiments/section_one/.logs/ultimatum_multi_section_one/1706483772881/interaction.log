Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. Let's start small and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks RED for the offer. I appreciate the willingness to share. Could we possibly make it a bit more balanced for this first move? Maybe a trade of $15 instead of $10? This would still leave you with a significant majority and show good faith for future moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the current offer from RED. A trade of $10 for nothing is a good starting point for negotiation. It allows us to potentially build trust and signals RED's willingness to share resources. I could accept this trade to get the game going on a positive note and to secure some amount of dollars for myself. However, since I have no resources, I might want to propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself while still keeping it reasonable enough for RED to consider.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, $15 seems fair for the first move. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. I still maintain the majority of resources, so I don't mind increasing my offer to $15 to build more goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks, RED! I agree to the $15 trade and look forward to continuing this positive exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has agreed to my counteroffer, which is a positive development. Accepting the trade of $15 will give me some initial resources and help establish a cooperative dynamic between us. It is a good strategy to accept a fair offer and build upon the goodwill for the next moves.
MOVE: 2/4
