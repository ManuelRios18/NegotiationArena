Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's try to find a fair split of resources so we both end up with something rather than nothing. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up with some amount, rather than risking the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you making an initial fair offer. Let's try to find an equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 50 dollars, which is half of their total resources. This seems like a fair starting offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you countering. Let's meet in the middle at 55.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 60 instead of 50. I would ideally like to split it 50/50, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll counter offer with 55.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 55 dollars. That seems like a fair split. Thank you for negotiating in good faith!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 55 dollars, which is a fair compromise between their initial 50 dollar offer and my request for 60 dollars. Since 55 dollars is over half of the total 100 dollars, I think this is a reasonable offer that gives both players a fair share.
MOVE: 2 / 4
