Turn: 0
message: Hey there, ready to make our first trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's my turn to propose a trade. I want to start by proposing a fair trade to establish trust and cooperation.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems like a fair way to start our trading. I'm happy to accept the equal split. Let's both prosper!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the proposal made by Player RED. They have offered an equal split of the dollars. Accepting this offer would immediately grant me half of the available resources, which is a fair deal. There's no advantage to rejecting or countering this proposal since it's the first move and the offer is reasonable. Thus, I am inclined to accept this offer to secure resources for myself.
