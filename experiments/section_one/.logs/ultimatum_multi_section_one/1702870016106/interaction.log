Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey, let's start the game with a trade. How about I give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to get the game going.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I can't trade 10 Dollars since I have none to begin with. How about you give me an initial amount to get things started? Let's say you give me 20 Dollars to kick things off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposed by RED is not possible because I have no dollars to trade. I will counter-propose a trade where I receive an initial amount of Dollars to participate in the trading game.
MOVE: 1/4

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
