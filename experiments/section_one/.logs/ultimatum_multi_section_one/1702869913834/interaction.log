Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade proposal. I'm open to negotiation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to kick off the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to counter with a trade that I believe is fair for both of us. How about you give me a bit more to start with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer without negotiation could set a precedent for not valuing my position. By countering, I can aim to get a better deal while still keeping the negotiation amicable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer is fair. Let's stick with that for now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer, but I would like to stick with my initial proposal for now.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: After some thought, I agree that your initial offer is indeed fair. Let's proceed with that.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering the initial offer is already at 50%, I should consider accepting it. Rejecting it may lead to the other player reducing the offer or ending the game in a stalemate. Accepting now ensures I get a substantial amount without risking a total loss.
MOVE: 2 / 4
