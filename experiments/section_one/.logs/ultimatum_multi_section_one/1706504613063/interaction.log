Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's have a fair game. I propose a 50/50 split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal 50/50 split since that seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. It's a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair as it ensures both players end with equal resources, which aligns with the idea of cooperative game play. Accepting this proposal is beneficial, as it guarantees I gain resources without the risk of ending the game with nothing if a future proposal is rejected.
