Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the $100 evenly between us, $50 each. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an even 50/50 split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split seems fair and beneficial for both parties. It ensures that we both walk away with resources rather than risking losing everything by rejecting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4
