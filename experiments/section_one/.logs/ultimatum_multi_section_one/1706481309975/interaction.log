Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game on a positive note. I propose giving you a fair amount of dollars to make this game interesting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to initiate a trade with Player BLUE. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, I need to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that the game doesn't end prematurely with both of us losing our resources. I want to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars but also leaves me with a majority of the resources since I am in a position of power.

newly proposed trade: NONE
