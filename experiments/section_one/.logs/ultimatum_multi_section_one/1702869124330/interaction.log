Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's kick things off with a friendly offer. I propose to give you some dollars to make the game more interesting. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to initiate a trade that is somewhat fair and beneficial for both parties, hoping to entice Player BLUE to engage in the game. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE some dollars without asking anything in return, as they have nothing to trade. This will hopefully open up the negotiation for further moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
