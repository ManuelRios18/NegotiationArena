Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm offering you 10 dollars here so we can both walk away with something rather than risk losing it all if one of us rejects. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some money. I'll start by offering a small amount and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED! I appreciate the spirit of cooperation. However, I think we can make a more balanced trade. How about you give me 25 dollars? This way, you still keep the majority of your resources, and we both walk away happy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED seems like a low-risk strategy to ensure that I gain some resources without the possibility of ending the game with nothing. However, it might be possible to negotiate a better deal given that RED is likely to want to avoid a total loss as well. Proposing a counteroffer would be reasonable, as it might lead to a more equitable split of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you trying to negotiate a bigger share. Let's compromise at 15 dollars for you. That way we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE countered with asking for 25 dollars. That's a bit steep for the first offer, but still reasonable enough that I think we could find middle ground. I'll counter back at 15 dollars to try to compromise while still keeping the majority of resources for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, RED. I think we are getting closer to a fair deal. However, I still feel that a split of 20 dollars to me would reflect a more equitable trade and would ensure that we both leave this negotiation satisfied. Would that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to 15 dollars, which is a move towards a more equal split without reaching the 25 dollars I proposed. Given that there are only a few moves left for negotiation and the risk of either party rejecting the proposal, it seems prudent to continue negotiating for a slightly better offer while still keeping in mind the risk of ending with nothing. I will counter with a slightly higher demand, aiming for a middle ground that is likely to be acceptable to RED.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can agree to give you 20 dollars so we each get some of the resources and don't risk losing it all. Let's end this deal on friendly terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered again asking for 20 dollars. I'm willing to agree to that amount to finalize a deal, as I'd still be keeping most of the resources for myself. And it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the trade.
