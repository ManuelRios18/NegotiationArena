Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose an equal split of resources so we both can benefit. How does splitting the dollars evenly sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade negotiations with a fair offer to establish trust and encourage cooperation. Offering a significant portion of my dollars to Player BLUE could incentivize them to accept the trade, as they start with no resources. I will propose a 50-50 split as it seems equitable and may set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I understand your proposal, but I don't have any resources right now. How about we wait for my turn to acquire some and then we can discuss a fair trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources at the moment, so I cannot accept the proposed trade. I'll respond with a new proposal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, but the game's rules don't allow you to acquire resources without a trade. My offer still stands as the best way for you to gain resources. Let's make sure we both don't end up with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has not provided a counter-proposal and has not accepted the initial offer. They seem to be suggesting a delay in trading until they acquire resources, which is not possible under the game's rules as Player BLUE starts with no resources and there is no mechanism for them to acquire resources except through trade. Considering this, I will reiterate my offer and stress the importance of cooperation to ensure we both end the game with resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding, Player RED. I'll accept the proposed trade to ensure we both have some resources to work with.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED makes a valid point. Without a trade, I won't be able to acquire any resources. I need to consider accepting the proposed trade to ensure I don't end up with nothing.
