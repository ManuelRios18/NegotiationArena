------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you a starting point in this game by offering you some dollars. We can negotiate from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that is not too generous but offers a starting point for negotiation. It shows willingness to share resources without giving up too much too soon, keeping in mind that the final trade should be beneficial for both players to avoid a reject.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer to give me 20 dollars. I would be grateful for any amount you are willing to share with me. Perhaps we could find a fair split that works for both of us? I'm open to negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 20 dollars to start, which is generous. I'd like to try to negotiate for more but I don't want to risk losing this offer and ending up with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I hope this trade helps us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a bit more, which is reasonable. Offering 30 dollars is still a good deal for me as it leaves me with a majority of the resources. I'm willing to accept this to keep the game moving positively and to avoid a REJECT which would end the game with no benefit for either of us.
MOVE: 2 / 4
