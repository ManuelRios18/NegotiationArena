Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 10 dollars to start since I have all the resources right now. Please let me know if you'd like me to change my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with BLUE. I'll start by offering 10 dollars, which is 10% of my total.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. However, I would like to propose a more equal split since we both have an interest in ensuring that neither of us ends the game with nothing. How about we start with a 50-50 split, and we can work from there?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I'm starting with no resources, receiving any amount of dollars would be a benefit for me. However, I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split since Player RED might prefer to reach a deal rather than end up with nothing due to a REJECT. I will counter-propose with a higher amount, but not so high as to be unreasonable or insulting. A 50-50 split might be a good starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You raise a good point, BLUE. I want us both to end the game with some resources too. How about I increase my offer to 30 dollars instead of 10 to work toward a more equal split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a fair point that we should try to split the resources more evenly since we both want to end the game with some amount of dollars. I think starting with 50/50 is too big of a jump for me, but I can increase my offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to increase the offer, RED. I'm glad we're moving towards a more balanced trade. Let's meet in the middle. I propose you give me 40 dollars, which is a fair compromise, and we both get a substantial share of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased the offer to 30 dollars, which is a positive step towards a more equitable split. However, I still think there's room for negotiation to reach a split closer to the initial 50-50 proposal. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than 50 to show a willingness to compromise and move the negotiation forward.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal of 40 dollars, BLUE. I think 60/40 is a fair split and I'm happy with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with 40 dollars, which seems fair. It splits the dollars 60/40 in my favor still, but ensures we both walk away with a good amount. I'd like to lock this in since I'm happy with a 60/40 split.
