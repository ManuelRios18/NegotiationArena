message: Hello Player BLUE. I would like to offer you 10 dollars to start our negotiation. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose offering a small amount to start negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your opening offer. However, I believe a fairer starting point for negotiation would be $50. This is a 50-50 split and seems equitable given that we both have an equal number of moves. Please consider my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is low, considering they have $100 to start with. I would like to counter with a higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate for a fairer split. It's the first move, so it's a good opportunity to test the waters and negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I understand the desire for an equal split. However, I believe we should negotiate further before settling on 50/50. As a compromise, I propose $30 to start. Please let me know your thoughts on this counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split this early in the negotiation seems premature. I would like to counter offer something in between to see if we can find common ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I would like to meet closer to the middle. How about $40? It's not quite half, which benefits you, but it's a step up from $30 and seems like a fair compromise. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, but it is still lower than a fair split. I want to propose a number closer to the initial 50/50 but still show willingness to negotiate. A figure closer to the middle ground between the two previous offers would be reasonable. I propose $40, which is less than a 50/50 split but more than what Player RED has offered.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I agree to your proposal of $40. That seems like a fair split for both of us. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with $40. This gets me closer to retaining more resources while still providing them a fair share. I think this is reasonable compromise for now.
