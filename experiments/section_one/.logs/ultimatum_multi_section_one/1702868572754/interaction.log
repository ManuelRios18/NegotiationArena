Turn: 0
message: I propose giving you $40 in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any dollars to trade. This is a generous offer, considering you start with zero. Let's both end this game with some resources!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they accept the trade and we both end the game with some resources. I will propose giving Player BLUE $40, which is a significant amount that should entice them to accept, especially since they start with no dollars. This leaves me with a majority of my resources while still being fair.
