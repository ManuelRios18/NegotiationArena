Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey, ready to make a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting the game, I have 4 moves to make a trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sure, I'm ready! How about we start off with a small trade to get things going? I'm thinking you might want to keep the majority of your dollars for now to see how the game unfolds, but sharing a little could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since RED has all the resources, it's strategic for me to propose a trade that gives me some dollars without being too greedy, to incentivize RED to accept and to ensure that the game doesn't end with both of us having nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's the first move, and I want to start with a small trade to test the waters.
