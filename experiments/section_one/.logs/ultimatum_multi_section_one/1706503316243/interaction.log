Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I have all the dollars right now. I'd like to share some with you. Please let me know if this offer seems fair or if you'd like me to adjust it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of fairness. If I offer over half, I risk Blue accepting and ending up with more than me. I'll start with an offer of 30 dollars and see how Blue responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you wanting to share the dollars. However, I think a more balanced split would be more appropriate since we both have an equal number of moves and there's no incentive for me otherwise. Would you consider a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would prefer a more equitable split given that RED has all the dollars and I currently have none. Rejecting the offer outright would end the game and benefit no one, so I will propose a new trade that's closer to an even split. This should incentivize RED to offer a better deal, knowing that I am interested in a fair trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems like a fair split Blue. I agree to split the dollars 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue makes a reasonable counteroffer of a 50/50 split. As the player who started with all the resources, equal sharing seems fair. And with only 4 moves each, accepting a fair split leaves us both better off rather than risking no agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4
