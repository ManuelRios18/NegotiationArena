message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair negotiation. Here is my first offer to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some dollars with BLUE to continue the negotiation. I'll start with a small offer to see how BLUE responds.
