message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you 40 dollars to start things off. This way, we both have something to gain. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources at the start of the game. It is in my best interest to make an offer that is appealing enough to Player BLUE to accept, as outright rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either player. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable share of the resources to incentivize cooperation and avoid a REJECT decision.
