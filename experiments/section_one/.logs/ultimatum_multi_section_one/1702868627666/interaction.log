Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that is beneficial to both of us. I'm willing to give you a fair share of my dollars to ensure we both end up with a good amount. Let's negotiate and make this a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade in a way that is attractive to Player BLUE to ensure cooperation and make the most of my resources. Offering a fair split may entice Player BLUE to accept a trade and avoid an immediate rejection, which would end the game with no benefit to either side. I will propose a split which gives Player BLUE some incentive to engage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer. I accept and look forward to an amicable negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars out of their 100 dollars. This seems like a fair opening offer that leaves both players with a decent amount. I don't have anything to lose by accepting this initial proposal.
