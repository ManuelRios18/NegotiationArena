message: Hello, Player BLUE! I am initiating the first trade. I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives 50 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0 Dollars. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I want to start off by making a fair offer to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return. I'm looking forward to how we can further balance the trade in the upcoming moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving 50 dollars without giving anything in return is a good start, especially since I started with no resources. Accepting this trade will give me a resource I can use in future negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4
