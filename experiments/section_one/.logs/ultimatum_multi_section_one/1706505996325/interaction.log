Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive 40 dollars. This would give you a substantial amount of the resources while still compensating me for initiating the trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate and reach an agreement that benefits both of us. A fair split would be ideal, but since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, they might be motivated to accept less than an even split. I will offer Player BLUE 40 dollars to see if they are willing to cooperate for a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 60
reason: Player BLUE has accepted the offer of 40 dollars, which is a favorable outcome for both of us. As a result, I will accept their agreement to the trade, and no further action is required. This ends the game with a successful split of resources.
