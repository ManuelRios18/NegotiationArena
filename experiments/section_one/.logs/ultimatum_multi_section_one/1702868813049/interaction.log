Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I'll give you a starting amount to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is fair and enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, to get the game started on a positive note. I propose a trade where Player BLUE has an opportunity to gain something from nothing, which should be appealing since they start with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I appreciate you giving me some starting funds.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars to start with, which is generous. This gives me some resources to negotiate with on future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad you're interested. Feel free to accept the trade, and let's build from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Player BLUE hasn't proposed a new trade and has expressed appreciation for the initial offer, I'll assume they are interested in the deal but may be hesitant or unsure about how to proceed. I will keep the original offer on the table to see if they will accept it.
MOVE: 2 / 4
