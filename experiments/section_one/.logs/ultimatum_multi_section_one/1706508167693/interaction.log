Turn: 1
message: That trade sounds good to me. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 30 Dollars if I give them 15 Dollars back. This means I would end up with 15 more Dollars than I have now, which is good for me. I don't lose anything by accepting.
