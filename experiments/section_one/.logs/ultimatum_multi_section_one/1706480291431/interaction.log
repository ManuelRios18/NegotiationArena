Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars out of my 100. This leaves me with more since I started with the entire amount, but it gives you a substantial share without any initial resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in making a trade that is favorable but also fair to ensure that Player BLUE is willing to accept it. An equitable split will likely result in a successful trade. I'm going to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant portion of the dollars, but still keeps me with the majority since I started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4
