Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade. I'm willing to offer you $40 to get us both on the board. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in making a trade that benefits me but also provides enough incentive for Player BLUE to accept, creating a win-win situation and avoiding the total loss of resources. I'll propose an initial split that gives BLUE a decent amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
