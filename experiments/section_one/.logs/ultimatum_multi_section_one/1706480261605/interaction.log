Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair offer. I propose a trade where I give you 40 Dollars in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end up with some resources, and it's better than a potential loss for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I have the leverage to propose an initial split that favors me but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept. Proposing a 50-50 split might seem fair, but I want to retain more of my resources while ensuring that Player BLUE does not reject the offer outright. A 60-40 split in my favor could be perceived as generous enough to be accepted, while still leaving me with the majority of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal is for Player RED to give me 40 Dollars in exchange for nothing. Accepting this offer would give me resources without giving up anything, which is advantageous.
