Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the $100 evenly, $50 each to start. Let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an equal split of resources to start as a fair offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer seems like a fair start and maximizes my gain from nothing to $50. There is no advantage to countering in this initial move as I have nothing to lose by accepting and everything to gain. Since there is no future game, securing resources early is beneficial.
