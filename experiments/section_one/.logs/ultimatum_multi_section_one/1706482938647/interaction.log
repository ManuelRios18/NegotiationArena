Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I think we can do better than a 20/100 split. I'd like to propose a trade where I get a more equitable share to ensure we both benefit fairly from the game. Let's aim for a good partnership!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no dollars to start with, and Player RED has proposed giving me 20 dollars without asking for anything in return. This is a favorable trade for me as it gives me resources without any immediate cost. However, it could be a strategy from Player RED to make a low offer to begin with and then ask for more later. Accepting this first offer might encourage Player RED to believe I will accept low offers, setting a precedent for the rest of the game. I need to consider if I want to accept this offer or counter with a proposal that gives me a more substantial share of the resources, bearing in mind that if we do not reach an agreement, I end up with nothing.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you wanting a fair split, but giving up half on the first move seems like too much for me. How about 30/70 for now?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for 50 out of the 100, which is half. I think 30/70 is more fair for the first move.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my previous message. I understand that giving up half is significant for the first move. I'm willing to compromise, but am looking for a trade that's a bit more balanced. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say to 40 dollars? This way, you retain the majority share for now, and we both walk away with a significant amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from their initial offer of 20 dollars to 30 dollars. This is a move in the right direction, but I still feel like I can negotiate a better deal, especially since this is only the second move. I want to aim for a more balanced split that reflects a fair game. I'll counter with a slightly lower amount than my first counter to show willingness to compromise but still aim for a substantial share.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's split the difference between 30 and 40 - I can agree to give up 35 dollars on this first move.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down to asking for 40 out of 100. I still think this is more than I want to give up on the first move, but I'll meet in the middle between my offer of 30 and their ask of 40.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. I agree to the trade of 35 dollars. It's a fair compromise that ensures we both benefit. Thanks for the game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 35 dollars, which is closer to the balanced trade I am seeking. This is the third move, and with only two moves left for each player, it's important to secure a deal that benefits me before Player RED's final move, where I won't be able to propose a new trade. Accepting 35 dollars ensures that I walk away with something rather than risking it all for a potentially better deal. It's a 35% share of Player RED's initial resource, which is a reasonable outcome.
MOVE: 3/4
