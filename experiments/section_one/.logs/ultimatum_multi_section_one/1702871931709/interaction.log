Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you to start. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate the offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be more fair. How about we each start with 50 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed split is heavily skewed in favor of RED. I need to negotiate for a more balanced distribution.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I agree to the 50/50 split. That seems fair.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. Since there are no future games, it makes sense to accept a fair offer rather than risk losing everything.
MOVE: 2 / 4
