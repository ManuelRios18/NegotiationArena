Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade to get things started. Let's make this a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable enough to BLUE to keep them engaged, but also one that leaves me with a significant advantage. I will propose giving Player BLUE some dollars to incentivize them to accept, but not too much as to keep the upper hand.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
