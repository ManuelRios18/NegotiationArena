Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both can benefit equally from the game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal to entice Player BLUE to engage positively. I will propose a 50-50 split. This seems fair as we both have the same number of moves and it can be seen as a cooperation incentive.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer, I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars out of the 100 dollars they have. This seems like a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. I don't have a reason to reject or counter offer at this point.
MOVE: 1 / 4
