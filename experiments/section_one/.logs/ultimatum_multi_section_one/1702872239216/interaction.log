Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Blue, I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you to start. Let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiations and see how Blue responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems like a fair opening offer to me. I accept and look forward to seeing where the negotiations go from here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 20 dollars out of the total 100. That seems fair to start since they have all the dollars initially. I will accept this offer for now and see if I can negotiate more on future turns.
