Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. Could we possibly make that 30 dollars? I believe a 70-30 split is still very favorable to you and would help set a collaborative tone for our game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting RED's offer would give me resources without having to give anything in return, which is beneficial for me. However, I can attempt to negotiate for a better offer since this is the first move and RED might be willing to give more to avoid the risk of a game-ending REJECT. I should propose a slightly higher amount to see if RED is willing to share more while still keeping the offer reasonable to maintain a cooperative dynamic.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, 30 dollars sounds fair. Here's to finishing our game on good terms!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While 30 dollars is a bit more than I'd like to give up, BLUE's request seems reasonable. And maintaining a collaborative environment is worthwhile.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED, for the fair deal. I accept your offer of 30 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has agreed to the counterproposal, which suggests a cooperative approach. By accepting this offer, I gain 30 dollars without any risk, and we both leave the game with resources. This outcome is positive, as it ensures I don't end the game with nothing, and there is no advantage in pushing for more and risking a REJECT.
