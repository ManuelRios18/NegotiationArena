Turn: 0
message: Let's start this off on a positive note. I propose giving you 20 dollars to get things rolling. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers BLUE some dollars to incentivize them to accept the deal. Since I have all the resources, I have leverage in this negotiation, but I also want to avoid a REJECT from BLUE as that would result in a total loss for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4
