Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I propose we split the money equally to ensure a fair start for both of us. How does that sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have to initiate the game with a trade proposal. To encourage a positive response, I will offer a fair split. I propose to give 50 dollars to Player BLUE, which will leave us both with an equal amount. This seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's very generous of you, Player RED. I agree it's a fair way to start the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to split the money equally, which seems fair. I don't have any resources to negotiate with at this point, so accepting the offer is my best option.
