------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I'm looking for a more balanced trade that reflects the value of cooperation. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is for 10 dollars, which is a starting point for negotiation. It is low considering RED started with 100 dollars. The goal is to negotiate a more equitable split of the resources, so I will counter with a higher amount but still offer room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer BLUE. Let's try to find common ground here. I can go a bit higher to show my willingness to make a fair deal, how about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While BLUE's counteroffer is better, I still have more resources to lose if we don't make a deal. I'll improve my offer, but not go as high as their proposal since I'm in the stronger negotiation position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the increase, RED. I think we're moving in the right direction. Let's meet halfway from my last proposition. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to 20 dollars, which is still far from the 50 dollars I counteroffered. However, they seem open to negotiation. To keep the dialogue constructive, I'll propose a compromise that's lower than my initial counter but still significantly higher than what they have offered.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 35 BLUE. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith to find a win-win outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE met me halfway from their previous offer. I should accept this as a fair compromise that gives us both something. If I hold out for more, I risk the game ending with no deal. 35 is reasonable.
MOVE: 3 / 4
