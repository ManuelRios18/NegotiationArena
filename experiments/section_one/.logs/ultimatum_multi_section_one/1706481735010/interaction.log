message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade proposal. I offer to give you 40 Dollars in exchange for an item of your choice. Feel free to counter-offer if you have a different trade in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the straightforward proposal, but I was wondering if you could increase the amount to 50 Dollars. It would give me a better position to negotiate in the subsequent moves. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I start with no resources, any positive amount of dollars would be beneficial to me. Accepting the offer would provide me with resources that I could potentially use in future negotiations. However, I could also attempt to negotiate for a higher amount since RED might be willing to offer more to ensure a successful trade. Proposing a counter-offer could potentially lead to a better outcome for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3

message: Great, I accept your counter-offer of 50 Dollars. Looking forward to the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has suggested a counter-offer of 50 Dollars, which seems reasonable. I will accept this proposal to proceed.
