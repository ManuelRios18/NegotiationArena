Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Blue, let's have a fair game. Here is my opening offer to split the resources evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of fairness. If I offer half, that seems reasonably fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4
