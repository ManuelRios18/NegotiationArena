Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose an equal split of the dollars I have. This way, we both walk away with something substantial. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts and I'm in a position with all the resources, my strategy is to offer an initial fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and make the game beneficial for both. Offering too little might result in a REJECT, ending the game with no gain for anyone. I will propose a simple split down the middle to show good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4
