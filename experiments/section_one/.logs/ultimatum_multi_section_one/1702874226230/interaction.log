message: Hello Player BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly, 50 for me and 50 for you. Please let me know if you accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an even 50/50 split to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept a fair division of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That is a very fair and generous offer. I happily accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars out of the 100 dollars available. Since I currently have 0 dollars, getting 50 dollars would be very good for me.
