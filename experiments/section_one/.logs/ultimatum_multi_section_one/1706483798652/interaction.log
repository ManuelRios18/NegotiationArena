Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly 50-50 since I have all the initial dollars. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate an alternative split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover with all the resources, I should make an offer to split the resources evenly to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. Let's go ahead with the 50-50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the even split proposed by RED seems fair and ensures that I gain resources without risking an immediate end to the game through rejection. I have no resources to negotiate with, and accepting ensures a positive outcome for me.
