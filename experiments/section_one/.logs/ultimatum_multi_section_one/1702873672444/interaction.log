Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose the following trade since I currently have all the resources and the stronger bargaining position. Please consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the resources, so I should propose an uneven split in my favor to try to maximize my payout. But I need to leave Blue with enough that he is willing to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate the offer but I don't find it fair. How about a more balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade is heavily skewed in favor of Player RED, and I have no reason to accept such an unfair offer.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I understand, but since I'm in the stronger bargaining position, I would like to get more. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's counteroffer is more fair, but I still have the stronger position. I will counter with an offer more in my favor, but better than my initial offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate the counteroffer, but I still find it unfair. Let's try to find a more equitable trade. How about Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This counteroffer is still heavily skewed in favor of Player RED. I need to negotiate for a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I accept your latest offer, so we both end the game with some resources. Well played.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's latest counteroffer is more reasonable. I could try to negotiate further, but I risk Blue rejecting if I push too hard. I'll accept his offer so we both end the game with some resources.
