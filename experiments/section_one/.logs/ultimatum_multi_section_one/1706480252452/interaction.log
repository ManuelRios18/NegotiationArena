Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a significant amount, and it feels fair. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is fair and incentivizes Player BLUE to cooperate rather than end the game early. Offering a substantial sum might encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they start with no dollars. I will suggest a 50-50 split because it's a simple, equal share that's easy to understand and typically considered fair in many negotiation contexts.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
