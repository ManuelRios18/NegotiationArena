message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to offer an equal split of the resources. This way we both can benefit fairly from the game. What do you think about a 50-50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am considering making an initial fair offer to Player BLUE to foster cooperation and establish trust. In a one-shot game, there are no future consequences for betrayal, so it's important to make an offer that is attractive to Player BLUE to incentivize acceptance. I will propose a 50-50 split to show good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: That's a very fair offer, I agree to split the resources 50-50. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50-50 split seems fair. I don't have any resources to contribute, so accepting this offer allows me to get some resources.
