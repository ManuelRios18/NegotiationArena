message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade proposal. I offer to give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your initial offer, but unfortunately, I don't have any dollars to trade. How about you give me a starting amount so we can proceed with more interesting trades? I'm open to fair negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial trade as it clearly doesn't benefit me because I have no dollars to trade. Proposing a new trade that would allow me to start with some dollars without having to give anything in return, which seems like a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
