Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose to give you 40 dollars, which is a substantial amount to start off with, without any contribution from your side. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first move, I'll propose a trade that is generous enough to incentivize Player BLUE to engage but also retains the majority of my resources. A split that is too uneven may result in rejection and loss of all resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1

newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: It's the first move, and Player RED is offering me a substantial amount without any contribution from my side. Accepting this offer would give me a good start.
