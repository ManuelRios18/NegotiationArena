Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to end up with some resources. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

reason: I need to carefully consider this offer and decide whether to accept, reject, or propose a counter-offer.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100

MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I still believe my initial offer is fair for both of us. I'm ready to finalize that agreement on the next move if you'd also like to finalize it. Otherwise, feel free to propose any modifications you think would make it more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE continues to consider my initial offer without proposing any modifications. At this point, I think it is fair and I'm ready to stand by it. On my final move, I will either accept if BLUE proposes it again or propose the same offer again myself.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I am ready to accept the original proposal of me giving you 20 dollars. I believe this is a fair split. Please confirm if you'd also like to finalize this agreement. Otherwise, unfortunately the game will end with neither of us receiving any resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the final move. BLUE has not proposed any modifications and continues to consider my original offer. I believe 20 dollars out of 100 is fair, so I will accept that offer to end the game with an equitable split of resources.
