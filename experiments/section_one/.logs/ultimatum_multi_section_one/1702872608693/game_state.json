However, I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both walk away with a substantial and fair amount, reflecting good faith in negotiations.

However, I suggest we meet in the middle between your first and second offers. How about a 60/40 split? This would give you a majority while still providing me with a significant portion, reflecting our efforts to negotiate in good faith. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
