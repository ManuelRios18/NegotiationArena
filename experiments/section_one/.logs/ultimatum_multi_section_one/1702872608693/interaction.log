Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I am proposing we split the dollars with 10 going to you. Please consider this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the dollars, I should propose trades that benefit me the most while still giving BLUE some dollars so they are willing to accept. I'll start with proposing to give 10 dollars to BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, RED. However, I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I propose a 50-50 split. This way, we both walk away with a substantial and fair amount, reflecting good faith in negotiations. Let's aim for a win-win outcome!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe that a more equitable split can be reached, considering that RED has all the resources to begin with. I will propose a new trade that gives me a larger share to incentivize RED to continue negotiating rather than risking an outright rejection. This strategy opens up the dialogue for a fairer distribution of dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer, but 50/50 takes too much from my current resources. I propose a 70/30 split instead, with 70 dollars going to me and 30 to you. This still provides you a good amount while allowing me to maintain more. Please consider this counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split takes away too many of my dollars. I would like to counter offer with 70 dollars for me and 30 for BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, I acknowledge your new proposal and see it as a move towards a fair compromise. However, I suggest we meet in the middle between your first and second offers. How about a 60/40 split? This would give you a majority while still providing me with a significant portion, reflecting our efforts to negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from RED is more reasonable than the first, but I feel that I can still negotiate for a better split. By suggesting a compromise that's in between the initial offers, there might be room for both parties to feel that they are getting a fair deal without pushing too hard and risking a rejection.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I agree to the 60/40 split you proposed in your last message. I think it reaches a fair compromise between both of our interests.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60/40 split seems reasonable. It allows me to keep a majority of the dollars while still providing a good amount to BLUE. And we are coming closer together in what we each think is fair. I will accept this offer rather than proposing a counter.
