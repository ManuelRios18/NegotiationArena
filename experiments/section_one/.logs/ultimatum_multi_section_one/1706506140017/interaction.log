Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As a sign of good faith and to start our negotiations, I propose a trade where you receive a fair amount of dollars to balance our resources. This is the beginning of our negotiation, so I'm open to your counter-proposals as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the resources advantage and I am initiating the first move. I want to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to engage, but still leaves me with a majority share of the resources. Offering a split that is not 50/50 could suggest I value future cooperation, while also asserting a position of strength.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate fairly. As a counter-proposal, could you consider 50 dollars to balance our starting resources more evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate Player RED's offer of 40 dollars as a sign of good faith to start negotiations. While it's a fair opening offer, I think 50 dollars would be more equitable to balance our resources, since Player RED started with 100 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a more balanced share. I'm willing to increase my offer, but 50 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with for our first trade. Let's meet in the middle from our two offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 50 dollars. While this is a more equal split, it is still within a reasonable range for me to maintain a resource advantage. By agreeing to this trade, I can foster a cooperative relationship and possibly avoid a game-ending rejection. I must consider, however, that Player BLUE cannot propose on their final move, so I should aim to conclude negotiations before then.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your counter-proposal of 45 dollars. Thank you for negotiating in good faith to find a reasonable compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with 45 dollars, meeting in the middle between our initial proposals. This seems like a reasonable compromise to balance the resources more evenly while still allowing Player RED to retain a slight advantage. I will accept the offer as a sign of good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4
