message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this a win-win situation. I propose a trade that gives you a starting capital, and we can both benefit from this game. I'm offering you $20 to get things rolling. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to set the tone for the negotiation. I will start with a trade proposal that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage and continue the game, while also retaining a majority of the resources for myself. By offering a reasonable, but advantageous trade for myself, I aim to build trust and encourage cooperation.
