Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to try to find a fair split for both of us. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. It's a good starting point. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 40 dollars seems like a generous starting point. It is beneficial for me to accept this offer as it provides me with resources that I initially do not have. However, it might be worth it to negotiate for a slightly better deal, as Player RED might be willing to give up more to avoid a total loss. It's the first move, and negotiation is expected; hence, I will propose a counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair. I accept your proposal and we can end the game with an equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer of 50 is reasonable. Since I have more moves left and more to lose if the game ends with no agreement, I will accept their offer in the interests of finding a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 4
