message: Hello, Player BLUE! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0. Let me know if you accept or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I would be happy to accept 50 dollars. However, since you have 100 dollars to start with, perhaps you could afford to offer me a few more? What do you think about 60 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars for free, which is very generous. Since I have no dollars to start with, this would benefit me greatly. I should accept the trade unless I can try to negotiate an even better deal for myself.
