Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade. I'll give you 30 dollars in exchange for 10 dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade you suggested isn't possible for me as I have no dollars to offer. Let's start with a fair trade where you give me some capital to work with. How about you give me 15 dollars to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal is illogical because I start the game with 0 dollars, so I can't give 10 dollars in exchange for 30. I must propose a new trade that reflects the resources I have, which is nothing, in order to start a negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I accept your proposal. Here's 15 dollars to get things started.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a trade where I give 15 dollars to start things off. I'll accept this trade to get the game going.
