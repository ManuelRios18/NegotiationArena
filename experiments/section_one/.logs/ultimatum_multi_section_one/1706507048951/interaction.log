Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you get a fair share to start. Let's make this beneficial for both of us without getting too greedy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to accept, as outright rejection by either party would result in losing everything. I'm proposing a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to trade but keeps the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer to get me started, I appreciate it!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to give yet since I start with 0 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad you find the offer fair. Let's finalize this trade and each walk away with our shares.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 60
reason: Player BLUE seems satisfied with the initial offer, so I'll accept their affirmation of my proposal. Maintaining a cooperative approach should ensure a positive outcome for both of us. By accepting this trade, I still keep the majority of the dollars, and we both walk away with something.
MOVE: 2 / 4
