message: That offer sounds good to me. Since I have no Dollars right now, gaining 20 would be very helpful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 30 Dollars if I give them 10 Dollars. Since I currently have 0 Dollars, this would give me a net gain of 20 Dollars, which is beneficial for me.
