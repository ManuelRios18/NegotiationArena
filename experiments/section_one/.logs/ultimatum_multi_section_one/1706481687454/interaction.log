message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept your trade of 20 dollars for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I have no dollars and Player RED is offering to give me 20 dollars for nothing in return, it's a good deal for me. Accepting the offer will provide me with resources that I can potentially use in future trades.
