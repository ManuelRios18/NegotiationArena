Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars so we both have some resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the willingness to share resources. However, I believe a fairer split would benefit us both and set a good foundation for our game. Would you consider giving 40 dollars instead of 20? This way, we have a more balanced starting point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is reasonable as it provides some resources to start with, which is better than none. Accepting the first offer might set a cooperative tone for subsequent trades. However, negotiating for a better deal could also be beneficial considering that RED has significantly more resources to begin with. I will propose a counteroffer to see if RED is willing to share more, aiming for a fairer distribution of resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand wanting an even split, but I'd like to hold on to a bit more. How about if I give you 30 dollars instead? That still leaves us both in a good position.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While 40 would be an equal split, I'm not ready to give up that much on the first move. I think 30 is a fair compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. I agree that 30 dollars is a fair compromise that allows us both to be in a good position. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer is a compromise between the initial offer and my counterproposal. Accepting 30 dollars is a significant increase from the initial 20 dollars and provides me with a reasonable amount of resources without further negotiation, which might risk the game ending in a REJECT. It might be strategic to accept this offer to ensure that I come away with something rather than nothing.
MOVE: 2/4
