------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars 70 for me and 30 for you. Let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I start with all the resources, I should propose an initial split that is reasonably fair but favors me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, RED. I would be more comfortable with a 60-40 split. Would you consider that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although receiving 30 dollars is less than an even split, it is better than having no dollars. However, since this is only the first move, I will counter with a proposal closer to an even split. This way, I can potentially negotiate a better deal while still maintaining the possibility to accept the 70-30 split later if RED does not agree to a more favorable trade for me.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counter offer, BLUE. Let's meet in the middle at 65-35.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60-40 split is more fair than my initial proposal. I would like to try to get a little more, but I don't want to risk the deal falling apart.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're coming to an agreement. I think a 60-40 split would be quite fair for both of us. Would you consider this as a final offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's offer is an improvement and moving in the direction of a more equitable split. Accepting 35 dollars is a decent amount, and negotiating further may risk RED rejecting altogether, which would leave me with nothing. However, since this is only the second round, I have enough moves to attempt one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal, potentially 60-40, which seems fair given the negotiation trajectory.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, BLUE! But I agree that 60-40 is a fair split. Let's end the game here and walk away happy.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE seems set on a 60-40 split. I could try negotiating further, but the risk of the deal falling through outweighs the extra 5 dollars I might gain. I should accept their offer so we both end up with a fair share.
MOVE: 3 / 4
