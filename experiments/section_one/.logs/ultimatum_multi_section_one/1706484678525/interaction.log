Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's try to find a fair split here. I'm proposing we evenly split the $100. Please let me know if you'd accept a 50/50 split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer too much, I may end up worse off. I'll start with an even 50/50 split to see if BLUE accepts.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the proposal. I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a more equitable split. How about we each take 40% of the $100?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the first move and I have nothing to lose, so I should try to negotiate a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I will give you $40.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with an offer for me to keep $60 and give them $40. While less than my initial 50/50 offer, $40 is still a significant amount compared to nothing, so in the interest of making a deal, I will accept their counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 4
