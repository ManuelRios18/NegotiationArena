Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose an equal split of my dollars to ensure we both benefit. What are your thoughts on splitting the dollars 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to start with a generous offer to encourage cooperation from Player BLUE and to set a positive tone for the negotiation. A 50/50 split is fair and equitable and may be perceived as a good starting point for Player BLUE to engage in the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. Thank you for the fair offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair since we both start with nothing. I don't have a counteroffer that would benefit us both more at this time.
MOVE: 1 / 4
