Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade proposal. How about I give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a trade to start the game and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I can't accept that trade as I don't have any dollars to give. How about you give me 25 Dollars to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no dollars to trade, so the initial proposal from RED is not feasible. I will propose a new trade that allows me to gain some dollars without any investment, which would be beneficial for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I accept the trade proposal. 25 Dollars for me and 0 for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE counter-offered with a proposal. I'm considering accepting it to make progress in the game.
