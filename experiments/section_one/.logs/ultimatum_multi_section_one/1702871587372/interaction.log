message: Hello BLUE. I propose the following trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate the proposal, but I believe we can come up with a trade that benefits both of us. How about this: I give you 0 Dollars in exchange for 30 Dollars from you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I would receive nothing in return. I should propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I understand you want more resources, but giving up 30 is too high for me. How about I give you 15 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks me to give up too much. I will counter with a smaller amount that is still beneficial for both sides.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I agree to the proposed trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The new proposed trade is more reasonable, as I would receive 15 dollars in return. This is a step in the right direction.
