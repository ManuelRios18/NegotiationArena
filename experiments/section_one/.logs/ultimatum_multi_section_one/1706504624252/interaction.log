Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I appreciate the gesture to start things positively. I would like to propose a counteroffer that might reflect a more balanced sharing of the resources, considering the initial disparity. How about we adjust the trade to provide a bit more balance?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since this is the beginning of the negotiation and RED is offering 20 dollars without asking for anything in return, accepting this offer could set a collaborative tone for the rest of the game. However, I should aim to negotiate for a higher amount since RED has all the resources. It is in my interest to propose a counteroffer that is fair but also maximizes my gain.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, BLUE. Let's meet in the middle at $30.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for more than I originally offered. I would like to find a fair middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my counteroffer, RED. I understand the need to find a middle ground. However, I still believe that a slightly more equitable distribution is possible. Would you be willing to consider a final adjustment?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a concession from the initial offer, which is a good sign of willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still below the 50% mark of the total resources. A further negotiation could potentially increase the amount I receive. On the other hand, pushing too hard might lead to a breakdown in negotiations. Since there are only four moves for each of us, and considering the risk of RED rejecting a counteroffer, it might be wise to either accept this offer or make one final counteroffer that is closer to RED's last proposal but still advantageous to me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your latest offer of $40, BLUE. Well played in negotiating a fair split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come back with a very reasonable counteroffer. At this point, I think accepting their offer of $40 is a fair split that allows us both to end the game with some resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4
