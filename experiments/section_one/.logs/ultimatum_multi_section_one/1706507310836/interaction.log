message: I propose to give you 30 dollars for no cost to get you started. This should be a great deal for you since you start with no money. Let's keep the game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with dollars in my possession. My strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept, keeping the game alive and ensuring I come out ahead. I'm proposing to give Player BLUE 30 dollars which is a significant amount and should tempt Player BLUE to accept the trade.
