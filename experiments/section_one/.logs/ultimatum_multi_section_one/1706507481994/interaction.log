Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. How about I give you $40 to establish trust and cooperation? We can negotiate further in the next moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm initiating the first move. I want to make an enticing offer to Player BLUE to foster cooperation and avoid an immediate rejection which would end the game with no benefit to either player. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, but still keeps the majority for myself as an incentive for further negotiation.
