message: Hello BLUE, I think a fair proposal is for us to split the dollars equally 50/50. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal 50/50 split since this seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree that a 50/50 split is fair and I'm happy to accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from RED to split the money 50/50 seems fair and beneficial for both parties. It's a strong starting proposal that ensures we both walk away with equal value, which is a solid foundation for cooperative gameplay. Accepting this offer is in my best interest since I start with no dollars and this guarantees a positive outcome for me.
