Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair split of our resources. I am offering you 50 dollars, which leaves us both with equal amounts. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I will propose a trade that offers a split of the dollars. Since there is no advantage to me in hoarding all the resources, and since the game ends with no future games, a fair split would encourage cooperation and potentially lead to an agreement that benefits both players. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars, which is a fair and equal split. This is a starting proposal and can be negotiated in further moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to start negotiations with your proposed 50/50 split. That seems fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think starting with an even split is reasonable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we agree on the fairness of a 50/50 split. I accept your agreement to the proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Player BLUE has agreed that a 50/50 split seems fair, I will accept this proposal to secure a cooperative outcome for both of us. This acceptance will lead to an immediate end to the game with both players benefitting equally, which is a positive and fair result.
