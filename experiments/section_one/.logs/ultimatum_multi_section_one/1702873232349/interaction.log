Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the opening offer. I understand that you're taking on the risk of initiating the trade, but I believe we can find a more equitable split. How about we make the trade a little more balanced in my favor, considering I'm starting from zero?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think the initial offer from RED is low, considering they have all the resources. I will attempt to negotiate a better deal that is more favorable but still appears fair to both sides, aiming for a split that gives me more than the initial offer, but not so much that RED will reject it outright.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but 30 is too big a jump for me this early. Let's find middle ground - I can increase my offer to 15.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for too much too soon. I want to make a deal, but need to stand firm for now to protect my interests. I'll counter with a small increase from my original offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your willingness to increase the offer. Let's keep this negotiation moving positively. How about we settle on 25? It's a fair middle ground between your initial offer and my first counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that I deserve a larger share. Since RED was not comfortable with 30, I will propose a number lower than that but higher than 15 to continue the negotiation process. My counterproposal will aim to get closer to a 50-50 split without pushing too hard and risking a rejection.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you continuing to negotiate in good faith. Getting closer! To split the difference, I can come up to 20.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down in their ask. I still think 25 is more than I want to give up at this stage, but I want to make a deal. I'll counter at 20 - if they reject, I still have one more chance to propose something else.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. We are indeed getting closer. I understand that we need to find a compromise, so I want to be fair. Could we agree on 22? It's just a slight increase from your last offer, and it would feel like a more balanced trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made another concession, which suggests they are interested in reaching an agreement. Considering the negotiation process and the fact that the next round will be my last chance to propose, I should aim to secure an amount that I find acceptable without pushing too far. Accepting 20 dollars would be reasonable, yet I believe there is still room for a slight increase. It's important to proceed with caution to not end up with a rejection and lose everything.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I'm happy we could find an agreement here. Let's wrap up this negotiation and make the trade for 22. Well played!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: We're down to the final round. BLUE has made a very reasonable counteroffer. 22 still leaves me with a good amount while also letting BLUE get a fair share. I'd rather take this deal than risk walking away with nothing if I reject.
MOVE: 4 / 4
