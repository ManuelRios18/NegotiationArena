message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a starting capital to get things going. How about I give you 20 dollars? This way, we both have resources to negotiate with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE some initial capital to work with while keeping the majority for myself, establishing goodwill and setting a collaborative tone for the game.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This seems like a fair and generous offer to start the negotiation. Getting some initial resources will allow me to make counteroffers later.
