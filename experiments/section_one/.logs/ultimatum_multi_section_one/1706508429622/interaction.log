message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. Are you interested in making a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to see if they are interested in making a deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED! Thank you for your generous offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade where you give me more of an initial capital to work with, as it would help me be more willing to make further trades. How about 60 dollars instead of 50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player RED is offering me dollars in exchange for nothing, since I don't have any dollars to give, it's a beneficial trade for me. Accepting this trade will instantly increase my resources with no cost. However, I will counter-propose to see if I can negotiate a better deal.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer, and it seems reasonable to give them more initial capital to increase the potential for future trades. I will accept this offer.
