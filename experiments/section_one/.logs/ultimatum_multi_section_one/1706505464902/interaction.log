message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor since I started with all of it. Let me know if you have any other proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up with something, but keep most for myself.
