message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. How about I give you 40 dollars to help you get going? It's a good amount that can benefit you, and we can both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, while still keeping a decent amount of resources for myself. I will start with a proposal that gives Player BLUE a significant amount, but still keeps the majority for myself. This opening offer can also serve as a test to gauge Player BLUE's reaction and willingness to trade.
