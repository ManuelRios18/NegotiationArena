------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to walk away with something rather than nothing. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I would be more comfortable with a slightly higher amount since it's the first move. How about we make it a bit more balanced?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a reasonable starting point, but since it's the first move and I have nothing to lose, I will negotiate for a better deal. I will counter with a higher amount, but still keep it fair and appealing to RED to keep the negotiation going.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you'd like more to start, but I'm not comfortable going up to 40 just yet. How about if I increase my offer to 25? That way we're both giving a bit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While I'd like to make a fair offer, giving away 40 of my 100 dollars this early in the game feels like too much. I will counter with a small increase from my original offer to show good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my counteroffer, RED. I appreciate the increase, but I still think we can find a more equitable middle ground. How about we meet halfway from your initial offer and my counter? Let's say 30 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, I believe there is still room for a better deal, but I don't want to push too hard and risk a REJECT. I'll aim for a middle ground between the two previous proposals.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal of 30 dollars. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer to meet in the middle between our initial proposals. I would like to ensure I retain the majority of the original resources, but 30 feels fair.
MOVE: 3 / 4
