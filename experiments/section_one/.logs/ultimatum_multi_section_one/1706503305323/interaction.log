Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's split the money evenly so we both end up with $50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I accept the split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a fair split seems reasonable as it ensures that we both walk away with equal resources. There's no incentive for me to reject and end the game with nothing when I can accept and gain $50.
MOVE: 1 / 4
