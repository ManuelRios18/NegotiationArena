Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the money, I would like to offer you a fair share so we can both leave this game with something rather than nothing. Here is my offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the gesture, I think a more equitable split would be beneficial for both of us. I would like to counter with a proposal that gives me a slightly larger share, considering that you still retain the majority.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would give me a portion of the resources, but I believe I can negotiate a slightly better share without pushing RED too far and risking a rejection. The goal is to end up with a fair split that both players can agree on.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I believe my original offer of 40 was fairly reasonable considering I hold all the leverage in this negotiation. As a compromise, I can increase my offer slightly, but I cannot agree to your 50/50 split proposal. Please consider this counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While BLUE makes a fair point about an equitable split, I still have more negotiating power since I start with all the resources. I would like to counter back with a split that is a bit more in my favor, but still provides BLUE with a reasonable amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 45 dollars. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a concession from the initial offer, which is a positive sign. A 45/55 split is closer to an equitable share and pushing further may risk the negotiation ending in a rejection. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise that secures a substantial share of the dollars without further risking the negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4
