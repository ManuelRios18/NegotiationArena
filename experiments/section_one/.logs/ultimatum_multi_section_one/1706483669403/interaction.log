Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose giving a small amount to start negotiation and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, while I appreciate your offer, 20 dollars seems disproportionately small compared to the 80 you would keep. Could you consider increasing my portion to 30 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 20 dollars out of the total 100 dollars. This seems like a small portion compared to what RED would keep. I will counter offer to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, you make a fair point. I can increase my offer to 25 dollars for you. Does that work?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like to continue negotiating in good faith by meeting BLUE in the middle. This way we both end up with something.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you increasing your offer. Getting 25 out of 100 total dollars is better, but still seems like a small portion compared to the 75 you would retain. Could you consider 30 dollars for me instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 25 dollars for me. This is better but still seems disproportionate compared to the 75 they would keep. I will counter offer one more time to try and get more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand 30 is more reasonable for you. Let's split it 50/50 to be fair since we both want a good outcome. Does 50 dollars each work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like to continue negotiating reasonably and propose a fair split. If we cannot agree, we will both lose our resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I agree that splitting 50/50 is a fair outcome. I accept your proposal to split the dollars equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed splitting the dollars 50/50 which seems fair. Since this is my best offer so far, I will accept it.
