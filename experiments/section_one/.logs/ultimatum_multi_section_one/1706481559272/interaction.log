message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose that I give you $40, so we both can walk away with a significant amount. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting resources, but I need to propose a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but considering I am in the power position, I can propose a slightly skewed split in my favor that Player BLUE might still accept. I'll propose a 60-40 split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer, I accept. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I should accept any offer that gives me a fair share. $40 out of the total $100 seems reasonable.
