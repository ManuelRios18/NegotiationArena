Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars to start. This way, we both have something to work with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to accept but still allows me to retain a significant portion of my resources. This first move should open negotiations and set the tone for a cooperative game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept. Now we both have some resources to work with. Let's continue negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I will accept Player RED's generous offer to give me 40 dollars. This puts me in a better position to negotiate further.
