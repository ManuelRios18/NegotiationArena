Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's have a fair game. I propose we split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an even split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED seems reasonable as it gives me resources I didn't have before. It's a fair starting point. Rejecting would end the game immediately with no benefit to me. Proposing a new trade could be seen as greedy or could provoke RED to end the game, which would leave me with nothing. Accepting this trade guarantees a gain, which is a rational choice.
