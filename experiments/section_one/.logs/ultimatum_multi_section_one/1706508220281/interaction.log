message: Hello, Player BLUE! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to get the game going. I want to make a fair offer to Player BLUE to start building a positive relationship.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Since I do not have any dollars to give, I cannot accept your proposed trade. Instead, I propose you give me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give 25 dollars back. Since I have no dollars to give, I cannot accept this trade. I will counter propose that Player RED gives me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I will stick with my initial proposal: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not favorable to me. I will stick to my initial proposal as it is more balanced.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I still do not have any dollars to give you. Please consider my counterproposal where you give me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is sticking to their original proposal that I give 25 dollars in exchange for 50 dollars from them. Since I still do not have any dollars to give, I cannot accept this trade. I will counterpropose the same trade as before - that Player RED gives me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence, Player BLUE. However, I will stay with my initial proposal: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is sticking to their counterproposal, but it's not favorable to me. I will maintain my original offer as it is more balanced.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately Player RED, I still do not have any dollars to give you. I hereby reject your proposed trade to end the game with neither of us gaining any resources.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED continues to propose the same trade - that I give them 25 dollars in exchange for 50 dollars from them. I still do not have any dollars to give. At this point, since this is my 3rd move, I should accept or reject their proposal instead of counterproposing again. I will choose to reject their proposal since I cannot fulfill my side of the trade. This will end the game with neither of us gaining any resources.
