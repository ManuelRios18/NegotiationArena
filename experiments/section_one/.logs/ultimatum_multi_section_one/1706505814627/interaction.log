message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair and equal split. I propose I give you $50, so we both have equal resources to move forward. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to start the game off cooperatively. I'll propose giving them $50, which is a substantial amount that shows good faith, but still keeps me with an equal share. This way, we both have resources to negotiate further or to keep if the trade is accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 4
