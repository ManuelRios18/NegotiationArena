Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly to start in a fair manner. This can set us up to both potentially gain resources in the future rather than me taking everything and leaving you with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial fair trade to establish trust and set the stage for potential future mutually beneficial trades.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer. I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is proposing an even split of the dollars to start off, which seems fair. Since I currently have no resources, getting 50 dollars would be beneficial for me.
