Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I propose we split the resources so we both end up with some.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to Blue so we can both end the game with some resources rather than risking one of us rejecting and losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi, I understand your proposal, but I don't have any resources to give at the moment. I propose a new trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources yet, so I cannot accept the proposal. I need to propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I think 40 is more fair since I began with everything. Let's meet in the middle at 35.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue proposed giving me 30 instead of 40. I think it's fair that I keep more since I started with all the resources, so I will counter offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I still don't have any resources to give, so I cannot accept the proposal. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Okay, I accept your proposal of 30.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
