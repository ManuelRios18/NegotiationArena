message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing to get things started on a positive note. This way, we both can end up with resources at the end of the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 100 dollars to begin with. My goal is to propose a trade that is favorable but not too unfair to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and a positive outcome for both parties. By offering a reasonable trade, I can set a cooperative tone for the game. I will propose that Player BLUE gets 40 dollars, which gives them a significant amount of resources while I still retain the majority.
