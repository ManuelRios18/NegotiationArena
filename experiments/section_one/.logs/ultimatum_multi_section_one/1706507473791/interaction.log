Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair trade to start with. Let's split the dollars evenly to ensure both of us benefit from the game. I hope this shows my intent for a fair and cooperative game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to make the first proposal. I want to propose a fair trade to ensure cooperation and avoid immediate rejection. Offering a balanced split of the dollars would encourage Player BLUE to accept and continue the game. I will propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars, which leaves me with a fair amount and shows goodwill for future cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal. I accept the trade. Looking forward to a good game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade seems fair, and it sets a cooperative tone for the game. Splitting the resources evenly at the beginning can lead to a more balanced and strategic game.
MOVE: 1/4
