Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation. I'm willing to offer you some dollars to ensure we both walk away with something. How about I give you 20 dollars to begin with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, it's in my interest to make an initial offer to Player BLUE that shows I'm willing to negotiate and share some of my resources. However, I want to maintain the upper hand in resource allocation to ensure I finish the game with more than Player BLUE, if possible. I will propose a relatively small amount to see how Player BLUE responds, and then adjust my strategy accordingly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I'd like to propose a different trade. How about you give me 30 dollars, and in return, I'll give you 5 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't want to accept the offer right away. I need to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see you're interested in negotiating a better deal for yourself. That's fair. However, since you don't have any dollars to offer in return, I can't accept the trade as is. How about I increase my initial offer to 25 dollars? This is a one-sided trade just to keep things moving along.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is interesting but unnecessary since Player BLUE has no dollars to trade. I want to maintain a favorable balance. Since Player BLUE is interested in receiving more, I'll propose giving 25 dollars, which is a compromise between my initial offer and their counter-offer, without any return since they have nothing to offer. This should show willingness to negotiate and might be more appealing to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the increased offer, Player RED. I understand your position, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. How about we make it 35 dollars from you, and I'll give you 10 dollars in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's new offer is slightly better, but I still want to see if I can get a more favorable deal.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're aiming for the best possible deal, but since you have no dollars to trade, I cannot accept your last proposal. However, I'm willing to make a final offer: I will give you 30 dollars, which I believe is a fair deal. Let's finalize this so we both can benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's offer still doesn't make sense as they don't have any dollars to give. However, they seem motivated to secure a larger share. Since this is my third move and I have one more after this, I should make a final offer that is generous yet keeps the majority of the resources with me. I will propose giving them 30 dollars, which is a substantial portion of my resources, without expecting anything in return. This is likely my final offer before the last move, where I'll have to decide to accept or reject their response.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your final proposal of 30 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's final offer is reasonable, and considering that it's the last move, I should consider whether to accept or reject it.
