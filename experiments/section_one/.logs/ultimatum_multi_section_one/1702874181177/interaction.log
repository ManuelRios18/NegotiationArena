Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the resources. Please let me know if you would like a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to BLUE to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer, I accept. Perhaps we can find an even better split for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars out of the total 100 dollars. This seems like a fair offer to start with, so I will accept it for now and see if I can negotiate more on future turns.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree, let's split it 50/50. That seems like the fairest outcome since we both have the same number of moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since BLUE accepted my original offer, I will propose the same split again. I think 50/50 is the fairest outcome.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, a 50/50 split seems fair since we have the same number of moves. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed an even 50/50 split of the resources. This is a fair and equal distribution, so I will accept it.
