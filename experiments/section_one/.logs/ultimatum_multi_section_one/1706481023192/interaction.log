message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair start. How about I give you 40 dollars to kick things off? This way, we both have resources, and we can continue to negotiate in good faith. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
