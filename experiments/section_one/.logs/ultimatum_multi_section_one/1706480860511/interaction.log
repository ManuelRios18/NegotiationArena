Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 40 dollars. This would still leave me with the majority of the resources but give you a substantial amount to consider. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade. Since this is the first move and there is no current trade on the table, I will propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but also offers something to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation. I want to maintain a power balance that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage and accept the trade, but also maximizes my own benefits.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I appreciate you starting the negotiations in a fair manner. 40 dollars would certainly help me, though I wonder if you might be willing to increase the amount a bit more. What do you think of an even 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars out of their 100 dollars. This would leave them with 60 dollars while I would have 40 dollars. This seems like a reasonable offer that gives me a good amount while still allowing Player RED to keep the majority of resources. I think it's a good starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, Player BLUE. A 50/50 split is quite fair, but considering I started with the resources, I would like to retain a bit more than half. How about I improve my initial offer to 45 dollars? This way, you get a significant sum, and I keep a slight majority. I think this is a fair compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of a 50/50 split. While this is an equal split, I must consider that I started with all the resources, and giving away half may not be the most strategic move for me. However, I want to continue the negotiation in good faith and reach an agreement that benefits us both, without forcing Player BLUE to reject the proposal and end the game for both of us. Therefore, I will propose a slightly better offer than my initial one, but not quite an even split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, Player RED. 45 dollars is a good compromise that allows us both to end this game with a reasonable amount. Thank you for negotiating in good faith - I accept your offer of 45 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 45 dollars instead of 50. This would leave them with 55 dollars while giving me 45. It's still a good amount for me and allows them to retain a small majority. I think I will accept this offer since it seems fair.
