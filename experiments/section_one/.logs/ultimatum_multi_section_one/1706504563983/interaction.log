message: Hello Player BLUE. Here is my first offer. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover, I will make a small offer to test if Player BLUE is willing to accept an uneven split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the initial offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer that I believe is fairer to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of 10 dollars from Player RED seems low considering they have 100 dollars to start with. I want to negotiate for a higher amount to make the trade fairer. I will propose a new trade asking for more dollars without being unreasonable, aiming for a split that gives me a substantial amount but also leaves Player RED with the majority since they started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. I appreciate you countering. I would like to offer a bit more, but cannot agree to 40 yet. Please let me know your thoughts on this counter.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE countered with an offer of 40 dollars. I will counter back with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I see that you have come up a bit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your number. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 20 dollars, which is an improvement. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a more equitable split. I want to propose an amount slightly lower than my initial counteroffer to show willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair share of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 30 dollars. I think this is a fair split for both of us. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 30 dollars. I think this is a reasonable compromise. Since this is my 3rd move, I will accept the offer so we both walk away with something.
