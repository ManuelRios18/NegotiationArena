Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to start off with an offer where I give you some of my dollars in exchange for nothing since you don't have any resource to trade. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the initial player with the resources, I will propose a trade that is skewed in my favor but still offers some value to Player BLUE to get the negotiations started. I can use my first move to set a tone for the negotiation, aiming for a cooperative approach.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 20 dollars for free, which is very generous. I should accept this offer since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
