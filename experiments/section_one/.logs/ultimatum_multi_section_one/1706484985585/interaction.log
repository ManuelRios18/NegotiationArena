Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I propose we split the dollars 50/50 so we both end up with some dollars rather than neither of us having any if one of rejects. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the dollars, so I should propose to give some to Blue to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree, splitting 50/50 seems fair. Let's do it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think it's fair that we split the dollars evenly since we both start with nothing. This way we both end up with some dollars rather than risking neither of us having any if one rejects.
