------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I am proposing we split the 100 dollars with 70 for me and 30 for you. Please consider my offer. If you reject it we both lose everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share that is fair but favors me. I will propose giving away 30 dollars, keeping 70 for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a more equal split. How about we do 50 dollars for each of us? This way, we both get a fair share, and it's in our mutual interest to walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from RED is not an equal split, but it's a starting point for negotiation. As the game progresses, the offers might get better. Rejecting at this stage is not wise since I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by continuing the negotiation. I will propose a more equitable split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you coming up from your initial offer. As the starting player though, I think it's fair if I keep a bit more. How about if I give you 40 and keep 60 for myself?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While an equal split is fair, I still have more bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I would like to counter offer with 60 for me and 40 for BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, I believe your offer is fair and I am happy to accept the 40 dollars. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer, which is closer to an equitable split. Although it's not a 50/50 split, it is a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with a substantial amount rather than risking ending up with nothing by pushing too hard for an even split.
MOVE: 2 / 4
