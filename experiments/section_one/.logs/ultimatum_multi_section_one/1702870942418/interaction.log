message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars equally 50/50 since I started with all 100. Please let me know your thoughts on this initial proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal 50/50 split to be fair.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I agree to the 50/50 split. Let's both walk away with an equal share.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of splitting the dollars equally seems fair and beneficial for both players. This way, we both end with a substantial amount of dollars without risking losing everything by rejecting the proposal.
