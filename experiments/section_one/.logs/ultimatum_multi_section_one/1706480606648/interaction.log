Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair split where you get a good amount of dollars to start with, and we both walk away with something. Let's work together and avoid ending the game with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am in control of the resources and can make the initial offer. I want to propose a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept, but I also want to keep a majority of the resources since I am the one with the initial amount. A 60-40 split could be seen as fair, giving Player BLUE a significant amount while I keep more for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer to get me started. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can either accept or reject the offer, but cannot propose a counteroffer. 40 dollars seems fair for me to start with.
