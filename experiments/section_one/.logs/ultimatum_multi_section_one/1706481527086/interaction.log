------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair offer. How about we split the dollars evenly? That way we both have an equal stake in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that will give BLUE some resources to work with, which might entice them to continue the game rather than rejecting the trade and ending the game with nothing. I will propose a 50-50 split as an opening offer, which is fair and shows good faith in sharing resources equally.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair offer to open with. I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair to start. If I reject or counter too aggressively, Player RED may get upset and reject, leaving us both with nothing.
