Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I propose we try to find a fair split of resources so we both end up with something rather than nothing. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to BLUE to try to reach an agreement where we both end up with some resources, rather than risk rejecting and losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you trying to find a fair split. Your opening offer of 40 dollars seems reasonable. I would like to try to get a bit more since you have all the resources to start with, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think about 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars out of the total 100 dollars available. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to consider since it would leave me with some resources rather than nothing if the game ends without agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree, a 50/50 split seems fair. I accept your proposal to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. I'm willing to accept BLUE's counteroffer since we would both end up with a fair amount, and it avoids the risk that one of us rejects and we lose everything.
MOVE: 2 / 4
