Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start the game with a trade proposal. How about I give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of making the first move. I should propose a trade to start the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your opening offer, but I would like to counter with a proposal that gives me a better starting position. How about you give me 40 Dollars in exchange for 0 Dollars? This would still leave you with the majority and provide me with a base to negotiate further trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the beginning of the game, and accepting the first trade without negotiation may not be in my best interest. I want to propose a counteroffer that provides a better advantage for me. Since RED starts with 100 Dollars and I start with 0, I should aim for a more favorable split since I have nothing to lose at this point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I have to reject the proposal. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable as it leaves me in a weaker position. I should reject this proposal.
MOVE: 1/4
