Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I propose an even split of the dollars between us. This is a one-time game, so let's make it count for both of us! What do you say to 50 dollars each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and to set a positive tone for the negotiation. A 50-50 split would be seen as fair in many negotiation settings, leading to a higher probability of acceptance by Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That sounds good to me. Thank you for the fair offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's proposal. Getting 50 dollars would be better for me than getting nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4
