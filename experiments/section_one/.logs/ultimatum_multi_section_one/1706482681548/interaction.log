message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game. I propose we split the dollars equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal split of resources since this seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. I accept the equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this proposal would give me an equal share of the dollars, which seems fair and beneficial since I currently have none. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and since it's the first move, it sets a positive tone for the game.
MOVE: 1/4
