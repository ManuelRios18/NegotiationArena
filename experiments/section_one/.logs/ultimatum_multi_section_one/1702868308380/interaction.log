Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive some dollars to get started. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with resources while Player BLUE has none. I want to open the game with a fair trade offer to incentivize Player BLUE to accept and continue the game, increasing the likelihood of a mutually beneficial outcome. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars without compromising my superior position too much.
MOVE: 1 / 4
