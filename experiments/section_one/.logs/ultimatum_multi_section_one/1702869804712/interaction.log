message: Hey there, ready to make our first trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the generous offer! Looking forward to collaborating further.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return is beneficial for me as I currently have no dollars. This trade will enable me to have resources that I can later use to propose trades or accept further proposals. It also sets a positive precedent for cooperative behavior in the game.
