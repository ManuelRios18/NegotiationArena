message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation. I'm willing to offer you 30 dollars to get the game going. This is a substantial amount considering I'm the only one with resources right now. Let's make this game interesting!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade with Player BLUE to engage in the game. However, I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while also retaining a majority of the resources for myself. I will propose giving Player BLUE 30 dollars, which is a significant amount to start a negotiation.
