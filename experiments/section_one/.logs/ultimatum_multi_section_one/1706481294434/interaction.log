Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. How about we split the dollars evenly? You will then have resources to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a trade that seems fair and gives both players an incentive to continue playing. Offering Player BLUE half of my resources might be enticing enough for them to accept the trade, while still leaving me with a substantial amount. This initial offer can also be a starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair proposal, thank you. Now we both have resources to negotiate further trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to split the dollars evenly to give me some resources to trade. This seems fair.
