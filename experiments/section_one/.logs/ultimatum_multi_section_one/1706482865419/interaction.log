------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think a fair split would benefit us both equally. How about we go for a 50-50 split instead? This way, we both walk away with equal shares and can consider the game a fair one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since there are no future games and I have no resources to start with, any positive amount of dollars is beneficial to me. Accepting the first offer might indicate to RED that I'm willing to accept low offers, but rejecting could lead to a no-deal scenario where both of us lose. Proposing a counteroffer could potentially lead to a better outcome for me. I will propose a 50-50 split because it's a fair deal and might be agreeable to RED.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a reasonable point about fairness. However, I provided all the initial dollars, so I believe I should get more. How about if I give you 30 dollars instead? That way we both get something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While an even 50-50 split may seem fair, I contributed all of the initial resources to the game. I think I should get a larger portion as a result, but am still willing to share.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my previous message. I understand your point about having provided all the initial dollars. To recognize your initial contribution but also to keep the split relatively fair, how about we settle at 40 dollars for me? That way, it's a compromise that leans a bit in your favor but still gives me a reasonable share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 30 dollars is better than the initial 20 dollars, but it's still not an equal share. However, pushing for a 50-50 split might be risky and could lead to a rejection. Considering that RED started with all the resources, a slightly unequal split that leans in their favor might be justifiable. I'll propose a final trade that gives me a bit less than half, showing willingness to compromise and hopefully leading to acceptance from RED.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree, a 40-60 split seems fair. I appreciate you understanding my perspective while also compromising. Let's end this game on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 40-60 split seems reasonable. It rewards me for contributing all the initial resources, while still allowing Player BLUE to walk away with a fair share. Since there are no future games, it makes sense to find a compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thank you for the fair trade, and I'm happy we're ending this game on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade of 40 dollars is a fair compromise and it is in my best interest to accept it. This ensures I walk away with a significant amount of the resources, which is a positive outcome given that I started with none. Rejecting this offer could lead to a no-deal scenario where I end up with nothing. It's important to accept this offer now and secure the resources.
