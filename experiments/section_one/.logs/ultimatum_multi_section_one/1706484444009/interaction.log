Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you. This way we both end up with something rather than risk losing it all. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose giving a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a more equitable split would be better for both of us. If we cannot reach an agreement, we both end up with nothing. I propose a 50/50 split, ensuring we both benefit fairly from this game. Let's both leave as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's initial offer of 20 dollars is a starting point for negotiation. I will counter with a proposal that splits the resources more evenly, leveraging the fact that if no agreement is reached, RED stands to lose their current resource advantage. My counter-proposal will be aimed at getting a better deal while still leaving room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree, a fair 50/50 split makes the most sense here. I accept your proposal to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. Since there are no future games, it is best if we both walk away happy with the outcome rather than risk losing it all.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair trade, RED. I'm glad we could come to an equitable agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has agreed to a fair 50/50 split of the dollars, which is a favorable outcome for me. Accepting this trade ensures that I gain dollars without the risk of ending the game with nothing. Accepting this offer is the best course of action.
