message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair offer. I propose giving you 50 dollars for nothing in return, so we both have equal resources to move forward with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to engage in negotiations and show goodwill. I propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars in exchange for 0, as they have nothing to trade. This split gives us both an equal share and creates a foundation for trust and cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept and appreciate you starting our negotiation on an equitable basis.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars for free, which seems like a fair and generous offer. Since I have no resources to trade at the moment, accepting this would put us on more equal footing as we continue negotiating.
