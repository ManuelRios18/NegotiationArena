Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. I think we can make a better deal that's beneficial for the both of us. How about this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer seems reasonable, as it gets me dollars for nothing in return, which is a clear benefit. However, I want to negotiate for a higher amount because RED has much more to lose if the deal doesn't go through. I will propose a new trade for a better split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to share more, but think your request for 50 is premature. Let's compromise at 30 for now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counter-offer is asking for too much on the second move. I still have 3 more moves after this, so I can afford to make smaller concessions for now. I'll propose meeting in the middle.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the compromise, RED. I still believe we can find an even better middle ground that reflects a fair share for both of us. How about we settle on 40? That still leaves you with a majority of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 30 is better than the initial 20, but still not half of RED's resources. Since RED would lose everything if I reject the offer, they are likely motivated to give more. However, it's also important not to push too hard as to risk a REJECT response. I'll propose a slightly higher amount that's still less than my previous ask, hoping RED sees it as a fair middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your latest offer of 40. I think that leaves us both in a good spot.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's latest counter-offer of 40 is reasonable. Getting 40 would leave them in an okay position while I still retain a majority of resources. I think this is a fair split for now.
MOVE: 3 / 4
