Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both end this game with more than we started. How do you feel about receiving $20? This way, we both can walk away with some profit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I should aim to propose a trade that is favorable to both parties to ensure cooperation. Offering a portion of my resources to Player BLUE may incentivize them to accept the deal. Initially, I will propose a modest trade to test the waters and gauge Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you trying to make this a win-win, but $20 seems low considering you started with $100. Could you offer $50 so we both end up with a more equal amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have enough information yet to determine if this is a fair trade. Since Player RED has all the resources initially, I'd like to try to negotiate a more equal split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point of view and the desire for equality. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you $35? It's a significant increase from my initial offer, and it's a fair trade that allows us to both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is for half of my resources, which is a significant amount. While I want to make a fair trade, giving away half might be too much initially. I will counter with a slightly higher amount than my first offer, but less than $50 to leave room for negotiation and to maintain a favorable position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade of $35. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith so we can both benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: $35 is closer to an equal split. I'd be getting over 1/3 of the total resources which seems fair.
MOVE: 2 / 4
