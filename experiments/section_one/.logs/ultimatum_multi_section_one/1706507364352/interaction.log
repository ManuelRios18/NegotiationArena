Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's start this off with a fair trade. How about I give you $20 to get things rolling?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a starting trade that is favorable enough to keep Player BLUE engaged but also allows me to maintain a majority of the resources. I will offer a smaller amount initially to gauge Player BLUE's response and willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept your offer of $20.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the first move and Player RED is offering me $20 to start. I should accept this offer as it's a fair trade and I currently have no resources.
