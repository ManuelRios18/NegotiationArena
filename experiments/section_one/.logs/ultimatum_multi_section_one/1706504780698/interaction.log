Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's play a fair game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the initial offer, RED. However, I would appreciate a bit more to consider it a fair start. How about 40 dollars? This way, it's still a win for you as you retain the majority of the funds.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe starting with a 20:0 offer is reasonable from RED's perspective as they have all the resources, but I want to negotiate for a better split. Proposing a new trade to see if RED is willing to give a bit more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair. I accept your counteroffer of 40 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. 40 is still a good amount for me to retain a majority. I should accept this offer in good faith to continue negotiations.
MOVE: 2 / 4
