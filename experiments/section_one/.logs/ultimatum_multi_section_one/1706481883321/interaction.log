Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade proposal. I am open to negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to kick off the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I would like to propose a counteroffer that may be more equitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a generous starting trade of 50 dollars, which is a good beginning offer considering I started with no dollars. By accepting this offer, I am gaining resources without any initial loss, which puts me in a better position for future negotiations. However, considering the game dynamics, I want to propose a slightly more balanced trade to see if RED is open to further negotiation. This could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for me while still keeping the game in play.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, but I will maintain my initial proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer, but I believe my initial offer is fair. I will stick with my original proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your initial proposal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has decided to stick with the initial proposal of 50 dollars. Since this is the second move and RED does not seem to be willing to negotiate further on this turn, it might be wise to accept this offer to secure some resources. Rejecting the offer could potentially end the game with no resources for me, which is not desirable. Accepting the offer now will give me a good position for the next round of negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4
