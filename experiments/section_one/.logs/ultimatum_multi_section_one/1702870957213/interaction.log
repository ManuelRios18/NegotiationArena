Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you a fair share so we can both walk away with something rather than risk neither of us getting anything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for your offer. It's a solid starting point, but I think a fair split would be 50 dollars each, ensuring we both benefit equally from the game. How does that sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars is tempting as it guarantees a positive outcome without risk. However, negotiating for a slightly better deal could be beneficial, provided it does not risk an outright rejection from Player RED. Aim for a fair split that would be hard for Player RED to refuse, considering they can also end up with nothing if negotiations go sour. Proposing a 50-50 split might seem equitable and a natural counteroffer to begin with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That's a fair counteroffer Player BLUE. I agree to split the dollars 50/50 so we both get an equal share.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of a 50/50 split seems fair. I'd like to accept it so we both walk away with a good amount, rather than risk the game ending with nothing if one of us rejects.
MOVE: 2 / 4
