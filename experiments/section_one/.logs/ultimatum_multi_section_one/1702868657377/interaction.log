Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start on good terms and split the dollars evenly. What do you say to a 50-50 split? This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking it all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm initiating the game with a fair offer to split the resources evenly with Player BLUE, aiming to create a cooperative dynamic from the start. An equal split is often seen as fair in game theory and negotiations, and may increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer. I agree to split the dollars 50-50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 50-50 split of the dollars. This seems fair. Since I have no dollars to start with, getting 50 would be good for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4
