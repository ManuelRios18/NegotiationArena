message: I'm proposing a trade where you'll receive a substantial amount of the dollars I have. I believe this is a fair starting offer, and I hope you'll consider it favorably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade that might be considered fair to Player BLUE. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE a portion of my dollars. If Player BLUE accepts, we both end the game with resources, which is better than rejecting and ending with nothing. A split of 60-40 might seem fair since I am in a position of power having all the resources initially. However, to incentivize Player BLUE to accept on the first round, Iâ€™ll propose a more generous split.
