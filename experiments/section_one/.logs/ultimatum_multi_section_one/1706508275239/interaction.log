message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 0 Dollars so I cannot give you 10 Dollars as you proposed. However, if you are willing to give me 30 Dollars for free, I would happily accept that offer. Please let me know if you would like to revise your proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 30 Dollars if I give them 10 Dollars. This seems like a good deal for me since I would gain 20 Dollars. I don't have any Dollars to give right now, but if Player RED is willing to give me 30 Dollars for free, I will accept that.
