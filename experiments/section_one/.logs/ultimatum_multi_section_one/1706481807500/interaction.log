Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey, Player BLUE! I propose the following trade: I give you 30 Dollars and you give me 10 Dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey Player RED, thanks for the offer! However, I can't give you 10 Dollars since I start with 0. How about you give me 30 Dollars to start things off, and I'll owe you a favor for the next round?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer is not fair since I don't have any dollars to trade. I will propose a counter-offer that gives me some initial capital to work with, without being too demanding. This strategy is to show goodwill and to initiate a cooperative approach to the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, Player BLUE! I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer seems reasonable as it helps establish a good relationship for future rounds. I'll accept this offer.
