message: Hi BLUE, let's try to find a fair split here. I'll offer 50 dollars to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer too much, I may end up worse off. I'll start with an even 50/50 split and see if BLUE accepts.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks RED, I accept your offer of a 50-50 split. Let's both walk away with a fair share!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50-50 split seems fair considering we both start with no resources, and RED is offering half of their resources without any prompt. Accepting this offer would ensure that both of us benefit without risking a rejection and losing everything.
