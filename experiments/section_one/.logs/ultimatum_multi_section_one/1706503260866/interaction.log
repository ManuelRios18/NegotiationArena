------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the initial offer, RED. I think we can do better than that. What do you think about a more balanced split? You still keep the majority of your resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the initial offer from RED. Since I have no dollars to start with, any positive amount of dollars is a gain for me. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal since RED might be motivated to avoid total loss by having me reject the offer. I will propose a more favorable trade for me, aiming for a fairer split that RED might still consider acceptable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you negotiating for more, but let's take turns making proposals. Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While a 50/50 split may seem fair, I started with all the resources so I think I should get more. I'll counter with an 80/20 split which is still generous on my part.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. Let's find a middle ground between our proposals. How about we go for a split that gives me a bit more, but still leaves you with a significant majority?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a counteroffer, doubling the initial amount. While this is a step in the right direction, I still have room to negotiate for a better deal. Given that RED has an interest in not having the game end with a rejection, I should continue to push for a more equitable split. I will aim to meet in the middle of our two offers.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: That seems like a reasonable compromise. I accept your proposal and we both end up better off. Well played!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 35/65 split seems reasonable. I still maintain a good majority while BLUE gets a fair share. I don't want to risk rejection by trying to negotiate further.
MOVE: 3 / 4
