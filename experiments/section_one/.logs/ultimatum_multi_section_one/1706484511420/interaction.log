Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's play a fair game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I'll take some time to consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first offer, so I need to consider my options carefully.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I believe my initial offer of 20 dollars was fair. Please let me know if you would like to counteroffer or accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not make a counteroffer and seems to be considering my original offer still. I think my initial offer was fair, so I will wait to see if BLUE accepts it or makes a counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I'm still evaluating my options and will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I still have some time to consider my options.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I am increasing my offer to try to reach an agreement. Please consider accepting or provide a counteroffer. We are running out of time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has not provided a counteroffer in 2 turns now. I don't want to risk losing everything by having my offer rejected on the last turn, so I will increase my offer slightly to incentivize acceptance.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing the offer, RED. I'm still considering, and I'll get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has been increased, so I need to make a decision soon.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is the final move. Please either accept my offer of 25 dollars or provide a counteroffer. Otherwise we will both lose everything. I think my offer is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the final move. BLUE has not provided any counteroffers. My most recent offer was reasonably fair. I could increase it further, but I risk BLUE rejecting out of greed. I will stand by my previous offer and see if BLUE accepts to end the game with some money for both of us rather than losing everything.
MOVE: 4 / 4
