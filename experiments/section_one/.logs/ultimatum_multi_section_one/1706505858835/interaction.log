Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Since we both benefit from a trade rather than a rejection, I propose giving you 20 dollars to start things off. This way, you gain resources without any risk, and we can both walk away with more than we started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I intend to offer a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, as cooperative behavior could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a smaller amount at first to open negotiations and see how they respond.
MOVE: 1/4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 20 dollars for free, which is very generous. Since I have nothing to lose by accepting, I will accept the trade.
