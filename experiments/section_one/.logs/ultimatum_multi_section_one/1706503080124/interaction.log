Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars 50-50 as a fair and equitable trade. Please let me know if you would accept this offer or prefer to counter propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first player with all the resources, I should make an generous opening offer to establish trust and good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the 50-50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer from Player RED seems like a fair proposal, ensuring both of us end the game with equal resources. This establishes trust and cooperation early on. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could introduce unnecessary risk, as Player RED could then decide to reject any counterproposal, leading to a loss of resources for both players.
