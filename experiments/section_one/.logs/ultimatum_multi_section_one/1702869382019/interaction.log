message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to end this game positively for both of us. I propose I give you 20 dollars to start things off. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I am in a stronger position with 100 dollars and the ability to propose trades. My goal is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Player BLUE. I want to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to cooperate, but also keeps the majority of the resources with me. I will start with a conservative offer to test the waters.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. Thank you for the generous offer! I was hoping we could find an even split that works for both of us though. What do you think about 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 20 dollars to start, which is generous. I'd like to try to negotiate for more though.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for a fair split. A 50/50 split is quite generous from my side, considering I started with all the resources. How about we settle on 40 dollars to you? This still gives you a substantial amount and acknowledges the initial resource distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has responded favorably to the initial contact and has proposed an even split. While a 50/50 split is equitable, it might not be the most strategic move for me since I started with all the resources. I want to negotiate a deal that's fair but also reflects the initial resource distribution. I'll counter with a slightly more favorable offer to me that still gives Player BLUE a significant amount but less than half.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, a 40/60 split acknowledges the initial distribution while still giving me a substantial share. Thank you for the fair offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED makes a good point that they started with all the resources. A 40/60 split seems reasonably fair considering that.
