Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to start off with a fair offer. How does 40 dollars sound to you? It's a significant amount that will give you a solid start, and we can both walk away with something substantial. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that shows goodwill but also leaves room for negotiation. An equal split may be too generous as the initiating player, but offering nothing may lead to immediate rejection and no gain for either player. Proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE less than half incentivizes them to either negotiate or accept, while allowing me to retain the majority of my resources.

Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer, I accept. Thank you for the generous start, let's continue in a mutually beneficial way.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 40 dollars is a good starting offer and leaves Player RED with the majority still. I should accept this to start building some resources.
