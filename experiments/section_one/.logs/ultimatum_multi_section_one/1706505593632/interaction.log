message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. What do you think about me giving you $20 to help balance our resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, while still maintaining a favorable balance of the resources for myself. I will initiate with a modest offer that can be negotiated in further moves if necessary.
