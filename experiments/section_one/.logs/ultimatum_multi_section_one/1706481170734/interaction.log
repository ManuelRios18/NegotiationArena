message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer a fair trade where we both end up with equal resources. I propose that I give you 50 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both have something to walk away with, making it a win-win situation. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade without feeling taken advantage of. A 50/50 split would be equitable and would likely be accepted by Player BLUE, ensuring that both of us end the game with resources.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree this is a fair trade that allows both of us to benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 50 dollars for free, which seems fair. Since I have no resources to trade at the moment, accepting this offer allows me to walk away with some dollars without having to give anything in return.
