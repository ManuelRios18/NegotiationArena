message: Hi Blue, I have all the money right now, but I'm willing to share some with you so we both benefit. How about I give you 20 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of principle and we'll both lose. I'll start with an offer to split the pot 80/20 in my favor since I'm in the stronger bargaining position.
