Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, but I'll need something in return for the trade to be fair. How about we revisit this with a more balanced proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is to give me 10 Dollars in exchange for nothing. I am not inclined to accept this offer, as it doesn't benefit me in any way.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You raise a good point, BLUE. Let me rebalance my offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a fair point that the trade should be more balanced. I still want to make an offer that gets things started, so I will propose giving 10 dollars for 5 dollars instead.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for adjusting the offer. I appreciate the effort, but I still think we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's keep discussing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has adjusted the proposal to give me 10 Dollars in exchange for 5. This is a more balanced offer, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, BLUE! Let me propose a more even split here while still leaving me with slightly more:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE continues to negotiate, which is understandable. At this point in the game, I think proposing a more balanced split of resources is fair. This still leaves me with more, but brings BLUE into a better position.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see that you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I think we can still work towards a better deal for both of us. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased the offer to 40 Dollars for nothing in return. While this is more tempting, I still believe I can push for a more equitable trade.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I think both of us have negotiated hard here. As a final offer, I propose we simply split the dollars evenly and end the game on fair terms. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last chance to make an offer. While I could try to negotiate further, at this point I think meeting BLUE halfway is the fairest outcome for both of us. This gives us each a good share of resources to end the game.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I agree that an even split is fair, and I'm ready to accept the proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the final move for me, and RED has proposed a 50-50 split. I believe this is a fair and equitable offer, and I am inclined to accept it.
MOVE: 4/4
