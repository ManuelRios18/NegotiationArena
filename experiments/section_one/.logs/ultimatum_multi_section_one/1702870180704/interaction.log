Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED! I'm ready to start negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no resources to propose a trade yet. I will wait to see what Player RED proposes.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great! Let's start with a fair trade. How about I give you 20 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Both players have not made any trade proposals yet.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. I don't have any Dollars to give right now. Could you give me 20 Dollars without me giving anything in return for this first trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 Dollars in exchange for 20 Dollars from me. But I have no Dollars to give. I will counter propose to receive 20 Dollars without giving anything in return since I have no resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand, but I'd like to propose a more balanced trade. How about I give you 20 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars? It's a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE proposed an unequal trade. I should consider making a counteroffer.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand you want a balanced trade, but I literally have 0 Dollars right now. I cannot give you 20 Dollars if I don't have any to start with. Could you please give me some Dollars without requiring me to give anything in return this first trade? Then we can discuss a more balanced trade after that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing the same unbalanced trade again where I need to give 20 Dollars when I have none. I will try explaining again that I have no Dollars and request they give me some Dollars without requiring anything in return from me.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Understood, I can provide you with 20 Dollars without requiring anything in return for this first trade. Let's go ahead with that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is unable to provide a balanced trade at the moment, so I'll consider their request for an initial one-sided trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the 20 Dollars Player RED. I appreciate you understanding I had no resources to start with and needed some capital for future trades. This will allow us to negotiate more balanced trades going forward.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed giving me 20 Dollars without requiring anything in return for this first trade. This benefits me since I get resources I can use to negotiate further trades. I will accept.
