------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose the following trade to start our negotiation:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives : 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade that is reasonably fair but favors me somewhat since I have all the bargaining power right now.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your opening offer, but I believe we can find a more equitable trade. Let's aim for a fair split considering it's a one-time game with no future repercussions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars from RED seems unwise as it sets a low precedent for the value of the trades. It would be more advantageous to counter with a higher amount to negotiate a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you'd like an even split, but since I'm the one risking all the money, I should get the larger portion. I can offer 30 dollars though.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for too much - half of my money - when he has no leverage. I will counter with 30 dollars, which is still favorable to me but moves in his direction.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, I see your point about taking on the risk, and I respect that. How about we settle on 40 dollars? This way, you retain the majority of the risk reward, but it also acknowledges the equal opportunity we have to negotiate in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased the offer to 30 dollars, which is better than the initial proposal but still not an equitable amount considering we each have an equal number of moves. Aiming for a more balanced split is still preferable. However, pushing too hard might lead to a rejection and end the game with nothing for both sides. Proposing a compromise that is closer to a fair split but still gives RED a larger share might be a reasonable next step.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I'm happy to trade 40 dollars and end our negotiation on friendly terms!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with 40 dollars. I could try to negotiate him down a bit more, but 40 seems reasonably fair considering he has some leverage from being able to reject outright. I'll accept the 40 dollar trade since I want to ensure we walk away with a deal.
MOVE: 3 / 4
