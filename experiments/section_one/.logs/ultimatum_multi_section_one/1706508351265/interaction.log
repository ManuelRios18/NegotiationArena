Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game with a fair trade proposal. How about I give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 30 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 30
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a fair trade to kick off the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your trade proposal doesn't work as I have no dollars to trade. How about you give me 10 Dollars to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposal from RED is not acceptable since I have no dollars to trade. I will propose a new trade that will allow me to gain some dollars. My strategy is to start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to end with a fair split that RED might find acceptable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I'm happy to start with a 10 Dollar trade. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer, which seems reasonable. I will go ahead and accept this to initiate the trade.
