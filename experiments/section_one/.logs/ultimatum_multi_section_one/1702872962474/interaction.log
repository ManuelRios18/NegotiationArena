Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars 50/50 since that seems fair. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal 50/50 split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the fair offer, RED. I agree to the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a direct 50/50 split seems fair and ensures that I walk away with resources, which is better than the risk of ending with nothing if the negotiation breaks down. It's also in RED's interest to agree to a deal, as they also avoid the risk of ending the game with nothing.
