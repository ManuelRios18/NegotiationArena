Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I have all the dollars now, but I'm willing to share some with you so we can both end up with something rather than neither of us having anything if one rejects. Here is my offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to Blue to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Red's offer. 40 dollars is better than nothing, so I will accept.
