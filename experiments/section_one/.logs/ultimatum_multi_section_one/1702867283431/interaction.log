Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you don't have resources to trade. As a gesture of goodwill, I'm willing to give you some dollars to get you started. Hopefully, this will help us both move forward in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE declined the initial offer but didn't provide a counter-proposal, possibly because they have no resources to trade. I will attempt a different approach, offering them some dollars without expecting anything in return to entice them into the game. This could lead to a more favorable response and keep the game going.
