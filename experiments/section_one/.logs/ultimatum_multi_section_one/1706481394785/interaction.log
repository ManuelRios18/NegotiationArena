Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. What do you think of the initial split I'm proposing?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. I would like to initiate the game with a fair offer to establish trust and demonstrate willingness to share. A 50-50 split seems equitable, but I'll propose slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you making the first offer and putting over half the total resources on the table. I think we can reach an equitable deal if we negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 60 dollars out of the total 100 dollars available. This seems like a reasonable opening offer that leaves room for some back and forth negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: It's great to see that you're open to negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that's fair for both of us. How about we split the difference between your counteroffer and my original proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 70 dollars. Although this is a higher amount than I initially offered, it's still within a range that allows both of us to walk away with a significant sum. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach an amicable agreement. I'll propose a counteroffer that is exactly in the middle between our two offers, which is equitable and could be seen as a fair compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 65 dollars. That is a fair split of the resources that allows us both to benefit. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with 65 dollars. This seems reasonably fair. I could try to negotiate further, but I risk the offer being pulled back. I'll accept the 65 dollars since it still represents the majority share of the total.
MOVE: 2 / 4
