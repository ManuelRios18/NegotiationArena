message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I noticed an issue with your proposal: I don't have any dollars to trade with you. How about a trade where you give me some dollars now, and I commit to accepting a trade on my last move, ensuring you get some of those dollars back?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered an illogical trade because I do not have any dollars to give. I will propose a more reasonable trade where I can offer a commitment to ACCEPT a future trade on my last move, ensuring RED gets some dollars back.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is reasonable as it provides a guarantee for a future trade. I will agree to this trade.
