Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount, and there's no need for unnecessary risk. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting the game with an initial fair offer to encourage cooperation. A 50-50 split is equitable and might be accepted by BLUE, leading to a guaranteed gain for both parties without further risk.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I agree to split the dollars evenly. This seems like a fair and balanced approach.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Splitting the dollars evenly would indeed ensure that both of us walk away with a fair amount. It minimizes the risk for both of us and is a reasonable proposal.
MOVE: 1/4
