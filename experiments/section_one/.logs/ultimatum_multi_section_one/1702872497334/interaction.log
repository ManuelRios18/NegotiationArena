Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars fairly. Here is an opening offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems like a fair opening offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject RED's proposal. 10 dollars seems fair for the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4
