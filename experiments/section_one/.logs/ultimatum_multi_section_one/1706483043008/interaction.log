message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. I'm willing to share some of my resources so we both end up better off. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
