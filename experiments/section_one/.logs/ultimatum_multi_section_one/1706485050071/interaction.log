message: Hello BLUE, I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Blue a small amount to start negotiating.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate your initial offer but I think 30 dollars would be more fair for me. Could you propose 30 dollars instead of 20?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 20 dollars out of the 100 total. That seems fair for the first offer. I will counter propose getting more.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0

player answer: ACCEPT
