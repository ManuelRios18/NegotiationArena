message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we split the money with 80 dollars for me and 20 dollars for you. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further or if you accept this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade offer to establish negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you offering me some money, but 20 dollars out of 100 seems disproportionately low considering you hold all the resources initially. Could you offer 40 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 20 dollars out of the total 100 dollars. This seems like a low offer considering he has all the money to start with. I will counter offer for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer of 40 dollars. This 60/40 split seems fair. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. I will accept giving 40 dollars while still retaining majority of the funds. This maintains a mutually beneficial split.
MOVE: 2 / 4
