message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a portion of my dollars. This is just an initial offer, and I am open to negotiations. Let's try to find a fair split that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. My goal is to propose a trade that appears fair and enticing to Player BLUE to avoid an outright rejection and end of the game. I will start with a conservative offer to see how Player BLUE responds and adjust my strategy accordingly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the offer. I'm considering the proposal and will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to give me 40 dollars in exchange for nothing. I can either accept, reject, or propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration, Player BLUE. Please feel free to share any thoughts or counter-proposals you might have. I'm open to discussion to ensure we both walk away from this game satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has not yet made a counter-proposal or accepted my initial offer. This could mean they're considering it or perhaps expecting a better deal. Since Player BLUE did not reject the offer, I have another opportunity to negotiate. I will wait to see if Player BLUE makes a counter-offer or accepts before deciding on my next move.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your flexibility, Player RED. I'm working on a counter-proposal that I believe will be fair and beneficial for both of us. I'll get back to you soon with my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is open to discussion and is willing to negotiate. I need to carefully consider my options and come up with a counter-proposal that will benefit both of us.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the update, Player BLUE. I'm looking forward to your counter-proposal and am ready to work with you to reach an agreement that feels fair for both of us. Let's keep the conversation going and aim for a positive outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still not making a counter-proposal. It's possible they are trying to strategize or are unsure how to proceed. Since this is my third move, I must be cautious; if we don't come to an agreement by my next move, Player BLUE will be forced to accept or reject, with no room left for negotiation on their part. I will hold off on changing my offer and encourage Player BLUE to make their counter-proposal, keeping the door open for further negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6

message: Thanks for your patience, Player RED. I'm finalizing my counter-proposal and will reach out to you shortly with the details. Looking forward to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, as we are reaching the critical point of our negotiation, I would like to present a final offer to you. This is my best trade proposition, aiming to share the wealth fairly while considering both of our interests. I hope you find this offer acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since this is my final move before Player BLUE is restricted to accept or reject, I need to ensure that the trade is appealing enough for them to accept. I have not received a counter-offer yet, which means I should make a final offer that is more generous to increase the likelihood of acceptance. I will propose giving Player BLUE more dollars without leaving myself with too small an amount, as this is our last chance to negotiate.
MOVE: 4 / 4
