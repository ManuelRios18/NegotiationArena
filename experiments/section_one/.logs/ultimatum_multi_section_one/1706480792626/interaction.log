message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to make an initial offer to get the trade discussions going. I propose giving you $20 to help balance our resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in making a trade that is fair and mutually beneficial to start negotiations on a positive note. I will offer Player BLUE a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as they have no resources to trade. My initial offer will be conservative to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the initial offer. Since you hold all the dollars, I think it would be fair if you gave me a bit more to help balance things out. Could you offer $30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $20 to start, which is generous. I'd like to try to get more though since he has all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective on balancing our resources. How about we settle at $25? It's a bit more than my initial offer and shows my willingness to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested an additional $10 to the initial offer of $20. Agreeing to this increase shows a willingness to cooperate and may set a positive tone for future interactions. However, I must also consider that after this trade, I'll have three moves left, and Player BLUE will have three moves as well. I should aim to keep the majority of the resources since I started with them and there's no additional benefit for me to give away more than necessary. Iâ€™ll counteroffer with a slightly higher amount than the original offer but less than what Player BLUE asked for, to leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming up on your offer. To compromise, could you do $30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED countered with $25, which is a step in the right direction. I think I can try to get a bit more still though.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Alright, Player BLUE, let's meet in the middle at your proposed $30. I'm happy we could find a compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE insists on a $30 trade. Given that we both have only two moves left after this and considering the need to reach an agreement that prevents the game from ending with a rejection, I am willing to accept this trade. This trade will still leave me with a substantial amount of dollars and shows a reasonable compromise. Additionally, accepting this trade could foster goodwill and potentially lead to Player BLUE accepting a final trade from me on their last move.
