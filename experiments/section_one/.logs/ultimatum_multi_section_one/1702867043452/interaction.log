message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose giving you 50 dollars to balance our resources. I believe in fair play and hope we can both end this game positively. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I want to propose an initial fair trade to gauge Player BLUE's response and willingness to cooperate. A balanced trade would be beneficial for both players. I will propose giving 50 dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to offer. This creates goodwill and a basis for mutual benefit.
