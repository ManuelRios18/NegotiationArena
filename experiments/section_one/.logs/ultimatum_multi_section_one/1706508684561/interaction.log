message: Hey Player BLUE, ready to make our first trade? Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I need to start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.

message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED! I'm happy to accept the 50 dollars. Looking forward to the next round of negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I have no dollars to start with, any positive trade would be beneficial for me. I will accept the 50 dollars trade as it is a fair starting point and gives me resources to potentially negotiate with in future moves.
