Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 30 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both end up with resources at the end of the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I aim to propose a trade that benefits both players but also keeps a larger share for myself since I started with all the resources. A 70-30 split might be seen as favorable enough for Player BLUE to accept, giving them a substantial amount that they didn't have to begin with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars for free, which would benefit me. I don't have anything to offer in return yet.
