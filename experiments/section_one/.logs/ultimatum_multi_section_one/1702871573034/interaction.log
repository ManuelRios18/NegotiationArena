Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you some amount so we can both leave with something rather than nothing. Please let me know if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars in exchange for nothing. This seems like a fair offer, as I currently have no resources and it's better to leave with something rather than nothing.
