Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I start with all the dollars, I would like to offer you some so we can both walk away with something rather than risk ending with nothing. What do you think of this offer to start:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risking the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That is a fair offer, I accept. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's offer. 40 dollars is better than nothing, so I will accept.
