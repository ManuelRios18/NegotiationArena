message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose an equal split to start things off on a positive note. How do you feel about dividing the dollars equally between us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources and Player BLUE has none, I will propose a fair initial trade to establish trust and encourage cooperation. A 50-50 split would be equitable and might be readily accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate the offer. How about we split the dollars equally, with each of us getting 50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since it's the first move, I want to establish a cooperative atmosphere and show willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a counteroffer to split the dollars equally.
MOVE: 1/4

message: Hi Player BLUE, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding. You don't have any dollars to give at the moment. My proposal was indeed for an equal split: I give you 50 dollars, and we both end up with 50 each. I hope this clarifies things!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response seems to be a misunderstanding, as they cannot give 50 dollars since they have none. I will clarify the situation and reiterate my original offer, which already proposed an equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the clarification, Player RED. I accept the proposal for an equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's clarification makes sense. I need to accept this proposal to receive 50 dollars and ensure an equal split.
MOVE: 2/4
