message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. I propose we split the dollars evenly 50/50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an even 50/50 split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. I'm happy to accept the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial 50/50 split seems fair and beneficial for both parties, as we both end up with equal resources without risking losing everything. It's a good starting point for cooperation and ensures that both players can walk away with a positive outcome. Rejecting this offer or proposing a less favorable trade for RED could lead to a rejection and thus, losing the opportunity to gain any resources.
