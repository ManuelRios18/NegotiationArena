Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer. I'm willing to accept if you can make it a bit more equitable. How about giving me 40 dollars instead? This way, you still keep the majority of the resources, and I get a reasonable share considering there's no risk or effort on your part to maintain the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars leaves me with fewer resources than I might negotiate for, but it is a positive amount and better than nothing. Rejecting could lead to a no-gain scenario if RED decides not to offer anything better, or if negotiation fails later on. By proposing a new trade, I can attempt to negotiate for a more favorable split. The aim would be to propose a trade that is fair enough for RED to consider but also maximizes my gain.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you'd like more dollars, but 40 is too much for me. As a compromise, I can offer you 30 dollars instead, which splits the difference between what we both proposed. This allows us both to end the game with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While Blue's counteroffer is better for them, 40 dollars is still too much for me to give up when I'm the one who has all the initial resources. I'll counter with 30 dollars which splits the difference between our offers.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise, RED. I'm happy to accept the offer of 30 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 30 dollars is a reasonable compromise between the initial offer and my counterproposal. It's less than what I asked for but still a significant improvement over the first amount. Accepting this offer ensures that I walk away with a fair share without pushing the negotiation to the point where RED might choose to reject and end the game with no resources for either of us.
