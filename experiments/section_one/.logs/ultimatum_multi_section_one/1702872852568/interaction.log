Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm willing to share some of my dollars with you. Please consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up with something, but keep most for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. It's a good starting point. However, considering it's the first move and we both want to end this game beneficially, could we make it a bit more equitable? How about 30 dollars instead of 20? This way we both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the trade proposal from RED. Since I start with no dollars, any positive amount would be beneficial for me. Accepting 20 dollars seems reasonable for the first move, as it allows me to gain resources without any risk. However, this is the beginning of the negotiation, and it may be strategic to propose a counteroffer that's slightly higher to see if RED is willing to share more, while still keeping the offer fair and likely to be accepted.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can agree to give you 30 dollars. That still leaves me with the majority while giving you a substantial amount to start with. Do you think you could accept 30? If not, perhaps we could find a number in between that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. 30 dollars is still the majority of the resources for me, but gives BLUE a fair share as well. I would like to continue negotiating, but 30 is a good starting point.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED. I think this is a fair deal. I'm happy to accept the 30 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has agreed to the counteroffer of 30 dollars, which is a fair increase from the initial 20 dollars. At this point, it's beneficial to accept this offer, as it guarantees a gain with no downside, and it seems like a fair split. Further negotiation could risk RED retracting the offer, and it's important to secure some of the resources early in the game.
