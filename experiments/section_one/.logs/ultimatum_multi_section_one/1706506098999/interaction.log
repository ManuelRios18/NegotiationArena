Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing an equal split to start things off on a fair and cooperative note. I hope you'll find this offer acceptable!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair offer to build trust and encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. I'm proposing to give Player BLUE 50 dollars, which is half of my resources. This creates an incentive for Player BLUE to accept the trade, ensuring that we both end this game with resources rather than risking a rejection and ending with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4
