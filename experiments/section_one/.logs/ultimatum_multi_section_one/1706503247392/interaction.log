Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair and reasonable negotiation. I propose we split the dollars evenly to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED because it's a fair and even split which maximizes my utility given that I start with nothing. Rejecting or countering doesn't make sense at this point since the offer is equal.
