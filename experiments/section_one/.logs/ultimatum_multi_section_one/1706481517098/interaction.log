message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in making a trade that benefits us both. How does an initial offer of $20 sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade to start the negotiation process. I'll offer Player BLUE a modest amount of dollars to see if they are interested in cooperating for a mutually beneficial outcome. This initial offer is a feeler to gauge Player BLUE's response and willingness to engage in trade.
