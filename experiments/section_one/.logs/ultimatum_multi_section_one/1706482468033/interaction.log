------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars 50/50 so we both walk away with something rather than risk losing it all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount of dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. It's a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the 50/50 split seems fair as it guarantees that both players walk away with a substantial amount. Rejecting the offer or countering it with a less favorable split for RED might lead to them rejecting any trade, resulting in both of us losing everything. Accepting the first offer also builds trust for any future interactions, even though the rules specify there are no future games.
