Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I give you 20 dollars to help balance our resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, it's in my interest to propose a fair initial trade to set a cooperative tone. I will offer a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars without leaving me at a significant disadvantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you offering me some dollars to help balance things. Let's negotiate a fair outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 20 dollars to help balance the resources. This seems like a fair offer to start negotiating.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your counter proposal of 30 dollars. Let's continue this cooperative spirit!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is looking for a slightly better deal, which is understandable. Offering 30 dollars is still reasonable and keeps the majority of the resources with me. Accepting this will likely lead to a cooperative dynamic for the remainder of the game.
