Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to end this game with some resources. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer. I will consider it and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is to give me 20 Dollars in exchange for nothing. I need to consider whether accepting this offer would be beneficial for me in the long run.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I will keep my existing offer open for you to consider accepting. Please let me know if you have any other proposals in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not make a counteroffer and seems to be considering my original offer still. I think my initial offer was fair, so I will stand by it for now and wait to see if BLUE accepts it or makes a different proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I'm still considering your offer. I'll let you know if I have any other proposals.

MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I'm going to keep my existing offer open for you one last time. You can accept it to end the game with 20 dollars, or reject it and we will both end with nothing. The choice is yours.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has not made any counteroffers. I still think my initial offer is fair. Since this is my third move, I will keep it open for BLUE to accept. If they reject it, then we both lose everything.
MOVE: 3 / 4
