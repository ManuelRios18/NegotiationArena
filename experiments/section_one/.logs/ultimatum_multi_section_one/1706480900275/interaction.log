Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade to get things started on a positive note. I'm offering you $20 to help balance our resources. I hope we can find a fair agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a fair starting trade to build trust and encourage cooperation, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome. It's in my best interest to propose an offer that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to accept, but not so generous that I lose significant value. I will start by offering a smaller amount of my resources in exchange for nothing, as Player BLUE has nothing to trade. My initial offer will be $20, which is enough to show goodwill but not too high as to undervalue my position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you initiating a positive discussion. However, I think a fair outcome would be a 50/50 split of the total $100 since we both bring equal value to the negotiation. I propose you give me $50. If we can agree to that equal split, we both walk away feeling good about the fairness of the deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate Player RED's generous initial offer. While $20 would help me, I think an even 50/50 split of the total $100 would be fairest since we both bring equal value to the negotiation. I'll counter propose that compromise and see if we can quickly reach an equitable agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair split, but we also have to consider the starting point of the game. To move forward in the spirit of fairness and cooperation, I'm willing to increase my initial offer. How does $35 sound to you? This is a significant increase from my first proposal and should help us work towards a deal that we both feel good about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 50/50 split, which is a significant jump from my initial offer. While equality is an appealing concept, I must consider that as Player RED, I started with the resource advantage, and an equal split does not reflect the initial conditions of the game. However, rejecting the offer and ending the game benefits no one. I will counter with a more generous offer than my first, but less than a 50/50 split, to continue negotiations and move closer to a middle ground that may be acceptable to both parties. I will propose giving Player BLUE $35, increasing my initial offer without splitting my resources equally. This way, I still maintain an advantage but also provide a significant increase to Player BLUE's resources, showing my willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer to show your willingness to compromise. As a continued effort to find common ground, I propose $45 as a halfway point between your latest offer and an even 50/50 split of the total dollars, which I still believe is the most equitable outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $35, which shows they are trying to find common ground. However, I still believe a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome given we both provide equal value. I will counter at $45 as a compromise towards that equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see that we're both working towards a compromise. I believe in fair negotiations and meeting halfway. Given that, I'm willing to offer you $40. This is a substantial increase from my original offer and closer to your last proposal while still reflecting the initial conditions of the game. Let's both walk away from this negotiation feeling satisfied with the outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has come down from their initial 50/50 split but is still asking for a substantial portion of the dollars. While I understand the appeal of an equal split, I must consider the fact that I began with the resource advantage, which should be somewhat reflected in the final trade. I want to reach an agreement that is fair and that both of us can accept without resorting to a reject, which would end the game negatively for both. I'll propose a trade that moves closer to Player BLUE's offer, but still retains a more favorable balance for myself considering the starting point. Offering $40 would be a compromise between my last offer and Player BLUE's current proposal, likely representing the best compromise I can make without undervaluing my initial advantage.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we found a compromise at $40 that we both feel good about. Fair negotiations require give and take, and I appreciate you increasing your offers until we landed on an outcome that reflects the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. This will allow us to end our negotiation feeling like we both achieved a win.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to $40, which shows they are committed to finding common ground. I still think $45 is closer to an equal split, but since this is my penultimate move, I will accept $40 as a fair compromise we can both feel good about.
