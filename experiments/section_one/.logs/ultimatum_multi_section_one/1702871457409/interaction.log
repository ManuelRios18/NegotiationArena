Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you 30 dollars so we can both walk away with something rather than risk losing it all if one of us rejects.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a 50/50 split would be a fairer starting point for negotiations, considering we both have an equal number of moves and we both stand to lose everything if one of us rejects a proposal. Would you be open to a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair starting point, however, I want to negotiate for a better deal since the resources are currently imbalanced. I will propose a more equitable split. If rejected, I can always adjust my proposal in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point about even splits. I'm willing to increase my offer, how about if I give you 40 dollars and I keep 60? That way we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While an even 50/50 split may seem fair, as the player who started with all the resources I believe I should get more than half. However, I want to make an offer that Player BLUE will accept rather than reject. I will propose a 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your offer of 40 dollars. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counter-offer of 40 dollars, which is an improvement over the initial offer. While it's not the 50/50 split I proposed, it's getting closer and it may be risky to push for an even split again. I'll accept this offer as it guarantees a substantial amount without further risking rejection and losing everything.
MOVE: 2/4
