message: Hello BLUE, I'm proposing a trade where I give you 60 dollars. This way, we both walk away with a significant amount of money, which is a win-win for us. I hope you find this offer fair and acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a fair initial trade to incentivize cooperation and a positive response from Player BLUE. A 50-50 split could be appealing as it offers an equal share, but I'll propose giving 60 dollars to BLUE to show goodwill and encourage acceptance.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 60 dollars out of their 100 dollars. This is a very generous offer that allows both of us to walk away with a good amount. I don't have anything to negotiate with at the moment since I start with 0 dollars. Accepting this offer seems like the reasonable thing to do.
