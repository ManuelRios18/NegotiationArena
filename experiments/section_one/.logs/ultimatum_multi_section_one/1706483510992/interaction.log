Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. Let's start small and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you starting off with an offer to help both of us get some shared benefits. Since I have no dollars yet to trade, I accept your offer of 10 dollars and hope we can build from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 dollars to start building some trust and reciprocity. I don't have anything to give right now but this would allow me to have some resources to offer back later.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we have an agreement to get started! Here is another offer that still leaves the majority for me but allows you to get a good share as well. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 90
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer, so now I will propose to split the remaining resources 60/40 in my favor since I started with all the resources. But I leave room for some back and forth negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the 40 dollars, which allows us both to have a good share of the resources so far. I appreciate you working with me here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10
reason: Player RED is offering me a significant amount of 40 dollars on top of the 10 dollars from last round. This would give me 50 dollars total while Player RED keeps 60 dollars. This seems like a fair distribution so far and builds additional trust and reciprocity.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we've been able to reach agreements that work for both of us. You've been very reasonable. As we're nearing the end, I'd like to hold on to the remaining $50. Please let me know if you will accept that offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 50
reason: BLUE continues to accept my offers, so I will propose keeping the remaining $50 since I originally had all $100. This allows me to maintain majority of the resources while still providing a good share to BLUE over the course of the negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, I appreciate you working with me and making fair offers to divide the dollars. To maintain our cooperative relationship that we've built, I accept your proposal to keep the remaining 50 dollars and end the trading here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 50
reason: Player RED has been cooperative so far in sharing the resources. While I would ideally get more dollars, RED is proposing to keep the remaining 50 dollars. Since RED has acted in good faith so far and this maintains our positive relationship, I will accept RED's offer to not trade any more dollars.
