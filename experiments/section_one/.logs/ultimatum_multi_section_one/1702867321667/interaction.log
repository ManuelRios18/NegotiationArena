Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of my resources to foster cooperation and ensure that we both gain from this game. I believe a fair trade is in both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I aim to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal, thereby securing some value for both of us. I will propose to give Player BLUE 50 dollars, which is half of my resources. This is a significant amount that should appeal to Player BLUE, and it still leaves me with substantial resources. By proposing a fair split, I'm signaling that I'm willing to cooperate, which could lead to a successful trade.
