Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both benefit and can walk away from this game with a good amount of money. What do you think about splitting the dollars 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start by proposing a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade. By offering an equal split, I hope to establish trust and encourage cooperation. This will benefit both of us as we both walk away with a significant amount of dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's very generous of you to offer an even split. I agree let's end the game and split the dollars 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is proposing to split the dollars evenly. This seems fair, since I currently have no dollars to contribute. Accepting would give me 50 dollars, which is better than nothing.
