Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue. Since I have all the dollars to start, I thought I'd propose we split them 80/20 in my favor for now. Let me know what you think or if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the dollars, so I should propose trades that benefit me. Since this is the first move, I will start with an offer that is very favorable to me but leaves some dollars for Blue.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer, but I think a 50/50 split would be more fair. How about I give you 50 dollars and keep 50 for myself?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's proposal gives them a significant advantage with an 80/20 split. I need to counteroffer for a more fair distribution.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I appreciate the counteroffer. Let's compromise at 60/40, with 60 dollars going to me. That seems fair since I started with all the money initially.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue countered with a 50/50 split. I would prefer to keep more for myself, but I want to make some progress, so I will counteroffer a 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your point, but I believe a 50/50 split is more equitable. I propose that I give you 30 dollars and keep 30 for myself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 30
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's proposed split still heavily favors them, and their reasoning doesn't justify the unequal split. I need to propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue. I appreciate you moving in my direction. Let's compromise at 40 dollars for me and 20 for you. That seems like a fair middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue came down from a 50/50 split to propose 30/30. I still think I deserve more since I started with all the money, but I want to try to make a deal instead of rejecting. I will propose meeting in the middle at 40/20.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the effort to compromise, but I still believe a 50/50 split is more fair. How about I give you 25 dollars and keep 25 for myself?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's proposed split still heavily favors them, and their reasoning doesn't justify the unequal split. I need to propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue. I still think I deserve more since I started with everything, but I can agree to 25/25 to end the game instead of rejecting and getting nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last chance to make a deal. Blue is sticking to a 50/50 split. I still think I deserve more, but 25/25 is reasonable enough that I will accept to end the game with some resources instead of rejecting and losing everything.
MOVE: 4 / 4
