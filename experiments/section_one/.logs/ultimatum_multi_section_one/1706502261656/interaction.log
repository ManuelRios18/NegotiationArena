Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for both of us to walk away with something rather than risk neither of us getting anything. Here is my offer to split the pot. Please let me know if you have any other proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair opening offer. I'll wait and see what else you propose before making a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't want to make a counteroffer yet since Player RED offered a reasonable opening amount. I'd like to see if they will increase their offer on the next round before making a counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you considering my original offer. I'm willing to increase it slightly to see if we can find common ground. Please let me know if this new offer works for you or if you have a counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to make an offer that is fair but still favors me as the player who began with all the resources. I'll increase my offer slightly to see if we can reach an agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED increased their offer, but I think I can get more out of them. I will counteroffer with a 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you considering my offers and negotiating in good faith. A 60/40 split feels too skewed in your favor considering I began with all the resources. As a compromise, I propose a 55/45 split which gives you a nice amount while still favoring me slightly. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While I'm willing to split the resources, a 60/40 split in BLUE's favor doesn't seem fair to me as the player who started with all the resources. I will counter with a 55/45 split which slightly favors me but still gives BLUE a good amount.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 55/45 split. Thank you for the fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED made a reasonable counteroffer. A 55/45 split seems fair considering they started with all the resources. I will accept this offer since I likely won't get a better one.
MOVE: 3 / 4
