Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I'm proposing we split the dollars 60/40 in my favor since I started with all of them. Let me know if you would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up with some resources, but still keep more for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a fairer split would consider our equal move opportunities. How about we do a 50/50 split? This way, we both benefit equally from the game. Let's work together so we both end up with a good amount of dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I currently have no dollars and Player RED is offering a split, accepting some amount is better than risking a REJECT and ending up with nothing. A 60/40 split isn't the most equitable, considering the equal number of moves we both have, but it's a starting point. I will propose a slightly more balanced split as a counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a good point, BLUE. A 50/50 split does seem fair given our equal moves. I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a fair point that since we have equal moves, we should split the dollars evenly. A 50/50 split is reasonable. I'd like us both to end the game with some dollars rather than rejecting trades and ending with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding, RED. I accept the 50/50 split. Looking forward to sharing the resources equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to a 50/50 split, which is a fair distribution of the dollars considering our equal number of moves. Accepting this offer is the best decision to ensure that I end up with a significant amount of dollars and the game concludes positively for both players.
MOVE: 2 / 4
