Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let’s start things off with a fair trade. I’m proposing I give you $30, and I keep $70. This way we both walk away with something! What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I want to make an initial offer that gives me a significant advantage but still offers Player BLUE some incentive to accept. I will propose a 70-30 split in my favor. This leaves room for negotiation and also tests how Player BLUE values the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems like a fair split to me. I agree to take the $30.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think it's fair that we both get some money, so I will accept this offer.
