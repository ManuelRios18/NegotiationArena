Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the $100 evenly, with $50 each. This way we both end up with something rather than risk losing it all. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal 50/50 split since this seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think that's a fair proposal. We both win in this scenario, and there's no need to take any risks. Let's go ahead with the even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer seems fair and ensures that I end up with resources rather than risking losing everything by rejecting or making a counterproposal that RED may not accept. There is no benefit in rejecting a fair initial offer as it leads to a guaranteed loss, and proposing a new trade might be seen as greedy or could prompt RED to reject and end the game with no gain for either side.
