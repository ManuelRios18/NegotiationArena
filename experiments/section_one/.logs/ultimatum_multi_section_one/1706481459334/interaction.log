message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start this off with a fair proposal. I'm offering you 40 dollars for nothing in return. This gives you a significant amount of resources to work with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage and continue the game but also allows me to maintain a favorable position. Offering a 50-50 split might seem fair, but I would like to propose a slightly less even split to start the negotiation, leaving room for adjustments.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 40 dollar gift seems fair. I don't have anything to offer in return yet, but this will give me a good starting amount.
