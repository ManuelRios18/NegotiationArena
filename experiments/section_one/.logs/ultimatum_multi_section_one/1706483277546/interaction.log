Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the opening offer. I'd like to propose a counteroffer: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. Let's try to find a fair middle ground. Here is a counter from me:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for more than I initially offered. I would like to try to find a fair middle ground. I will counter with a slightly higher amount from my initial offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your counteroffer. I'd like to propose another counter: Player RED Gives Dollars: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0. Let's see if we can find a balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is closer to my initial proposal, but I still have room to negotiate.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I accept your offer of 12. I think that allows us both to benefit fairly from this game. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down in their ask. I think 12 is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit. I'd like to lock this in rather than risk losing everything.
MOVE: 3 / 4
