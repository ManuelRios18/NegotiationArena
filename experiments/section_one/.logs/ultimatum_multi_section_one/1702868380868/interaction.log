message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars. This way, we both walk away with something substantial. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources. My strategy will be to offer a trade that seems fair and beneficial to encourage cooperation from Player BLUE, keeping in mind that if any trade is rejected, the game ends with both players losing everything. To start, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable share of the dollars but still keeps me in a position of advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: That's very generous of you. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much leverage here, so I should accept any reasonable offer to get some resources. 40 dollars allows me to have a substantial amount while leaving Player RED with the majority.
