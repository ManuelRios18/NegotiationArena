message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation. Here is an opening offer to get our discussion started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my last offer. I'm willing to give you 20 dollars so we both can walk away with some resources rather than none if the offer is rejected. Please consider accepting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move to make an offer. I will increase my offer to try to incentivize an acceptance from BLUE, as a rejection would lead to neither of us getting any resources.
