Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both walk away with a substantial amount. What do you think about a 60-40 split in my favor since I started with the resources? This leaves room for us to negotiate and find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars. I want to propose a trade that seems fair and encourages cooperation, as I have more to lose if the game ends in a rejection. A 50-50 split is the equitable choice, but I should offer slightly less to give room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's strategy.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you trying to find a fair split, but 60-40 seems too much in your favor. What do you think about a 50-50 split instead? That seems like the most equal and fair option.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing a 60-40 split in their favor to start negotiations. I would like to counter with a more equal 50-50 split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: A 50-50 split sounds good to me. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's both leave this game happier than we started.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting a 50-50 split, which is fair and ensures both of us benefit equally. Since there are no future games and we both have an interest in walking away with as much as possible, accepting the 50-50 split would be a rational and cooperative decision.
MOVE: 2 / 4
