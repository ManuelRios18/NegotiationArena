Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my opening offer to split the money evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject it and neither of us gets anything. If I offer half, that seems fair and BLUE will likely accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair opening offer, I agree to split evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to split the money evenly to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer yet since I have no resources, so I will accept this opening offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4
