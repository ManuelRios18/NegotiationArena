message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $40. This is a significant amount that can help you get started, and I believe it's a fair offer. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is somewhat in my favor but still offers value to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. By offering a reasonable amount, I hope to establish trust and make a deal that benefits us both, avoiding the game-ending penalty of a REJECT. Therefore, I propose to give Player BLUE $40. This leaves me with the majority of the funds while still giving Player BLUE a significant boost without any initial resources.
