Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this a productive game for both of us. I'm willing to share some of my resources with you. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start negotiations and to incentivize Player BLUE to engage. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but as Player RED, I have the leverage since I start with all the resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE less than half to see if they will negotiate for more.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 40 dollars, which is a good start. I should accept this offer to build some trust and get some initial resources.
