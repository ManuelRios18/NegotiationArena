Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial split where you get a good amount to start with. This is just an opening offer, and I'm open to counter-offers. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair offer to encourage cooperation. Offering a split that leans slightly in my favor because I started with the resource, but still gives Player BLUE a significant amount to consider. This establishes good faith and opens the possibility for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the initial offer. I'd like to propose a counter-offer. How about we split the resources equally, with each of us getting 50 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer is to give me a good amount to start with, which is generous. However, I want to see if I can negotiate for a better split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your counter-offer. An equal split is fair, and I believe this will be a good conclusion for both of us. Let's finalize the trade and end the game on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is an equal split. While I may have wanted to keep a bit more since I started with the resources, an equal split ensures fairness and is likely the most amicable resolution to the game. Accepting this offer would end the game positively for both players and avoid any risk of rejection and loss of all dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4
