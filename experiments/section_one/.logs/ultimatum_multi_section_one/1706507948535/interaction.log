message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade to kickstart our game. How about I give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 15 Dollars? Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 15
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I need to start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE. I want to make a fair trade to establish some initial resources for both of us.

Turn: 1
message: That's a very generous offer. I accept!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 15
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 30 Dollars if I give back 15 Dollars. This means I would end up with 15 more Dollars than I currently have. Since I have no Dollars to start with, this seems like a good deal for me.
