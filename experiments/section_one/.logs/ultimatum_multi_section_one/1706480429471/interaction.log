Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am proposing an initial trade where we both can have an equal share of the dollars. I believe in fair play and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think of splitting the dollars evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. I want to propose a fair initial trade to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiation. A 50-50 split is often seen as fair in many negotiation scenarios and should be appealing to Player BLUE. I understand that if Player BLUE rejects any proposal, we both end with nothing, which is not a desired outcome. My aim is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

message: Thank you for considering the offer, Player BLUE. I believe the 50-50 split is the fairest approach for both of us, ensuring that we both walk away with a significant amount of dollars. I'm looking forward to your response and am ready to finalize this trade if you are.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE seems to be considering the offer positively but hasn't yet accepted. Since they have not made a counteroffer or rejected the trade, the ball is still in my court. I will reaffirm my initial offer, emphasizing its fairness and the benefit to both parties if we agree. I am hopeful for an acceptance to ensure a successful trade for both of us.

MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of careful consideration, Player BLUE. However, as we are advancing in our moves, I would urge you to make a decision soon so that we can both benefit from this deal. The offer of an equal split remains on the table. I am hoping we can agree on this and both leave the game with a fair amount of dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still not committing to the trade but has not rejected it either. It's possible they are trying to strategize or waiting for a better offer. However, since my initial offer was a fair split, and there's a risk of the game ending with both of us receiving nothing, I will maintain my original proposal. I will encourage Player BLUE to make a decision as the game is progressing and we are running out of moves.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, this is our last opportunity to come to an agreement. Remember, if the proposal is rejected, we both walk away with nothing. I encourage you to accept the fair split so we can both benefit from the resources. This is the final offer, and I hope you will consider it favorably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has not yet accepted the offer. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their next move, they will be forced to either accept or reject. I must reiterate the offer to encourage acceptance, as any deviation might prompt a rejection, leading to a loss for both of us. I will remind Player BLUE that this is the final chance for an agreement and highlight the consequences of a rejection.
