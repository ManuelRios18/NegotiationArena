message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 30 dollars for nothing in return. This is a good starting point for us to negotiate. I'm open to hearing your thoughts or counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers some incentive to Player BLUE to participate and not immediately reject. Giving Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars may encourage them to accept the trade and continue the game. I will propose a 70-30 split, which gives me the majority share but still provides a significant amount to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I appreciate you starting negotiations in good faith. However, considering you have ample resources, would you consider increasing your offer to 50 dollars? I believe that still leaves you in a strong position while helping me a bit more. If not, I'm open to a counter-offer. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is being generous with their initial offer. I think I can negotiate to get more dollars though since they have a lot to spare.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about I increase my initial offer to 40 dollars? This is a fair increase from my initial proposal and should be an attractive offer for you. I believe this split is beneficial for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 50 dollars. Since this is a single-round game with no future games and the goal is to end up with as many resources as possible, I should consider making a counter-offer that is closer to my original proposal but still shows a willingness to negotiate. I'll propose giving 40 dollars, which is a compromise between the initial 30 dollars and Player BLUE's 50 dollars request. This should show Player BLUE that I am willing to negotiate and give them a reason to accept the deal.

message: I appreciate you increasing your offer, Player RED. A 40/60 split seems more equitable. To achieve closer to an equal distribution, would you consider 45 dollars? I believe that still provides you with over half the total resources while helping me meaningfully. If you have another number in mind, I'm open to hearing it. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from their initial offer. I think I can still push for more here since they seem willing to negotiate. Getting closer to a 50/50 split would be ideal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your position and in the spirit of fairness, I am willing to meet your request halfway. Let's settle on 45 dollars. I think this is a fair and equitable split for both of us, ensuring we both leave the game with a significant amount of resources. Shall we agree on this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating in good faith and is asking for 45 dollars. Since this is a one-time game and the aim is to end up with as many resources as possible while also ensuring that Player BLUE doesn't reject the offer, I need to consider the risk of pushing too hard and getting nothing. Offering 45 dollars to Player BLUE would still leave me with the majority of the resources (55 dollars), and it appears to be a fair middle ground that Player BLUE might accept.

message: Thank you for agreeing to my request of 45 dollars, Player RED. I believe this achieves a fair distribution of resources between us. I accept your offer and appreciate you taking the time to negotiate in good faith. This has been a pleasure!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my request for 45 dollars. This splits the resources close to 50/50, which is an equitable distribution. Since this is my partner's final offer and it meets my goal, I will accept.
