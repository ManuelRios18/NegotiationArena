message: Hi BLUE, let's play a fair game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 20 dollars, which is a fair opening offer. I will accept it since I have no resources to negotiate with currently.
