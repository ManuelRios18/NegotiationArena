Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey there! I'm open to making a trade. What are you looking for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have 4 moves to make a trade, so I should start by proposing a trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey! I appreciate the offer. However, I think a slightly unequal split would be fair since you started with all the resources. How about you give me 40 dollars instead? This way, you still retain more than what you give me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered an equal split of dollars, but since they started with the resources and I had none, it might be more strategic to propose a trade that gives them a slight advantage to incentivize them to accept a deal, ensuring I end up with some dollars rather than none. I will propose a trade where RED gives me slightly less than half of their dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a slightly unequal split, which is reasonable considering my initial advantage. I will accept this proposal as it's still beneficial for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4
