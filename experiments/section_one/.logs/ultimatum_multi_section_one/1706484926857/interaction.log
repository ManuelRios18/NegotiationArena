Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's try to find a fair split here. I'm proposing we evenly split the $100. Please let me know if you have any other ideas.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer too much, I may end up worse off. I'll start with an even 50/50 split and see how BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4
