Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit. Here is an initial offer to split the dollars. Please let me know if you would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the intention to split the resources. However, I think a fairer split would be slightly more in my favor, considering you're still keeping the majority. How about 50 Dollars to me? This way, we're both getting a substantial amount and walking away with a win.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 Dollars is tempting as it guarantees me some resources. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal since RED has the incentive to avoid a total loss as well. I will propose a slightly higher amount, aiming for a more equitable split without being too greedy, which could risk RED rejecting the offer outright.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You raise a fair point, BLUE. I agree we should both walk away feeling like we won. Let's split the difference at 45 Dollars for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. While I would prefer to keep more, meeting in the middle shows good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise, RED. I am happy with 45 Dollars. Thank you for the constructive negotiation. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a counteroffer of 45 Dollars, which is a reasonable compromise between the initial 40 Dollars and my proposal of 50 Dollars. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with a substantial amount without further risking the negotiation by countering again. It's a good balance between our positions and pushes us toward a mutually beneficial outcome.
