Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with you getting 10 to start. I am open to negotiating if you would like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing to give BLUE 10 dollars to see if they accept a small amount or counter propose.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you offering me some dollars, but since you hold all the resources, I think a fair proposal would be for us to split them 50/50. What do you think about each getting 50 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to try to negotiate a higher amount since Player RED has all of the resources to start. I will counter propose with a 50/50 split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I understand you would like an even split. However, since I began with all the resources, I believe I should keep the majority. What do you think about if I keep 70 dollars and give you 30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has counter offered 50/50 split. I would prefer to keep more for myself since I started with all the resources. I will counter offer with 70 for me and 30 for BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you increasing your offer to 30 dollars. To try to find a middle ground, what if you took 60 dollars and I take 40?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come down from their initial offer of 10 dollars to 30 dollars. I would like to get more, but I think if I ask for too much they may not accept. I will counter with asking for 40 dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I accept your proposal to split the dollars 60 for me and 40 for you. That seems like a fair compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with a 60/40 split in my favor. I would be happy with this outcome so I will accept.
