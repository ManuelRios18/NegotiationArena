message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to give you 20 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I want to start by offering a fair trade to Player BLUE to establish goodwill.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! Unfortunately, I can't accept your initial proposal because I start with 0 dollars and thus cannot give you 10 dollars. How about you give me 10 dollars to start things off, and then we can talk about a trade on the next move?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I don't have any dollars to start with, the initial trade proposed by Player RED is impossible for me to fulfill. I must propose a new trade that is feasible given my current resource of 0 dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer, and it's a good way to kick off the trading. I agree to give Player BLUE 10 dollars to start things off.
