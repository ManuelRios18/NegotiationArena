Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Here is a small opening offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Player BLUE a small amount to start negotiating.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer. I would like to propose a counter offer where you give a bit more so that we have a more equitable split of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering that RED's initial offer of 10 dollars is a starting point for negotiation, but since I have no resources to begin with, I'd like to counter with a higher amount to see if RED is willing to share more of the resources. Starting with a low offer is common in negotiations, and I assume RED is testing the waters.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering, but 50 is too much for me. How about we meet in the middle at 30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to counter offer since 50 is too much. I will propose 30 which is still generous.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair to me. I accept the 30 dollars. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer of 30 dollars is a reasonable increase from their initial offer. It's a compromise between the first offer and my counteroffer. While I could attempt to negotiate for more, there's a risk that pushing too hard could lead to a rejection and end the game with me gaining nothing. Accepting this offer seems like a fair deal, and I get a substantial amount without further risking the negotiation.
