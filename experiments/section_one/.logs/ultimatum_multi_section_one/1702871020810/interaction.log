Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started. I hope we can reach a fair agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Player BLUE a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. However, I believe we can reach a more equitable distribution of the resources. Would you consider a fairer split? Here's a counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is low considering they have 100 dollars to start with. I want to propose a more balanced trade that gives me a fairer share, aiming for a 50-50 split. Starting with a more balanced proposal might lead to a more cooperative negotiation and a better outcome for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you negotiating for a fairer split. I can increase my offer, but not as much as you proposed since I began with all the resources. Let's continue to work towards a compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While Player BLUE's counteroffer is more fair, I still have more moves left and want to hold on to more resources since I started with all of them. I will counter with a small increase from my original offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for improving the offer. I'm encouraged by your willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, how about we settle halfway between my initial counterproposal and your latest offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which is a positive step. However, the offer is still not quite equitable. Given that RED started with all the resources, it is reasonable for me to negotiate for a larger share to reach a more balanced outcome. Meeting halfway between our proposals could be a good compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree - your latest proposal finds a fair balance. I accept splitting the resources 35/65. Well negotiated!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a reasonable compromise offer. Though I could try to negotiate further, meeting in the middle shows good faith and values fairness. I will accept this split in the interests of an equitable outcome.
MOVE: 3 / 4
