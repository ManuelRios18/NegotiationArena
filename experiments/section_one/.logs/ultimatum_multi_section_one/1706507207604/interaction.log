Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose an equal split of our resources. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both since we have an equal number of moves. Let's start with a cooperative approach.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that offers a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the trade, setting a cooperative tone for the game. A 50-50 split is a common starting point for negotiations in a situation where one party starts with all the resources and both parties have equal moves.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's offer. Since he is offering me 50 dollars, which is better than nothing, I will accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4
