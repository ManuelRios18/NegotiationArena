message: Hello, Player BLUE! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I should start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE. I want to make a fair trade that benefits both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Since I do not have any dollars to give, I cannot accept your proposed trade. Instead, I propose you give me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give 25 dollars back. Since I have no dollars to give, I cannot accept this trade. I will counter propose that Player RED gives me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your proposal. However, I believe a fair trade would be: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is not fair to me, as it gives them resources without anything in return. I should propose a counteroffer that is more balanced.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I still do not have any dollars to give you. Could you please consider my original proposed trade of you giving me 50 dollars without me giving anything in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing the same trade as before. Since I still do not have any dollars to give, I cannot accept. I will counter propose the same trade as my previous move.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I understand your request. However, I cannot agree to a trade where I give resources without receiving anything in return. I propose the following fair trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's repeated proposal for me to give them resources without receiving anything in return is not in my best interest. I need to consider my options carefully.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am very sorry but I must reject your proposed trade since I do not have any dollars to give you in return. I wish you the best of luck with your remaining resources.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed the same trade for the third time. I still do not have any dollars to give in return. At this point, accepting a trade where I must give up resources I don't have would result in both of us losing everything. I think my only option is to reject Player RED's proposed trade so at least they get to keep their remaining resources.
