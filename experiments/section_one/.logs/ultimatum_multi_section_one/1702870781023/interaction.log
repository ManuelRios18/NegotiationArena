message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade.

my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.

message: 
Hello Player RED. I unfortunately don't have any dollars to give you right now. Could you propose a trade where I don't have to give up any resources? Once I acquire some dollars from you, I can start giving some back in future trades.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 
Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give them 25 dollars. Since I currently have 0 dollars, I cannot actually give them 25 dollars. I should try to negotiate a trade where I don't have to give up any resources since I don't have any to give.

message: Sure, I understand. Let's start with a trade where you don't have to give up any resources. Here's my proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE doesn't have any dollars to trade, so I will propose a trade where Player BLUE doesn't have to give up any resources. This will allow Player BLUE to start acquiring resources for future trades.

message: 
Thank you for the generous offer Player RED! I accept.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 
Player RED has proposed to give me 25 dollars without asking for anything in return. This is a good deal for me since I get resources without having to give any up. I should accept this trade.
