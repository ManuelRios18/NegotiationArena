Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking a total loss.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars. I aim to propose a trade that is fair and leaves both players better off than a rejection, but that still leverages my initial advantage. I will propose giving 40 dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, leaving me with a majority of the funds but still sharing a significant portion with Player BLUE. This should be an attractive offer for Player BLUE, as they start with no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have anything to offer in return yet, so I will accept Player RED's generous offer. This gets me started with some resources to negotiate with on future turns.
