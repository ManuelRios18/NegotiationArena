Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars so we both get some resources. Please let me know if you'd accept this or would like to propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up with something, but keep most for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks RED, I accept your offer of 20 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED gives me a positive balance without risking an immediate end of the game. Since there are no future games and my current balance is zero, gaining any amount is beneficial. Accepting the offer also allows for further negotiation in subsequent moves, potentially increasing my gains.
