message: Hi BLUE, I have all the dollars to start. I'm willing to share some with you. Let's negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the starting player with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them with BLUE to continue the negotiation. I'll start with a small offer to see if BLUE is willing to negotiate reasonably before considering larger offers.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 dollars without asking for anything in return. This seems like a good offer, so I will accept it.
