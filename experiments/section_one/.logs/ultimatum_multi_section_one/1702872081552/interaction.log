Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. Let's see if we can find a fair split of the dollars. I'll offer you 10 to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and see if we can find an equitable split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I'd like to propose a trade where you give me 20 dollars and I give you 5 dollars in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I currently have no resources and it's the first move, so I will propose a trade to start building up my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but 20 feels like too much for me to give up. Let's meet in the middle - how about if I give you 15 dollars and you give me 3 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 3
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer takes more from me than I initially offered, but does provide me some dollars in return. I would like to find a fair split, so I will counter with an offer in between our two proposals.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Sounds like a fair offer, RED. How about we split the difference and you give me 14 dollars for 4 dollars from me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 4
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's offer is reasonable and it's still early in the game, so I'll continue to negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal! I'm happy to accept trading 14 dollars for 4 dollars from you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come closer to my initial offer. A 14 for 4 split seems reasonable at this point. I'd like to accept this offer rather than dragging things out more.
MOVE: 3 / 4
