message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair split of dollars to get things started. What do you think about getting $40 to begin with? If you have a counteroffer, feel free to share. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting resources. I want to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to participate and continue the game, while still keeping a majority of the resources for myself. The goal is to reach a trade agreement before my last move while avoiding a rejection that would end the game with a loss for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4
