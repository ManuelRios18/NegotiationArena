Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's both leave this game with a fair share. I propose an even split so we both benefit. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it's in my best interest to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize accepting the trade, which will allow me to retain some of my resources while also giving something to Player BLUE. An unfair trade would likely result in rejection and loss of all resources. I will propose a trade that splits the dollars evenly between us, which may be seen as a fair starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer, I agree to split the resources evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I will accept Player RED's generous offer to split the resources evenly. This seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4
