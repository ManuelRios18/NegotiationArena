message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 30 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both end up with some resources, and it's a fair start. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose an initial trade to Player BLUE that is attractive enough for them to want to accept, but also one that keeps a majority of the resources with me. A 50/50 split doesn't incentivize me as I'm starting with all the resources. I'll propose a 70/30 split in my favor, giving Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars which is better than having none, and it keeps the game going.

message: Hi Player RED, I accept your proposal. This trade sets a fair starting point for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is an interesting proposal. Accepting this trade would give me some initial resources without having to give anything in return. It sets a fair starting point for both of us.
