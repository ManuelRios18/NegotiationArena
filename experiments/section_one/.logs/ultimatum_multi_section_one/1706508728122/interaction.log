message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I would like to propose a trade. How about I give you 30 dollars in exchange for 15 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 15
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I want to propose a fair trade to start the game.
MOVE: 1/4

message: Hello Player RED, I see you have proposed a trade where I would need to give you 15 dollars, but I currently have no dollars to trade. Let's adjust the terms. How about you give me a smaller amount to start with, and then we can discuss a trade involving that sum on the next move?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposal by Player RED does not make sense as I start with zero dollars to trade. In response, Iâ€™ll propose a more reasonable trade that allows me to gain some dollars without giving anything up this round, as I have nothing to give. This could help in establishing good faith and a more cooperative dynamic for future trades.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the adjustment. I accept the new proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has suggested adjusting the terms of the trade, which seems reasonable. I'll go with the new proposal to give 10 dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing. This sets the stage for potential future trades.
MOVE: 1/4
