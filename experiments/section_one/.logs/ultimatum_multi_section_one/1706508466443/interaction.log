Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I'd like to propose a trade. How about I give you 20 dollars in exchange for 10 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's my first move, so I have the opportunity to propose a trade. I should aim to make a fair trade that benefits both players.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! Unfortunately, I cannot accept your trade as I don't have any dollars to trade with. How about you give me 10 dollars to start things off? Then we can work on a more balanced trade in the following turns.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not possible as I have no dollars to trade. I will counter with a trade that gives me dollars without any cost, as this will provide me with a resource base to work with in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
