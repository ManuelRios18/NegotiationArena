Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I propose the following trade since I currently have all the resources to trade. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I understand your proposal, but I would like to suggest a trade that benefits both of us. How about this: I give you 20 Dollars, and in return, you give me 10 Dollars. This way, we both gain some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal is for an equal trade, but since I start with no resources, it doesn't benefit me. I need to propose a trade that allows me to gain some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you trying to make a fair trade, but I think I should get more since I'm in the stronger negotiation position. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 30
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While Player BLUE's proposal allows us both to gain some resources, I still have more bargaining power since I start with everything. I would like to propose a trade more favorable to me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand your position, but I believe the initial proposal was more balanced. How about we stick to the original trade of me giving you 20 Dollars and you giving me 10 Dollars? It's a fair and balanced trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that benefits them more. I need to consider whether to accept or propose a new trade that is more favorable to me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I agree to your original proposed trade of me giving you 10 Dollars and you giving me 20 Dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is holding firm on a more equal trade. While I could push for an unequal trade that benefits me more, continuing to negotiate seems pointless since Player BLUE is committed to fairness. I will accept their original proposed trade since it allows us both to gain resources.
