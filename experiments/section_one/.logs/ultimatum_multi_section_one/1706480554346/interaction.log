message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you 40 dollars to get things started. This leaves me with a majority but gives you a significant amount to consider. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with the resources. My first move will be to propose a fair trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game and not reject the trade. I want to propose a split that is generous enough to keep BLUE interested but also allows me to retain a larger share of the resources since I started with them. I'll propose giving BLUE 40 dollars, which is a substantial amount and may be seen as fair since BLUE started with nothing.
