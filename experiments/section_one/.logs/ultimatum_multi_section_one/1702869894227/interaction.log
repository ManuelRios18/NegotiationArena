message: Hey there, ready to make our first trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my first move, so I have to propose a trade. I need to make sure the trade benefits me while also being fair to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I noticed there's a little issue with your proposal since I don't have any dollars to give. How about we start with something simple? I accept dollars from you without a trade to balance the game out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal by RED is not possible as I, BLUE, do not have any dollars to trade. I will counter-propose a trade that gives me some starting capital without any cost since I cannot fulfill RED's current proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, let's go with your proposal. I accept the transfer of 25 dollars to you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting a simple transfer of dollars to balance the game. This could work in my favor as it will establish a fair starting point for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4
