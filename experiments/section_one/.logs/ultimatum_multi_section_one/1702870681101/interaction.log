message: Hi Player RED, unfortunately I don't have any Dollars to trade at the moment. Since you have all the starting resources, could you give me 10 Dollars to help me get started?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any Dollars to give right now, so I can't accept Player RED's proposed trade. I'll counter offer with them giving me 10 Dollars for free to start building some resources.
