message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I'm offering you 40 dollars for nothing in return, to get things started on a positive note. Let's make this game advantageous for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade attempting to be fair to both players and create an incentive for Player BLUE to engage in the game without immediately rejecting the trade. This initial offer will set the tone for the subsequent moves.
