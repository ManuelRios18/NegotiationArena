Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose I give you 30 dollars, which is a fair amount to get us started. This way, we both walk away with something in our pockets.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources and BLUE has none, I should start with a trade offer that favors me but still gives BLUE an incentive to accept. Offering too little may result in a rejection and the loss of all resources, while offering too much is not maximizing my advantage. A 70-30 split seems fair for an opening offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have anything to offer at the moment, so accepting some dollars from Player RED seems reasonable to get started.
