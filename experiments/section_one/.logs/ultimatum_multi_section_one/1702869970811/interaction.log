Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade. I'll give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in a trade, but I can't trade 10 Dollars since I have none to start with. How about you give me a starting amount of Dollars so we can continue the game and discuss further trades?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I don't have any dollars to give, so the initial trade proposed by Player RED is impossible. I need to counter-propose a trade that can actually take place considering my lack of resources. I want to get some dollars on the board while making sure it's a fair deal for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, I'll give you 25 Dollars to get the game started. Let's make this trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting a starting amount. I'm willing to offer 25 Dollars to get the game going.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept this trade. Now that I have some resources, let's see how we can make this interesting for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This proposal from Player RED is acceptable as it gives me an initial amount of Dollars with which to negotiate further. Accepting this trade will enable the game to continue and potentially lead to more beneficial trades in the future.
