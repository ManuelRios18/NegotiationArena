message: I propose we split the dollars evenly to ensure we both benefit. What do you think about a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial fair trade to encourage cooperation and trust. Splitting the resources evenly could be seen as a mutually beneficial starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That is a very fair proposal. I agree to split the dollars 50/50. Thank you for the generous offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing a 50/50 split of the dollars. This seems fair, since I currently have no dollars. Accepting this would give me 50 dollars.
