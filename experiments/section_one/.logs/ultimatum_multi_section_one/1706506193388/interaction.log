message: Hi BLUE, I propose we split the dollars equally. This way, we both benefit fairly from the trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm initiating the game with a proposal that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game, but also keeps a majority of the resources with me, as I'm the one starting with all the resources. I will suggest a 50-50 split to show goodwill and set a cooperative tone, hoping this leads to an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4
