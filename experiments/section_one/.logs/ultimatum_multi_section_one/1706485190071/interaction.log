message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars 60/40 in your favor since I started with all of them. Please let me know if you would like to adjust this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them somewhat evenly to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That offer sounds fair. I agree to split the dollars 60 for me and 40 for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think a 60/40 split is reasonable since Player RED started with all the resources. I will accept this offer.
