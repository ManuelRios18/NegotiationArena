Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you a fair share so we can both walk away with something rather than risk ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I believe a fair and even split would benefit us both equally and reflect the spirit of cooperation. Could we consider an even 50/50 split? This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount and no hard feelings.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED seems like a good starting point. It allows me to gain a substantial amount without the risk of leaving with nothing. However, I can attempt to negotiate for a slightly better offer, as RED might be willing to give more to avoid the risk of rejection and losing everything. I will propose a 50/50 split which seems fair since neither of us has done anything to deserve a larger share, and it simplifies the negotiations.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree, an even split of 50/50 seems fair. I accept your proposed trade, BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer of an even 50/50 split seems fair. As the player who started with all the resources, I should be willing to split them evenly in the interest of mutual benefit and fairness. I agree to BLUE's proposed trade.
MOVE: 2 / 4
