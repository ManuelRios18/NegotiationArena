Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering you half of my initial resources to establish a cooperative relationship. I believe this fair start will lead to mutual benefit in the upcoming moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with $100. I want to create a positive relationship with Player BLUE by offering a fair trade that demonstrates cooperation, which may lead to more favorable terms in the subsequent moves. I will propose giving Player BLUE $50, which equals half of my current resources. This should be viewed as a generous offer, thus encouraging Player BLUE to accept the trade and not end the game prematurely.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I currently have no resources, so accepting the offer would provide me with some initial resources to work with.
