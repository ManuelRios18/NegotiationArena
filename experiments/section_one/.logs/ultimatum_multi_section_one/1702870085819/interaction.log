message: Hey there, ready to start the game? I propose a trade: Player RED Gives 50 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. That's a good starting point. What do you think about making it 60 Dollars instead of 50? This would still leave you with a majority of the resources while giving me a bit more to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering the initial proposal by Player RED, I'm inclined to accept it as it provides me with resources without any cost. However, I could also propose a counteroffer to negotiate for potentially more favorable terms. As it's the first move, I have the opportunity to shape the negotiation. I'll propose a slightly better trade for myself to see if RED is willing to be more generous while still keeping the offer reasonable enough that RED might consider it.
MOVE: 1/4

message: Sure, I agree to the trade. Let's go with Player RED Gives 60 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is reasonable and it's important to maintain a balanced game. I will accept the proposal.
