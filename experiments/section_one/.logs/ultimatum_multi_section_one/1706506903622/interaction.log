Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. I propose splitting the dollars evenly. This way, we both benefit and can end the game on a positive note. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose an initial trade that offers a reasonable split of the resources. By offering Player BLUE a fair portion of the dollars, I aim to incentivize them to accept the trade and ensure that both of us end up with a positive outcome. Starting with a 50-50 split as an opening offer is a common and fair practice in negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair trade, I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can't make a counteroffer. I will accept Player RED's offer to split the dollars evenly since that seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4
