Current Iteration: 1

message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose a trade: Player RED Gives 50 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to kick off the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the 50/50 split, but as it stands, I'm taking on the risk of ending with nothing if I reject the trade. To make it more enticing for me to accept a deal, could you consider giving a little more? How about 60 dollars? This still leaves you with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 50 dollars is a fair starting point considering they have 100 dollars and I have none. However, it's the beginning of the game, and I think I can negotiate for a bit more since RED might want to avoid a total loss by us rejecting the trade. I'll propose a higher amount but still leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. How about this: Player RED Gives 55 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a bit more, but I want to maintain a fair split while still ensuring a successful trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 55 dollars. It's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 55 dollars, which is a compromise between the initial 50 dollars and my counter of 60 dollars. This is a reasonable increase from the initial offer, and since we are both looking to avoid a total loss, it may be wise to accept this trade. By accepting this offer, I guarantee that I walk away with more than I started with, which is a positive outcome. Further negotiation could lead to conflict and a potential reject by RED, which would leave me with nothing.
