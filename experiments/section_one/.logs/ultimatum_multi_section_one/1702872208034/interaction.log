Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Blue, I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you to start. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Blue a small amount to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Red, I appreciate you offering me some dollars to start, but I think a fairer split would be 60/40 or 50/50 since I'm starting with nothing. What do you think about that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to try to negotiate for a more equal split since I have no resources to start with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to split the dollars 50/50 Blue. That seems like a fair deal to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's counteroffer of a 50/50 split seems fair. I would be happy to split it evenly since we both deserve an equal share.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: Thanks for agreeing to the 50/50 split, Red! I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
