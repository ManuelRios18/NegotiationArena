------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources 60/40 in my favor for now. I am open to negotiating further though.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think a fairer split would benefit us both since we both have equal moves. How about we go for an even 50/50 split? That way, we both walk away with a substantial amount and it's a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has proposed a 60/40 split in their favor. Given that I have no resources to begin with, accepting this offer gives me resources I didn't have before. However, I would like to negotiate for a more favorable split. Proposing a counter-offer could lead to a better outcome for me, as there is room for negotiation and RED seems open to it. I'll aim for an even 50/50 split or something slightly more in my favor, as RED has the advantage of having all the initial resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point, BLUE. A 50/50 split seems reasonable. Let's proceed with your proposal and end the game here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer of a 50/50 split is reasonable. As the player who currently has all the resources, accepting a fair split strengthens trust and goodwill between us. And since there are no future rounds, maximizing my own payout at BLUE's expense could unnecessarily create conflict. I think accepting the even split sets us up both to walk away feeling good about the interaction.
MOVE: 2 / 4
