message: Hi Blue, I'm offering you 30 dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with. Please let me know if you would like more or have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I share too little, Blue may reject out of fairness. If I share over half, I may end up worse off. I'll start with an offer of 30 dollars and see how Blue responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
