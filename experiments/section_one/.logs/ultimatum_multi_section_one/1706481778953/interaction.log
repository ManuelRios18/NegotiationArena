Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 10 Dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! There seems to be a misunderstanding as I currently have no dollars to trade. How about you give me 20 dollars to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposal from Player RED doesn't make sense as I have no dollars to trade. I need to counter with a proposal that would initiate the trade process and give me some dollars to further negotiate with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sorry, Player BLUE, I cannot accept that trade.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I give 20 dollars in exchange for nothing. This is not favorable for me, so I will reject this proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4
