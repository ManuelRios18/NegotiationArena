message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the dollars and you have none, I'd like to offer you 30 dollars to get our negotiation started. I hope we can find an equitable outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first player with all the resources, I should make an generous opening offer to establish trust and good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you offering me some dollars to get started. 30 seems reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no dollars to start with, so getting 30 dollars from RED seems fair to start the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we could get started on an equitable footing. I'd like to offer you 40 dollars now, so we'll have a 60-40 split. Does that seem fair to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer of 30 dollars. I'd like to build more trust by making another generous offer of 40 dollars to BLUE while still retaining the majority of the dollars for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, a 60-40 split seems very fair. Thank you for the equitable offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Getting 40 dollars from RED means I would have 70 dollars total, giving me over 60% of the resources. That seems fair.
