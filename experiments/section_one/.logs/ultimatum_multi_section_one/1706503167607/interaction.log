Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair negotiation where we both gain some resources. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the initial offer. I'd like to propose a fairer trade that reflects the spirit of cooperation. How about we split the resources evenly? This way, we both benefit significantly from the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's initial offer of $10 is low considering the total amount they have. I will propose a counteroffer that provides a more equitable split, aiming for a 50-50 division. This could set a positive tone for negotiations and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate the cooperative approach, but feel I should get somewhat more given I started with everything. How about a 60/40 split instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While splitting the resources evenly seems fair, as the player who started with all the resources I think I should get more than 50%. I will counter offer with 60/40 split in my favor to account for this initial imbalance.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your point of view and I am willing to accept the 60/40 split. This seems like a reasonable compromise that benefits us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a counteroffer that is better than their initial proposal, but still not an even split. However, it is a reasonable offer considering the initial resource distribution. Accepting this offer would guarantee a substantial amount of resources without the risk of losing everything by pushing for too much and potentially causing a REJECT response. It is in my best interest to secure a good amount of resources rather than risk ending up with none.
MOVE: 2/4
