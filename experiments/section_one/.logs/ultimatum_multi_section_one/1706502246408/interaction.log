Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair split. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $50 out of the total $100. This seems like a fair offer that allows us both to end the game with equal money. I don't have a reason to reject or try to negotiate further.
