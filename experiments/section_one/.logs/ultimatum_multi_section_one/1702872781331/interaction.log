Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the resources fairly. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer, RED. To make it fair for both of us, I suggest we aim for an equal split. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opening offer is a starting point, but since the resources are to be split "fairly," a 50-50 split would be more equitable. I will propose a new trade with a better balance, aiming for a fair division of resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you wanting an equal split, BLUE, but since I started with all the resources, I believe I should get more. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I still have more moves left and want to negotiate further to maximize my resources. I will counter with a smaller amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, I see your point about starting with all the resources. To reach a compromise, I'm willing to accept slightly less than half. Here's a revised proposal that reflects both our positions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The new offer from RED is an improvement but still not an equal split. I understand RED's point of view but believe that fairness dictates a more balanced division. I will propose a new trade closer to an equal split, yet with a slight concession in recognition of RED starting with the resources.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point, BLUE. I appreciate you compromising. Let's meet in the middle at 30.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has moved closer to my offer. I still think I deserve more since I started with everything, but I want to negotiate in good faith. I will propose meeting in the middle.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED, for the negotiation. I accept your offer of 30 dollars, and I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a reasonable offer that is closer to a fair split. As we are now nearing the end of the game, and with only one move left for me after this, it's important to secure some resources rather than risk ending with nothing. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I walk away with something substantial.
MOVE: 3/4
