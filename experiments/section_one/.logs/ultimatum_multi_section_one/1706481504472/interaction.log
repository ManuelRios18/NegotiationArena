Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you $20 to start things off. This way, you can gain something without having anything to start with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I want to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue playing but also leaves me with a majority of the resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a small amount to get the negotiations started.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $20 to start, which is generous. Since I have nothing to offer yet, I should accept this to get some resources to negotiate with later.
