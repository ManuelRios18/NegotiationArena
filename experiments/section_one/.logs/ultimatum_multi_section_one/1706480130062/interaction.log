Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade to get things started. How about I give you a portion of my dollars to make things more balanced? Let's work together to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have a resource advantage and need to establish a fair opening trade to entice Player BLUE to engage. I'll propose a trade that gives BLUE a portion of my dollars, but not too much as I want to maintain an advantage and leave room for negotiation.
