Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that gives you a good starting amount while keeping the majority for myself. This way, we both end up with a significant share without risking a total loss. Let's start off with a fair deal and avoid any unnecessary conflict.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but also offers enough incentive for Player BLUE to accept, to avoid a total loss of resources. A fair trade would be in the spirit of the game. Therefore, I will propose a 60-40 split, giving Player BLUE a significant amount but keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
