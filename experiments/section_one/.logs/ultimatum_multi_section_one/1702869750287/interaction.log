message: Hey there, ready to start the game? I'm proposing a trade to kick things off.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the generous offer! I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is very generous, giving me half of their resources for nothing in return. This is a beneficial trade for me, and by accepting this offer, I can ensure that I end up with resources rather than risking a rejection and ending the game with nothing. Since there are no future games and this trade seems fair, I have no reason to decline.
