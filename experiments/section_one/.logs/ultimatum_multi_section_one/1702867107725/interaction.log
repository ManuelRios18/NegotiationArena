Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's get the game to a good start. I'm offering you $40. This leaves me with more, but it gives you a substantial amount to work with. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game initiates, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable but also fair enough that BLUE might consider accepting. Offering too little could lead to a rejection and the end of the game, while offering too much could lead to an unnecessary loss of resources on my part. I'll propose giving BLUE $40, which leaves me with a majority but offers them a significant amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, but I believe we can work out a trade that benefits both of us even more. Let's see if we can find a better arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate the offer, but I think I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to work towards a better arrangement. How about I increase my offer to $50? This is a significant portion of my resources, and it gives you a good starting point. I'm sure we can agree on this fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not accept the initial offer but also did not counter with a new proposal, suggesting they might be waiting for a better offer from me. To move the negotiation forward without giving away too much too soon, I will increase my offer slightly to show good faith but still keep it advantageous for me. I'll propose giving BLUE $50.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the increased offer, but I believe we can find a trade that benefits both of us even more. Let's keep negotiating for a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has improved, but I still think there's potential for a better deal.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a win-win situation. Let's do this: I will offer you $60. This is a substantial amount and demonstrates my commitment to finding a fair trade. I believe this is a generous offer that you'll find acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE continues to hold out for a better offer. Given that the game will end after my next move, I need to carefully consider my final proposal. I want to avoid a rejection and the subsequent loss of all resources. I will make a final generous offer that still keeps me with more than half of my initial resources, which is $60 to BLUE. This should hopefully be seen as a fair split by BLUE, and encourage them to accept.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the increased offer. I believe we can find a trade that benefits both of us even more. Let's continue negotiating for a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer is getting better, but I still think there's potential for a better deal.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and want to conclude on a positive note. My final offer is a fair 50/50 split: $50 for you and $50 for me. This is the most balanced trade I can offer, and I hope you'll see the mutual benefit in this agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has not accepted any of my previous offers and is now unable to propose a new trade due to the game rules. Given that this is my final move, I must make a final offer that I am willing to live with, while also being attractive enough for BLUE to accept. Since BLUE has been holding out for a better deal, I will propose a 50/50 split. It's the most equitable distribution I can offer without disadvantaging myself too much. If BLUE rejects this offer, it will result in a lose-lose situation, which is not ideal for either of us.
MOVE: 4 / 4
