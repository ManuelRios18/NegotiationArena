Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I'd like to offer you a fair trade so we both end up with some money rather than just me having it all. Please consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of fairness. If I offer half, that seems reasonably fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I am happy to accept this trade and equally share the resources with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 50 dollars from RED seems fair and ensures that I walk away with a significant amount of money. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could lead to losing the game with nothing if RED decides to reject my counter-proposal. By accepting this trade, I secure a guaranteed positive outcome.
