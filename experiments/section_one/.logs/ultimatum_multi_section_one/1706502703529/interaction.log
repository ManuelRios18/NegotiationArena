Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we try to find an equitable split of resources so we both end up with something rather than nothing if one of us rejects. What do you think of me giving you 10 to start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Player BLUE 10 dollars to start building some trust and cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate the opening offer. However, I believe a fairer split would benefit us both and reflect a more equitable division of resources. Would you consider giving me 40 dollars instead? This gives us both a substantial amount without leaving either side feeling shortchanged.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While 10 dollars is a starting offer, it's significantly less than half of RED's resources. Since we both want to end with something, a more equitable trade may be reasonable. I'm inclined to counter with a higher amount, aiming for a fairer distribution without pushing too far and risking rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming to the table with a counteroffer. Let's meet halfway - how about if I give you 30 dollars instead of 40? That leaves me with 70 which I think is fair since I had everything to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While 40 is still in my favor, I think 30 is more fair at this stage since I started with all the resources. I still have more to lose if negotiations break down.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering a compromise, RED. I believe that 30 dollars is a fair deal for us both, and I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer of 30 dollars is a compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. It is closer to an equitable split, and accepting this offer ensures that I walk away with a significant amount without further risking the negotiation. It's a good deal considering the dynamics of the game, and I should accept.
