message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to make a trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars for nothing in return, as a sign of good faith. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having all the dollars. I want to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE to see if they are willing to cooperate for mutual gain. I propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, but still keeps the majority of dollars with me since I'm taking the first risk in the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept and appreciate you initiating our trading relationship in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 40 dollars for free, which seems generous. I don't have anything to offer in return yet, so I will accept this offer to build some trust and goodwill.
