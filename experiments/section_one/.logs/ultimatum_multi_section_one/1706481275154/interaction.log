message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. How about I give you $40 to help even things out? This way, we both have something to work with, and we can continue to negotiate further. I'm looking forward to a cooperative game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game with a fair starting offer to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage further in the trading process.
