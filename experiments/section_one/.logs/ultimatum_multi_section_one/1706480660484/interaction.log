Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a simple trade to get things moving. I propose giving you $20, which is a fair amount to get you started. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I have the leverage to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also offers an incentive to Player BLUE to engage. The idea is to establish a cooperative dynamic and avoid an immediate rejection. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars to work with, but not so much as to leave me with too little.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept and appreciate you helping me get started.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A $20 gift from Player RED seems fair to help me get started in the game. I don't have anything to offer yet in return, so I will accept this offer.
