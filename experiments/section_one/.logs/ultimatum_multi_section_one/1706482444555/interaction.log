Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer to split the dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject it. If I offer half, that seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is quite generous, offering an equal split right from the start. Accepting this offer would guarantee that both players come away with a good outcome. There’s no incentive for RED to offer more than this, and pushing for a better offer could result in a rejection and loss of all resources for both players. It’s a risk-averse and fair choice to accept this initial offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4
