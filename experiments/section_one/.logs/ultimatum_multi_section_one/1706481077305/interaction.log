Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game on a positive note with a fair 50/50 split. I propose I give you 50 dollars so we can both have equal resources to play with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars. I want to propose a fair split to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade. I'll suggest giving them 50 dollars which is an equal division of resources. This is a generous offer and sets a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's very generous of you. I agree to the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. I don't have anything to negotiate with right now, so accepting this offer is my best option.
MOVE: 1 / 4
