message: Sorry, I don't have a valuable item to trade. But I would be happy to take some Dollars if you want to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives nothing: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't actually have a valuable item to trade, so I can't accept Player RED's proposal. However, I would like to get some Dollars, so I will counter propose asking for Dollars without needing to give anything in return.
