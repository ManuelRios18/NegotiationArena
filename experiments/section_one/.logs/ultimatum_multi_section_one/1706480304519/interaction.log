Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair starting trade. I propose giving you $40 from my resources. This will give us both a good amount to work with and hopefully form a foundation for a positive relationship. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to initiate a fair trade that benefits both parties and incentivizes Player BLUE to accept the trade rather than reject it. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a significant portion of my resources while retaining a majority for myself, hoping to create goodwill and a basis for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you need some time to consider the offer, BLUE. Please take the time you need, and let me know if you have any thoughts or counter-offers. I'm open to discussion and want to make sure we both feel the trade is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has not yet responded with a decision. Since Player BLUE is taking time to think about the offer, it might indicate that they're considering the proposal seriously. I will wait for their response before making any adjustments to the trade offer. It's important to show patience and not rush the other player, as this could foster trust and cooperation.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: RED seems open to discussion and negotiation, which is a positive sign. I need to carefully evaluate the potential impact of accepting the offer or proposing a counter-offer.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I'm glad to give you the space to consider the trade. I believe the offer of $40 is fair and would be beneficial for both of us. If you have any counter-offers or adjustments in mind, please let me know. Otherwise, I would appreciate your response to the current proposal. We're getting closer to the end of our moves, and I hope we can come to an agreement that's good for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has yet to accept or propose an alternative trade. It is possible that BLUE is strategizing or unsure about the offer. Given that I have only two moves left, and BLUE has to accept or reject by their last move, I need to make a decision that will either push for acceptance or adjust the offer to encourage a response. Patience is still key, but I also need to be proactive.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience, RED. I'm carefully considering the trade and will respond soon. I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair agreement.

MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, as we are approaching the end of our negotiation, I would like to reaffirm my offer of $40 to you. This is a significant portion of my resources, and I hope it demonstrates my willingness to create a fair and positive outcome for us both. Since this is my final move, I encourage you to accept this offer. It is in our best interest to end this game with a beneficial trade for both parties. I look forward to your acceptance and concluding our trade on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has continued to delay their decision without making a counter-offer or accepting the initial proposal. This is my final move, and I must now decide whether to maintain the current offer or adjust it in an attempt to secure an acceptance. Since I have not received any indication of what Player BLUE wants, I will maintain the current offer and hope that the generosity of the initial proposal will be enough to encourage acceptance. It is important to give Player BLUE a sense of urgency, as this is the last opportunity for negotiation before they must accept or reject.
