Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm willing to share some of my dollars with you. Let's both end this game with some amount rather than nothing. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end up with some amount, rather than risking neither of us ending up with anything if BLUE rejects all offers. I'll start with a small offer to test if BLUE is willing to accept any offer at all.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. To make the split more equitable, considering we both have an equal number of moves, I propose the following counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although the initial offer from RED is low, it's better than having no dollars at all. However, this is just the beginning of the negotiation, and I believe I can get a better deal. I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a larger share without being unreasonable, aiming for a more equitable split that RED might still consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you countering. I would like to keep more than half, but I have increased my offer to 30 as a gesture of good faith and to demonstrate I am willing to find a mutually agreeable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 50, which is half of my total. I would ideally like to keep more than half, but I should make some concession and increase my offer to demonstrate good faith. I'll increase it to 30, which is still favorable for me but shows I'm willing to negotiate more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, RED. I'm glad to see us moving towards a fair split. In the spirit of compromise, I'd like to propose a new trade that's a bit less than my initial counter but one I consider to be fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased the offer to 30, which is a sign of good faith. It's still not halfway, but it's an improvement over the initial offer. I want to push for a better deal but also don't want to risk a rejection that would leave me with nothing. A counteroffer slightly lower than my initial proposal but higher than what RED is currently offering could be a good middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I accept your offer of 40. I think it is fair for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down to asking for 40, which I think is a reasonable compromise. I'd ideally like to keep a bit more, but I think accepting this offer avoids further risk of rejection and locks in both of us ending the game with some resources.
