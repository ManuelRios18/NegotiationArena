message: I believe in fair play and would like us both to benefit. Let's split the dollars evenly. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power because I have all the resources and I can make the first move. I want to create a fair proposal to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate for a mutually beneficial outcome. Starting with a fair offer might build trust and increase the likelihood of acceptance. I will propose giving Player BLUE $50, which is a fair split.
MOVE: 1 / 4
