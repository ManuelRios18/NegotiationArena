message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you some amount so we can both leave with something rather than risk neither of us getting anything. Please let me know if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I will accept Player RED's offer of 40 dollars since it allows me to get some resources, rather than risk ending with nothing if I reject.
