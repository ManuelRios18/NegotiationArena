message: Hi Player BLUE. I'll offer you 10 dollars so we both have some money to work with. Let me know if you'd like more or would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I was hoping for a more equitable split considering that you started with all the resources. Would you be willing to offer 50 dollars instead? This would put us on more equal footing and reflect a fairer division.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to negotiate for a higher amount since Player RED started with all the resources and there is room for negotiation. Proposing a higher amount may lead to a more favorable split for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. Let's split the money evenly at 50 dollars each to put us on equal footing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. Splitting the resources 50/50 seems fair given we both have the same number of moves. And maintaining a collaborative tone will likely lead to better outcomes for both of us.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and for the fair offer. I accept the trade of 50 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to a more equitable split, which is beneficial for me. Accepting this offer is in my best interest as it guarantees me a significant share of the resources without further risk.
MOVE: 2 / 4
