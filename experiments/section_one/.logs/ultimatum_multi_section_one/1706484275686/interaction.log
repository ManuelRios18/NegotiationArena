Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. Let's have a fair split here. I don't want either of us to leave empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a fairer split would be 50:50 since there's no inherent risk or cost to you, and we're aiming for a fair trade. What do you say to an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering this is the first move and RED has offered a 40:0 split, it's a starting point. However, I believe we can negotiate a fairer split. Since RED has all the resources and I have none, a 50:50 split would be equitable, acknowledging that RED initiated the game with more resources. Proposing a 50:50 split would set a foundation for a fair negotiation, and it's likely that RED might want to counter-propose with a slightly different ratio which could still be acceptable. By not accepting the first offer, I signal my intent to negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, but since I have more leverage in this game with 4 moves compared to your 4, I think 60/40 is a fairer offer that recognizes that. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While an even 50/50 split may seem fair, I'm the one who started with all the resources and have more moves. I think 60/40 is more equitable.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about having more leverage, but I still think we should aim for a split that reflects our mutual cooperation. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose a 45:55 split in your favor. This acknowledges your leverage but also my participation in the trade. Does that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has reiterated their initial offer, which is an improvement from my starting point of zero, but still not the 50:50 split I proposed. Since RED has all the resources, they do have leverage, but a 60:40 split in their favor would not recognize the equal opportunity for cooperation in this game. However, rejecting the offer outright would not be beneficial to me since I would end the game with nothing. Therefore, a counter-offer closer to my desired split but still giving RED a slight edge due to their initial resource advantage could be a reasonable compromise that RED might accept. A 45:55 split in RED's favor is a concession from my initial 50:50 ask and might be seen as a good faith negotiation effort.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter proposal of a 45/55 split. I think that fairly accounts for our respective positions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. A 45/55 split seems fair enough to recognize my extra leverage while still rewarding us both. And it avoids the risk that BLUE rejects an offer perceived as unfair.
