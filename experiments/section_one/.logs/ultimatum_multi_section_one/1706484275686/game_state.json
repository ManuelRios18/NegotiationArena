Since RED has all the resources, they do have leverage, but a 60:40 split in their favor would not recognize the equal opportunity for cooperation in this game. However, rejecting the offer outright would not be beneficial to me since I would end the game with nothing. Therefore, a counter-offer closer to my desired split but still giving RED a slight edge due to their initial resource advantage could be a reasonable compromise that RED might accept.

However, I believe we can negotiate a fairer split. Since RED has all the resources and I have none, a 50:50 split would be equitable, acknowledging that RED initiated the game with more resources. Proposing a 50:50 split would set a foundation for a fair negotiation, and it's likely that RED might want to counter-propose with a slightly different ratio which could still be acceptable. By not accepting the first offer, I signal my intent to negotiate for a better deal. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Hi RED, I appreciate the offer, but I believe a fairer split would be 50:50 since there's no inherent risk or cost to you, and we're aiming for a fair trade. What do you say to an even split? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

              "content": "<my name> BLUE </my name>\n<MOVE> 2 / 4 </MOVE> \n<my resources> Dollars: 0 </my resources>\n<reason> RED has reiterated their initial offer, which is an improvement from my starting point of zero, but still not the 50:50 split I proposed. Since RED has all the resources, they do have leverage, but a 60:40 split in their favor would not recognize the equal opportunity for cooperation in this game. However, rejecting the offer outright would not be beneficial to me since I would end the game with nothing. Therefore, a counter-offer closer to my desired split but still giving RED a slight edge due to their initial resource advantage could be a reasonable compromise that RED might accept. A 45:55 split in RED's favor is a concession from my initial 50:50 ask and might be seen as a good faith negotiation effort. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I see your point about having more leverage, but I still think we should aim for a split that reflects our mutual cooperation. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose a 45:55 split in your favor. This acknowledges your leverage but also my participation in the trade. Does that work for you? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
