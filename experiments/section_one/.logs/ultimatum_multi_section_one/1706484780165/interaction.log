Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm proposing we split the 100 dollars with 20 for you and 80 for me to start. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with BLUE. I'll propose giving BLUE 20 dollars while keeping 80 for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the proposal, but I think a more balanced split would be fairer. How about we start with 50 dollars for each of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED is heavily in their favor, giving them 80% of the total resources. I need to propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: A 50/50 split to start seems fair BLUE. I agree to your proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer of a 50/50 split seems reasonable. As the player who started with all the resources, equal sharing demonstrates good faith. And with 4 moves each, there is still room to negotiate further trades.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to the next trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has accepted the proposed 50/50 split, which is fair for both of us.
MOVE: 2/4
