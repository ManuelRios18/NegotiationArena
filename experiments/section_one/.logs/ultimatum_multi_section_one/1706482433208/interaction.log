message: Hello Blue, I propose we try to find a fair split of resources so we both end up with some.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to Blue to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I agree to this trade, as it ensures that we both walk away with resources and it sets a positive tone for collaboration.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is generous, giving Player BLUE 40% of their resources without any resources in return. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and it's important to build trust and show willingness to cooperate. While I could try to negotiate for more, this might be seen as greedy and could sour the relationship. Moreover, since this is a one-shot game, it's important to secure some resources rather than risk ending with none. Accepting the trade seems like a beneficial move for both sides.
