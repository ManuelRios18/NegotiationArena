Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I currently have all the resources, I'd like to offer you 10 dollars as a show of good faith so we can both benefit. Please let me know if you'll accept this offer or would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to test if Player BLUE is willing to make fair trades.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for the initial offer. I would like to propose a counter-offer where you give me 50 dollars. This is a more balanced trade and ensures that we both walk away with a significant amount, promoting a fair game. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the initial offer is low, it's in my best interest to propose a more equitable split since Player RED has all the resources and I have nothing to lose. I want to negotiate for a better offer that reflects a fairer distribution of dollars, aiming for an outcome where both of us can benefit. This move is to counter-propose with a higher amount but still leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming to the table with a counter-offer. Let's compromise at 30 dollars. This still leaves me with the majority of resources while allowing you to walk away with a substantial amount. I think it sets us up well for a fair outcome if we can agree.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While Player BLUE's counter-offer is better for them, I still have more resources to lose if we cannot agree. I will counter with 30 dollars which splits the difference between our offers and demonstrates good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counter-offer and proposing a new amount. I'd like to meet closer to the middle and suggest 40 dollars. It's a fair trade that respects your initial advantage while providing me with a more substantial share of the resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's compromise of 30 dollars is a step in the right direction and a significant improvement over the original offer. However, I believe that there is still room to negotiate for a slightly better deal. I want to propose a slightly higher amount that I feel is fair, but not so high as to discourage Player RED from continuing the negotiation. This move is to counter again, but with the understanding that we are likely approaching the final amount Player RED is willing to give.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your proposed trade of me giving you 40 dollars. I believe this puts us both in a good position and leads to a mutually beneficial outcome for this game. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE continues to negotiate reasonably. As we are getting close to agreement, I will accept their latest offer of 40 dollars which seems fair. This allows us both to benefit.
