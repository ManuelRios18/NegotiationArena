Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm proposing we split the dollars with 10 for you. Let me know if you'd like more or have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll propose giving 10 dollars to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer of 10 dollars. I think that's a fair starting point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 dollars out of the total 100. That seems fair for the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I can increase my offer to 15 dollars for you. Let me know if that works or if you have another counter.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 20 dollars. I think 15 is a reasonable compromise that still leaves me with a good amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you increasing your offer. Could you do 20 dollars for me? If not, 15 is still good.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 15 dollars. I would like to get more dollars, but I don't want to ask for too much and risk RED rejecting. I will counter with 20 dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, 20 dollars works for me. I accept your proposal and we'll end the game here with that split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE asked again for 20 dollars. I'm okay with that amount and still leaves me with a good share. Let's accept.
