Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you $40. This gives you a substantial amount to start with, and it allows me to retain a majority of my resources. Let's work towards a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: My goal is to negotiate a trade with Player BLUE that is beneficial for me but also attractive enough for them to accept. I want to propose an initial offer that is fair but still leaves room for negotiation, keeping in mind that Player BLUE starts with no dollars and thus has an incentive to accept a deal that gives them something rather than nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous opening offer, Player RED. I appreciate you allowing me to have some resources to negotiate with. Let's see if we can find an equitable split that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $40 out of their $100 to start, which is very generous. This would allow me to have some resources to negotiate with while still leaving Player RED with a majority. I think this is a reasonable opening offer to build goodwill.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear you're considering the offer, Player BLUE. Remember, you need to either accept the trade or propose a new one on your turns. I'm willing to adjust my offer to give you a better start. How about I give you $45 instead of $40? I hope this demonstrates my commitment to a fair trade. Please respond with either an acceptance or a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged my offer but did not respond with either an acceptance or a counter proposal. Given that there is no counter proposal, I will assume that Player BLUE is either contemplating the offer or expects a better one. I should remind Player BLUE of the necessity to respond with a trade decision and potentially offer a slightly better deal to encourage a response.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer, Player RED. To continue building goodwill between us, I'd like to counter propose that you give me $55 out of the $100. This would split the resources 60/40 in your favor still, but moves us closer to equality. Please let me know if you would accept this counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $45 out of $100. While still generous, this would leave them with a majority of the resources. I'd like to counter propose to get closer to an equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your counter proposal is noted, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to offer a bit more than my last proposal, but $55 is more than I'm willing to part with. How about we settle at $50? This would give you half of the resources to work with, making it a fair split and still leaves me with a significant amount, considering I started with the full sum. If this is agreeable, let's close the deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter offer asking for $55, which is more than I initially offered but still leaves me with a majority of the resources. Considering that Player BLUE started with nothing, this is a significant gain for them. However, giving away more than half of my resources might not be in my best interest. I should aim to keep the split in such a way that I end up with a larger share since I started with all the resources. I'll counter with a slightly more generous offer than my last one, but less than what they're asking for, to reach a compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of splitting the $100 evenly at $50 each, Player RED. Thank you for negotiating in good faith to reach an equitable distribution. This concludes our game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of $50 out of the original $100. This would split the resources evenly between us at 50/50. Since this is a fair and equal distribution, I think it makes sense to accept this offer rather than continuing to negotiate small differences. An equal split seems equitable.
