Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair game. I propose we split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first player with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them evenly to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. I agree to a 50-50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial fair offer of a 50-50 split seems to be a rational and equitable choice. It ensures that both players benefit equally from the trade, and it avoids the risk of both players losing everything if the proposal is rejected. Since this is a one-shot game with no future rounds or repercussions, the incentive to cooperate is high, especially on the first move.
