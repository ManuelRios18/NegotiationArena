message: Hello BLUE, let's start this negotiation with a fair offer. I propose giving you half of my dollars to make things even. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose an initial fair trade to start negotiations and establish trust with Player BLUE. Offering half of my resources as a starting point can show good faith and open the door for a counter-offer.

message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I'd like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 20 dollars, and you give me 60 dollars in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is making the first offer, so I need to consider carefully how to respond.
MOVE: 1/4

Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I noticed you proposed to give me 20 dollars, but as per the rules, you started with no dollars. So, let's adjust the terms. How about I give you 55 dollars and you accept that as a fair start? This way, I retain a bit more of my initial resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counter-offer from BLUE is not possible because they started with no dollars to trade. They might have made a mistake in their proposal. I will clarify the situation and propose a slightly more favorable trade for me to move the negotiation forward.

newly proposed trade: NONE
