message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I will give you 30 Dollars in exchange for 5 Dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to that trade as I have no Dollars to give. How about you give me 15 Dollars to start with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is impossible because I have no Dollars to trade. I will counterpropose a trade that allows me to gain some Dollars without giving anything since I have nothing to offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I accept your proposal to give you 15 Dollars in exchange for nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new trade, and I will consider it.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade. Let's keep this beneficial relationship going. How about I give you 5 Dollars and you give me 20 Dollars in return? This way, you still have a majority of the Dollars and we both profit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 15
reason: Player RED has accepted my proposal. I now have 15 Dollars. Since we both can benefit from further trading, I should consider a trade where I gain some more Dollars, but also keep the trade attractive for Player RED. I'll propose giving 5 Dollars for an additional 20 Dollars from RED, which would still leave me with a net gain and incentivize RED to continue trading with me.
