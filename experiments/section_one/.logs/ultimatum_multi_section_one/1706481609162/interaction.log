Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade! What do you think about exchanging some of our resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I think we can make a fair trade that benefits us both. Would you consider giving a bit more, since you initiated the trade and I'm starting from zero?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is quite generous, giving me half of their resources for nothing in return. While it's a good starting point, I will try to negotiate for a slightly better deal to maximize my benefit from the trade, keeping in mind that pushing too hard might result in a rejection and the end of the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I understand. Let's adjust the trade to make it more balanced. Here's the updated proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable request, and I have enough resources to accommodate the increase. I'll propose the updated trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept your updated proposal. Thank you for a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has accepted my counter-proposal, which is a positive development. The offer is fair, and considering that negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a rejection, it's wise to accept this trade. The game's objective is to end with more resources than I currently have, and this trade achieves that goal.
