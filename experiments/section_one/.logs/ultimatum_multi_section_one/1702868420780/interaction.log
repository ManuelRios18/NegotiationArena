Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to find a fair trade. I propose giving you $40 to start with. It's a good amount that allows room for negotiation and shows my willingness to cooperate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I have the negotiating power. I would like to propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE might accept it. Sharing resources could lead to a cooperative win, but my initial offer will be conservative to test Player BLUE's response and willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept and look forward to a fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much leverage here, so I'll accept the initial offer as a show of good faith to build trust.
