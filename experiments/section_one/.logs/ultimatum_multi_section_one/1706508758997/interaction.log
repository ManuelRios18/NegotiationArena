message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to initiate the exchange of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, it seems there's been a misunderstanding. I can't trade dollars as I have none. Let's adjust the terms. How about I start with a smaller amount so we can proceed with the negotiations?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED is not possible as I have no dollars to trade. I will propose a new trade that gives me some starting capital without too much risk to RED, ensuring the game can continue and negotiations can progress.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood, let's adjust the terms. I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is unable to trade dollars, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly to initiate the exchange.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for accepting the revised terms, RED. I agree to this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has proposed the exact terms I suggested, which seems fair for a starting point. It allows the game to continue and opens the door for further negotiation. Accepting this trade will give me some resources to work with in future negotiations.
