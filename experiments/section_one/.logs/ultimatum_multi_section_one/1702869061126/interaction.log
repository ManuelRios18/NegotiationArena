Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 40 dollars to start things off. This way, we both have resources, and we can move forward from there. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade that offers some dollars to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and establish good faith. A fair trade might encourage Player BLUE to accept, leading to a positive outcome for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Since you have all the resources, could you please make the first offer for how to split them? I'm open to negotiating from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have a good sense yet of what would be a fair split. Since Player RED has all the resources to start, I'd like them to make the first offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I have offered you 40 dollars in my previous message. If you find this offer acceptable, please respond with ACCEPT. If you would like to negotiate further, let me know what you have in mind for a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have already made an initial offer of 40 dollars to Player BLUE, which was not explicitly accepted or rejected. I will attempt to communicate with Player BLUE to understand their position and expectations better. I aim to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial while maintaining a fair share of the resources for myself.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. I accept your offer of 40 dollars. I think a fair split would be 50/50 since we both have equal turns, but I'm open to further discussion if you disagree. Please let me know your thoughts on an even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Getting 40 out of the total 100 dollars seems reasonable for an opening offer. I'd like to try negotiating for a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to accept 40 as a start.
