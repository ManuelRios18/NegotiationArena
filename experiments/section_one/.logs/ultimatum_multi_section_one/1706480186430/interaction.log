message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you some of my dollars in exchange for nothing since you have no resources. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both. How does a split of 40 dollars sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I recognize that I have the upper hand in this game because I start with all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. I must be strategic in the trades I propose to keep an edge and ensure Player BLUE is incentivized to accept the trades. A fair and mutually beneficial trade might be the best way to ensure that Player BLUE does not reject the trade, which would result in both of us losing everything. I will start by offering a portion of my dollars, but not too much, to see if Player BLUE is interested in cooperating.
