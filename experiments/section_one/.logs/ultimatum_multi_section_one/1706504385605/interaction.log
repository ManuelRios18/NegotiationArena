Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's try to find a fair split of resources so we both walk away happy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you making an opening offer and starting the negotiation. Let's see if we can find an equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars out of the total 100 dollars. This seems like a fair opening offer to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That's a fair split BLUE. Let's end it here and both walk away happy with our share.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 50, which is half. That seems fair. I don't want to risk rejecting and losing everything over trying to keep a little more.
MOVE: 2 / 4
