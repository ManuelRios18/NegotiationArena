message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off? I believe this is a generous offer, and it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm aiming to propose a fair split with Player BLUE to encourage acceptance and avoid rejection. This initial offer will also serve as an opener to gauge Player BLUE's response and willingness to trade. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars, but also leaves me with a majority since I'm the one with the starting resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the offer of 40 dollars. I'd like to propose a different trade. How about you give me 50 dollars and I'll give you 10 dollars in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is to give me 40 dollars. This seems like a good start, but I want to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see there might have been a misunderstanding. Since you don't have any dollars to trade, we'll need to adjust the offer. How about I give you 30 dollars? This way we can move forward with the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal doesn't make sense since they have no dollars to trade. It appears to be a misunderstanding of the game's rules. I will reject this proposal and make a new offer that aligns with the rules, giving Player BLUE less than my initial offer to account for the misunderstanding and to encourage a more reasonable counter in their next move.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I understand the adjustment. I'd like to counter-offer with a trade where you give me 40 dollars and I'll give you 10 dollars in return. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has adjusted the offer to 30 dollars. It's still a reasonable amount, but I want to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: It seems there's still a bit of confusion. In this game, you cannot offer dollars since you started with none. Let's try this: I'll give you 35 dollars, and you don't need to give anything in return. This should be a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE still seems to misunderstand the rules, as they cannot offer dollars in return. I need to clarify the game's rules in my message and propose a new trade. Since this is my third move, I should propose a slightly better offer than my last one to show willingness to negotiate and to get closer to a deal by my final move. I'll offer 35 dollars, which is a compromise between my previous offers.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your offer of 35 dollars. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has clarified the rules and offered 35 dollars without expecting anything in return. It's a tempting offer, and I believe it's in my best interest to accept this trade.
