Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey, Player BLUE! I'd like to propose a trade. I'll give you 30 dollars in exchange for 10 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey Player RED! I can't accept the trade as proposed because I don't have any dollars to give. How about you give me 15 dollars to even out the playing field?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED doesn't make sense for me since I have no dollars to trade. I must counter-propose a trade that benefits me but also seems fair enough for Player RED to consider. I'll propose a simple trade that gives me dollars without requiring an initial investment.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, Player BLUE. I accept your counter-offer of 15 dollars for 0 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered my proposal, and I believe it's a fair adjustment.
