However, since we're both still early in the negotiation process, there might be room to negotiate a slightly higher amount. I want to propose a number that is more than the current offer but less than my previous counter to show willingness to compromise. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for the offer, RED. It's a step in the right direction. I'm willing to compromise as well. Let's meet closer to the middle. What do you think about 40 dollars? It's less than what I initially asked for and more fair to both of us. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
