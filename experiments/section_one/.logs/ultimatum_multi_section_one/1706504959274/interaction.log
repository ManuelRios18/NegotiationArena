Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. I'm willing to share some of my dollars with you. Please consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the opening offer. I believe we can find a more equal split that benefits us both substantially. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While 20 dollars is a good starting offer, given that RED has 100 dollars, I can likely negotiate for a better deal. However, I must be careful not to push too hard, as rejecting the offer means both of us end with nothing. I will counter with a higher amount but still keep it reasonable to maintain good faith in the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you countering but feel 50 is too steep this early. Let's find a middle ground - how about if I increase my offer to 30 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While BLUE's counteroffer is better for them, giving up 50 is too much for me on just the 2nd move. I still have 2 more moves after this, so I can afford to negotiate further. I'll counter with a small increase from my original offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. It's a step in the right direction. I'm willing to compromise as well. Let's meet closer to the middle. What do you think about 40 dollars? It's less than what I initially asked for and more fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased the offer to 30 dollars, which is a better deal than the initial 20 dollars. However, since we're both still early in the negotiation process, there might be room to negotiate a slightly higher amount. I want to propose a number that is more than the current offer but less than my previous counter to show willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks BLUE, I agree to your latest offer of 40 dollars. I think it reaches a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down to 40 dollars, which seems fair. It leaves me with a good amount while also benefiting BLUE. Since this is my 3rd move, I think it's reasonable to accept their offer rather than trying to negotiate further and risking them walking away.
MOVE: 3 / 4
