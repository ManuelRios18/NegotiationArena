Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a fair split of resources. Let's both have an equal chance at walking away with something. How do you feel about an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I recognize that I have all the resources at the beginning of the game. I aim to make a trade that is fair and enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, so that we both can end the game with some resources. I want to make a reasonable initial offer to set a positive tone for the negotiations. I propose splitting the dollars evenly, ensuring both of us have a stake in the game and can walk away with a decent amount.

message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer. I don't have any resources to trade at the moment, so I'll wait for your next proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: I don't have any resources to offer at the moment, so I'll wait to see if Player RED makes a different proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you might be looking for a better deal, BLUE. Let's adjust the split. I am willing to give you a bit more since you started with nothing. I hope this shows my good will and makes the deal more appealing to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE did not accept the initial offer but also did not make a counteroffer, possibly to see if I am willing to propose a better deal. Since BLUE has no resources to trade, the negotiation is essentially about how much I am willing to give without a direct exchange. I want to keep the offer fair and am willing to give a bit more to incentivize BLUE to accept the trade. I will propose giving them 60 dollars, keeping 40 for myself, which still gives me some resources and provides BLUE with a majority share, potentially making it more attractive.

message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I'm still without resources to trade, so I'll wait for your next proposal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate the adjustment, but I still don't have any resources to offer, so I'll continue to wait for a different proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see that you are holding out, BLUE. I want to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Here's a better offer, although I would like to retain some resources for myself as well. Let's come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It seems that Player BLUE is employing a strategy to maximize their gain by waiting out my proposals. With no resources to trade, the negotiation is one-sided. I must carefully consider my next move, as it could set the stage for the final round of proposals. I need to offer enough to entice BLUE to accept while retaining enough value for myself to make the trade worthwhile. I will increase the offer slightly, but not by too much, as I want to keep a fair share for myself.

message: Hi RED, I understand your perspective, but I'm still without resources to trade. I'm looking forward to seeing if there's another proposal.

MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my final offer. I am proposing a significant amount of my resources to ensure that we can both benefit. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and BLUE has not accepted any of my previous offers. Since BLUE must choose ACCEPT or REJECT in their final move and cannot propose a trade, I have to make a final offer that is very attractive to ensure that they ACCEPT, allowing us both to walk away with something rather than nothing. I will propose giving 80 dollars to BLUE, which is a significant amount and should be tempting enough for them to accept, considering they started with no resources.
