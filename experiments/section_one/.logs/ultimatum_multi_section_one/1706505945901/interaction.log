Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you 40 dollars to get things started. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an opening offer that is somewhat generous to start the negotiations on a positive note, but I also want to maintain a majority of the resources since I am the one with the dollars to trade. Offering 40 dollars could be a good starting point, as it gives Player BLUE a significant amount to work with while leaving me with a majority.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the generous offer, RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 40 dollars to start, which seems fair. I'd like to accept this offer so we both have some resources to negotiate with.
