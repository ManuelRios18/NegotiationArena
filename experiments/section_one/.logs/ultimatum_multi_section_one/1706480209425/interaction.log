Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 50 dollars in exchange for nothing. This should give us both a substantial amount of resources and set a cooperative tone for our game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade that I believe is fair and will provide an incentive for Player BLUE to engage in the trade. By offering 50 dollars, I am giving up half of my resources in the hopes that this cooperative gesture will be met positively, potentially leading to an agreement that benefits us both.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED seems to be in my favor, as they are offering me 50 dollars for nothing. This would give me a substantial amount of resources without giving up anything.
