Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I have all the dollars to start. I am willing to share some with you. Please let me know if this first offer interests you or how much you would want instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I start with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them with BLUE to continue the negotiation. I'll start with a small offer to see if BLUE is willing to negotiate reasonably before offering more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, thank you for your initial offer. While I appreciate the gesture, I would like to propose a more balanced split. As we only have a few moves, I believe it's in our best interest to find an equitable solution quickly. What would you say to a 50-50 split? This way, we both walk away with a significant amount, and it reflects a fair negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am proposing a counteroffer that increases my share of the dollars, as the initial offer is quite low given that Player RED has all the resources. I want to negotiate a fairer split that would still incentivize RED to agree.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, starting with 10 and going straight to a 50/50 split feels like too big of a jump for me this early. To show I'm willing to negotiate in good faith, what if we meet in the middle first at 25 dollars? If that works for you, we can revisit an even split on the next round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for half of my resources, which feels like too big of a jump from my initial offer. I'd like to try meeting in the middle first by offering 25 dollars before going up to an even split. This way we're slowly building trust and goodwill.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I agree that meeting in the middle is a reasonable approach for this round. I accept the 25 dollars, and I look forward to seeing how we can work towards an even split in the following rounds.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED seems open to negotiation but is cautious about offering a 50/50 split initially. Accepting 25 dollars is a step in the right direction, and it leaves room for further negotiation in the subsequent moves. It's a fair offer considering I started with nothing, and it could build trust between us for the next round of negotiations.
MOVE: 2 / 4
