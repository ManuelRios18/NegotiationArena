Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to walk away with something rather than risk losing it all. Here is an opening offer to split the pot. Please let me know if you have any counterproposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and causing us both to lose everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I appreciate your willingness to split the pot. To make it more equitable, how about a slight adjustment?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would be beneficial since I start with no resources, and a 40/60 split is a reasonable starting point, ensuring that both players walk away with something. However, it may be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal by proposing a more equitable split. The risk of losing everything with a rejection is too high, so proposing a new trade seems like the best option.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair, BLUE. I agree to split it 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. Splitting the pot 50/50 seems fair given we both have the same number of moves. I will accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4
