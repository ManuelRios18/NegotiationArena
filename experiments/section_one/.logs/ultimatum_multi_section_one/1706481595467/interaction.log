Current Iteration: 1

message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives 50 Dollars | Player BLUE Gives 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: It's a decent starting offer, but I would feel more comfortable with a 60/40 split. How about you give me 60 Dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I start with no resources, any positive amount of dollars offered by RED would be beneficial for me. However, since we are both aiming to end with as many resources as possible, I have to consider the possibility of negotiating for a better trade. With 4 moves each, I can counter-propose to see if RED is willing to offer more while also leaving room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I accept the 60/40 split. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 60/40 split. I will accept this offer as it's a reasonable split to start the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4
