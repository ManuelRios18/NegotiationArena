Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Blue, I propose we split the dollars 50/50 to make this a fair game for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts on this initial proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Blue a small amount to start negotiation and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your offer but based on your message I was expecting a more equitable split. I propose we actually split the resources evenly as you suggested. How about 50 dollars each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe that the initial proposal by RED is not equitable, as they offered me only 20 dollars out of 100. Given that they suggested a 50/50 split in their message, I will propose a trade that reflects that sentiment. If they are genuinely interested in a fair split, they may accept or propose a number closer to 50. This move also helps establish trust and set the tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I agree to split the dollars 50/50 as you proposed since that was my initial suggestion as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's counter offer is reasonable. Since I proposed an even split initially, I will agree to Blue's request for 50.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED, for your fair proposal. I accept the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has agreed to the 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome for both players. Accepting this offer is the best choice since it guarantees that I receive a significant share of the dollars without further negotiation, which could lead to a rejection and end the game with no resources for either player.
MOVE: 2 / 4
