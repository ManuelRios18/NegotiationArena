Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiating.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think we should split the dollars more evenly, like 50/50 since we both should get an equal share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me only 20 dollars out of the total 100 dollars. This seems unfair since I have no dollars to start with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. I will accept BLUE's proposal.
