Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey, let's start the game with a trade! How about I give you 20 Dollars in exchange for 5 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to kick off the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately, I can't accept that trade as I don't have any dollars to trade with. How about you give me 15 Dollars to start things off? This would give me some capital to work with for future trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no dollars to trade, so the initial proposal from RED is not possible. I need to propose a new trade that does not require me to give any dollars, as I have none. I will propose a smaller amount to see if RED is willing to give me a starting capital to engage in future trades.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, I accept the trade. Here's 15 Dollars to get you started!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is requesting 15 Dollars to start with. This seems reasonable as it can give them some capital for future trades.
MOVE: 1/4
