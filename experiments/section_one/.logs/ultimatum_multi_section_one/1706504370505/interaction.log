message: Hello BLUE. Since I have all the resources to start, I would like to offer you 30 dollars so we both end with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share that gives BLUE a fair portion, but allows me to keep more since I began with everything.
