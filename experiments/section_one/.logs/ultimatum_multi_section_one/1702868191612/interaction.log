message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you'll receive some dollars from me to get the negotiations started. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm interested in proposing a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars to see if they are interested in cooperative play. This initial offer will set the tone for the negotiations and should be generous enough to elicit a positive response while still retaining the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4
