Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. Are you ready to negotiate?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer! However, I would like to propose a counteroffer where I receive a bit more, considering that I'm starting from zero. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's proposal of splitting the dollars 50-50 is quite generous considering they started with all the resources. However, in negotiation, there is often room to argue for a better deal. Proposing a slightly more favorable trade for myself could be beneficial, but it's also risky because pushing too hard might lead to a rejection and loss of all resources for both parties. Since this is the first move, there is some space to negotiate. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This still gives Player RED a significant amount of dollars while offering me a reasonable starting point, and it opens up the conversation for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I accept the trade proposed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a counteroffer, which is reasonable. I will accept the counteroffer to build trust and keep the negotiation going.
