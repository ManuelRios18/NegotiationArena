Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my offer to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Player BLUE may reject it. If I offer half, that seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would be the most beneficial action for me since it would provide an immediate and fair split of the resources. There is no advantage in rejecting or proposing a new trade that could potentially lead to a better offer, as the initial offer is already equal. Additionally, rejecting the offer would leave me with no resources, which is not a favorable outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4
