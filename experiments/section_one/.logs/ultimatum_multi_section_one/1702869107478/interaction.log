Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where I'll give you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing. It's a generous offer considering I could keep all the money, and it ensures that we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, I can propose a trade that is favorable to me but also provides an incentive to Player BLUE to accept, so we both end up with some resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of the dollars to ensure cooperation and to avoid a total loss for both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 40 dollars for free, which is very generous. Since I have no bargaining power, I should accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing if I try to negotiate.
