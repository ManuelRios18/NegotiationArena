Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose an even split to start us off on good terms. What do you say we each walk away with $50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to set the initial tone of the game. I want to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to cooperate. A 50-50 split seems fair since it provides equal value to both players, and it could be an appealing starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I accept the even split. Let's start off on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first move, and it's important to establish trust and goodwill in the beginning. Accepting an even split will set a positive tone for the game.
MOVE: 1/4
