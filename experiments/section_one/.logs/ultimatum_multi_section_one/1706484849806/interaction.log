Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. Let's try to find a fair split of the dollars so we both end up better off. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject it and we will both lose. If I offer half, that seems fair and BLUE may accept it.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I'm considering your offer and will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to carefully consider this offer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, let me know what you think about splitting the dollars 50/50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not reject or counter my initial offer, so I will wait to see what they propose next before deciding my next move.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I'm considering your new proposal and will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to carefully consider this new offer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or propose a new trade.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I still think a fair split is 50/50 since I started with everything. Let's keep it simple and split it down the middle.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is now asking for 50 dollars from me when they started with nothing. I proposed an even split initially which seems fairest. I could counter offer with a 60/40 split in my favor since I began with all the resources. But I think sticking to my initial 50/50 offer is reasonable, so I will propose that again rather than letting the negotiations drag on.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I'm still considering the options and will respond shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to consider RED's proposal and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or propose a new trade.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my last offer. Let's simply split the dollars 50/50 so we both end up better off. If you reject, we get nothing. Please accept this fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move to propose a trade before BLUE has to decide whether to accept or reject. I will stand by my initial even split offer since that seems the fairest outcome.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8

newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: This is the final offer from RED, and I need to make a decision.
