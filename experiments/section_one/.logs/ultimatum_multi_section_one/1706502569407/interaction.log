message: Hello Player BLUE. I propose we split the resources fairly so we can both benefit. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Player BLUE a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems like a fair opening offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's offer. 10 dollars seems fair to start.
