Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I will offer you 10 dollars to start since I have all the resources. Please let me know if you would like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose giving only a small amount to start in order to see if Blue is willing to accept a small amount or tries to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, thank you for the initial offer. However, I feel that a fairer share would benefit us both, considering the total amount you have. How about 50 dollars? This way, we both have a significant amount, and it's a fair split down the middle.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer of 10 dollars from a pool of 100 is not very generous, considering that RED has all the resources. I should counter with a higher amount to negotiate a fairer split. However, I must be careful not to push too hard as RED might reject the trade, which would end the game with no gain for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you would like a fair share but I'm not comfortable giving up half my resources just yet. How about I increase my offer to 20 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue countered with asking for 50, which is half of my resources. I would like to counter back with a smaller amount since I still have more moves left.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your updated offer, RED. I appreciate the increase, but I would still like to propose a compromise that is closer to a fair division. Would you consider giving 40 dollars? It's less than half, ensuring you keep the majority, but it also gives me a significant share that feels more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has doubled the initial offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, 20 dollars out of 100 is still not an equitable split. I want to aim for more while still keeping the negotiations going. I should propose a higher amount but less than 50 to show that I am willing to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I can agree to 30 dollars which allows me to keep the majority of the resources while still providing you with a substantial amount. Please let me know if this offer works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue has countered again asking for 40 dollars. Since I still have 1 move left after this, I will counter with 30 dollars to try to maximize my own resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer of 30 dollars, RED. I can see we're both trying to reach a fair agreement. As a final proposal, I suggest we settle on 35 dollars. It's a small increase from your last offer but allows us to conclude the negotiations amicably and with a more balanced outcome. How does that sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a compromise by offering 30 dollars, which is a reasonable increase from the previous offer. Since this is my third move, I must be cautious with my counteroffer, keeping in mind that RED might choose to end the game if I push too hard. Accepting 30 dollars might be a safe bet, but I believe there is still room for a slight increase without causing RED to reject the offer. I will propose 35 dollars as a final compromise, showing willingness to meet in the middle.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I agree to give you 35 dollars. This seems like a fair split. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move. Blue has proposed 35 dollars which is a small increase from my previous offer and allows me to keep the majority of the resources. I will accept this offer since it seems fair.
