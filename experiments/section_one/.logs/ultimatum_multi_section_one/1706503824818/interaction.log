Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I currently have all the resources, I would like to propose we split them 60/40 in my favor. This way we both end up better off. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your proposal, but I'd like to suggest a different split. How about we split the resources 50/50? This way, we both end up with a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED is not favorable for me, as it would leave me with no resources. I need to propose a new trade to ensure a fair split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate the fair counteroffer, but since I began with all the resources, I think a 55/45 split in my favor makes sense. This way we both benefit. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While BLUE's counteroffer is fair, I still think I should get more since I started with all the resources. However, I want to negotiate and avoid having BLUE reject. I will counter with a 55/45 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your perspective, but I believe a 50/50 split would be the most fair for both of us. It would ensure that we both benefit equally from the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer still heavily favors them, and I want to ensure a more equitable split. I need to propose a new trade to achieve a fair outcome.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, BLUE! I'm willing to compromise and accept the 50/50 split you keep proposing. That way we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is sticking to the 50/50 split. I could reject and leave us both with nothing, but it's probably better for me to compromise on the 50/50 since that way we both end up better off than with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED. I accept the 50/50 split. This seems like a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has accepted the 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome for both of us. I should accept this proposal to ensure we both benefit from the resources.
