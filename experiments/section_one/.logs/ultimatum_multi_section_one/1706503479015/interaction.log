Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's try to find a fair split of the dollars so we both benefit. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. Let's see if we can come to a fair agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade at the moment, so I'll go with NONE for now.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to offer more to try to reach an agreement that works for both of us. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not counter my original offer, so I will increase it slightly to try to move the negotiations forward.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the willingness to find a fair deal. Let's keep working on it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I still don't have any resources to trade, so I'll stick with NONE for now.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I want us both to gain something here. Please let me know if this offer works for you or make a counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE still hasn't made a counteroffer, but seems open to finding an agreement. I will increase my offer again, but cannot go too high since this is my next-to-last move.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your goal, but I still don't have any resources to trade. Let's keep working on finding a fair deal.

MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I want us both to gain from this negotiation. Please consider my final offer to split the dollars evenly, 50 for each of us. I hope you will accept this fair proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last chance to make an offer. I will propose splitting the dollars 50-50. That seems like the fairest outcome if BLUE has not been able to make any counteroffers.
MOVE: 4 / 4
