Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I have all the resources right now. Let's try to find a fair split that makes both of us better off. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer too much, I may end up worse off. I'll start with an offer to split the resources evenly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I'll take some time to think about it and come back to you with a proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to carefully consider my options and make sure to propose a fair trade that benefits both of us.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, take your time to think it over and let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE did not accept or reject my initial offer, but instead asked for more time. This could indicate they want to negotiate further. I still have all the resources. I will wait and see what counteroffer BLUE comes back with before deciding my next move.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks, RED. I'm still considering the offer and will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate the patience. I need to ensure that the trade is mutually beneficial before making a decision.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know when you've had more time to consider the offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has still not made a counteroffer and continues to consider my original 50/50 split offer. This likely indicates they are hoping for a more favorable deal for themselves. Since I still have all the leverage with all the resources, I will wait and see BLUE's counter before adjusting my offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your understanding, RED. I'm still evaluating the proposal and will let you know soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to ensure that the trade is fair and beneficial for both of us.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my final offer. Please let me know if you'd like to accept the 50/50 split. Otherwise, we will both end up with nothing. I think it's a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move. BLUE has not provided any counteroffer and continues to delay. At this point, I should stand firm on my initial 50/50 split offer, which I still believe is fair. Making a better offer now would signal weakness and chance BLUE rejecting to try for an even better deal. I will restate my original proposal and wait for BLUE to accept or reject.

MOVE: 4 / 4

player answer: NONE
