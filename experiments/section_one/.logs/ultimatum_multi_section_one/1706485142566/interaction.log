message: Hi Player BLUE. I'm willing to share some of my dollars with you so we can both benefit. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate reasonably.
