Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for both of us to walk away with something rather than nothing, so I'm proposing to split the dollars. Please let me know if you have any counterproposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the 50-50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50-50 split seems fair, as it ensures that both players walk away with a positive outcome. Rejecting or countering with an aggressive proposal could lead to the RED player rejecting and both of us ending with nothing. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee a positive result for both parties without unnecessary risk.
