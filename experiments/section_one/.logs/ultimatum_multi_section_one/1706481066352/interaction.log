message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this off with a simple trade. How about I give you $10 for nothing in return? This way, you can have some dollars to work with, and we can continue negotiating from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with resources, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but still attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will start by offering a small amount to gauge their reaction and willingness to trade.
