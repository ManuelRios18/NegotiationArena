Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. But I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I'll need some time to review and come up with a proposal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to carefully consider my response and come up with a counteroffer that benefits both of us.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you considering my offer. Let's compromise at 17.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 17 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with a lower amount. I would prefer to get at least 20, but I could meet in the middle as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still considering the best offer and will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 16 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I can see that RED is willing to compromise, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal for both of us.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal on your last offer - 16 works for me. I think that leaves us both better off than where we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 16 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered again with a slightly lower amount. At this point I'm willing to accept 16 to finalize a deal before time runs out.
MOVE: 3 / 4
