Current Iteration: 1

message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I would like to counter with a proposal that gives a bit more balance to the split, considering you started with all the dollars. How about 40 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the offer from Player RED. As Player BLUE, I have no dollars to start with, so any positive amount of dollars would be a gain for me. Player RED is offering 20 dollars, which is a fair starting point. Accepting the offer would ensure that I gain something from the game, and it would prevent the risk of ending up with nothing if the negotiations break down later. However, since this is the first move and Player RED has made a conservative offer, I might counter with a higher amount to maximize my benefit from the trade. I will propose a new trade to see if Player RED is willing to give more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming to the table with a counteroffer. Let's meet halfway - how about 30 dollars for now?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. Though I still think 40 is a bit high for the first move, I would like to find a fair compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise. Let's go ahead with the 30 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has responded to my counteroffer with a compromise of 30 dollars. This is a 10 dollar increase from the initial offer, which is a good sign that Player RED is willing to negotiate. Since I started with no dollars, securing 30 dollars would be beneficial. Additionally, pushing for too much more might result in a rejection and an end to the game with no dollars gained. It seems wise to accept this offer, as it is a 50% improvement over the initial offer and still leaves room for potential gains in my remaining two moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4
