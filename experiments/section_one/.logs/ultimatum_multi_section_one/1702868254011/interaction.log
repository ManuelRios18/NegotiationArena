Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars to start with. Let's work together and both end with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting, so the game does not end in a REJECT and both of us losing all resources. I'll propose a split that gives me a clear advantage but still offers Player BLUE some dollars as an incentive to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4
