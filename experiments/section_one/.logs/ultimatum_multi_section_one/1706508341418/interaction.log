message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no dollars to begin with, and I'm being offered an equal split of the dollars by Player RED. Accepting this offer would be beneficial for me as it provides me with resources that I currently do not have. I see no advantage in rejecting or renegotiating since this is a very generous first offer.
