------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the opening offer. How about we make it 30 dollars? That would still leave you with a significant majority of the resources, but it would feel a bit more balanced to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 20 dollars is a fair starting point, but I believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal as RED has all the resources and I have the power to reject any proposal, which would result in RED losing all their resources. I'll propose a higher amount to see if RED is willing to share more, aiming for a more equitable distribution.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I would prefer 25 dollars to keep a little more for myself. But I think that is still a good amount for you. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While 30 would be more balanced, I'd like to counter with 25 to try to maximize my own outcome. But I still want BLUE to feel they are getting a fair share.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I think 25 dollars is a fair compromise. I accept your offer. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer of 25 dollars is a fair compromise between the initial offer and my counter. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with a substantial amount of the resources without further risking the deal by pushing too hard, which could lead to a rejection and both of us ending with nothing. It makes sense to accept this deal and secure a positive outcome for myself.
