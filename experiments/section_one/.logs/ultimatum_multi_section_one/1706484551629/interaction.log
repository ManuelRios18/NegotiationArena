Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation. Here is an opening offer to get our discussion started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer, but I have to reject it as it doesn't benefit me. Let's see if we can come up with a more balanced proposal.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opening offer from RED is to give 20 dollars in exchange for nothing. This offer doesn't benefit me at all, so I will reject it.
MOVE: 1 / 4
