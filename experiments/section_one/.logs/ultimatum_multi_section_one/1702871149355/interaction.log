Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars 60/40 in the first round. Please let me know if this seems fair or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your initial offer, but I would like to counter with an even 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest approach for both of us since it's the very beginning of the negotiation and neither of us has done anything to justify a larger share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to propose a more even split since it's the beginning of the game and negotiating for a fair share is reasonable. I want to encourage a cooperative atmosphere to avoid the reject option.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That's a fair counter offer. I agree to split it 50/50 for the first round.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair for the first round. I'll accept.
