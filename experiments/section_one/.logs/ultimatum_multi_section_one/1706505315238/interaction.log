message: Hi Player BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, let me think about it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first trade proposal from Player RED. I need to consider my options carefully.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time to consider the offer. Let me know if you have any other proposals in mind or would like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE did not propose a counteroffer and seems to be considering my opening offer still. I will wait and see if they come back with a counterproposal before modifying my offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. I'm still considering the offer and will let you know if I have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is sticking to the same trade proposal. I need to decide if I want to accept, reject, or propose a counteroffer.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm going to sweeten my offer since we're getting close to the end of the game. Please let me know if this new proposal interests you more or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still considering my original offer and has not provided a counteroffer. Since this is my third move, I should modify my offer to be more appealing before my last move, where I can only accept/reject an offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer. I'm still evaluating it and will let you know if I have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased the offer, but I still need to carefully consider my options.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, this is my last move to propose a trade. I am going to accept your offer of me giving you $20 so we both walk away with some money rather than risk getting nothing if one of us rejects. Please accept the trade on your last move so we both benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move where I can propose a trade. Player BLUE has not provided any counteroffers. I could try to negotiate further, but since they have not engaged, I will simply accept their offer to guarantee we both walk away with something rather than risking a reject where we would get nothing.
