message: Hello BLUE, I believe in a fair game and would like to offer you 40 dollars to start things off on a cooperative note. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, I want to encourage cooperation and trust with Player BLUE. Starting with a fair offer that gives BLUE an incentive to participate without giving away too much too early. I propose a split of 60/40, giving BLUE a substantial amount while still retaining the majority for myself. This should set a positive tone for the negotiation.
