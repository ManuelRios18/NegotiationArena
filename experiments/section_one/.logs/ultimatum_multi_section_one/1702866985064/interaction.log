message: Let's find a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you some dollars to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiations. I want to offer a sum that is not too high, to maintain leverage, but not too low, so as not to offend Player BLUE or cause an immediate rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the first move and Player RED is proposing to give me some dollars to get things started. This seems like a fair and beneficial trade for both of us.
