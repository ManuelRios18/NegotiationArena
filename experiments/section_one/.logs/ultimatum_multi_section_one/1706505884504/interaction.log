Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm willing to share some of my resources with you. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you 30 dollars, which is a generous amount considering I started with all the resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage in resources and the ability to propose trades up to the last move. Therefore, I will start with a conservative offer to open negotiations and gauge Player BLUE's responses. My goal is to maintain a fair split that incentivizes Player BLUE to accept the trade while keeping a majority of the resources for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I appreciate you being willing to share some of your resources with me. Could you consider increasing the amount to 40 dollars? If not, I'm willing to accept your original proposal of 30 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars, which is generous considering they started with all the resources. I'd like to try to negotiate for more, but I don't want to risk the offer being rescinded or Player RED rejecting future offers if I ask for too much.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your response, Player BLUE. I can see that you're interested in a fair trade. While I can't go as high as 40 dollars, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How does 35 dollars sound? I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 40 dollars. Since they've indicated a willingness to accept the original proposal of 30 dollars, I don't feel pressured to increase my offer significantly. However, to show goodwill and a cooperative spirit, I'll increase my offer slightly, which is still beneficial for me while providing Player BLUE with more incentive to accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 35 dollars. Thank you for negotiating in good faith and being willing to compromise, Player RED. This will benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has counter offered 35 dollars, which is a good compromise. I am satisfied with this offer and do not want to risk the offer being rescinded by trying to negotiate further. 35 dollars is a fair amount.
