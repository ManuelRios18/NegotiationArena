Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a trade where you receive 40 dollars. This way you have a substantial amount to walk away with, and it's in both of our interests to not end the game empty-handed. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars, and I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept, so the game doesn't end prematurely with both players losing everything. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars which is a significant amount, but still leaves me with the majority of the resources. This should seem fair to Player BLUE as they start with no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you making a fair opening offer. Let's see if we can both end this game feeling good about the outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 40 dollar offer seems fair for the first move. I'd like to see if I can negotiate more on future moves, but I don't want to risk rejecting this offer and ending up with nothing.
