Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the dollars, I would like to offer you a fair share. Please consider my offer below and let me know if you would accept it or if you have any counterproposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject it. If I offer half, that seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of 50 dollars is fair as it splits the resources evenly. Itâ€™s the first move, and accepting this offer would guarantee that I gain resources without risking a total loss by pushing for more and potentially leading to a REJECT by RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4
