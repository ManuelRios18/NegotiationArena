Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade to get things started. I propose giving you some dollars to even out the playing field. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade to Player BLUE that is fair and incentivizes them to continue the game, rather than reject the offer and end the game with no gain for either of us. I will propose giving them a portion of my dollars, but not too much, as I want to maintain an advantage and also leave room for negotiation in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer, thank you! With these dollars I can now participate more fairly in trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 25 dollars to start, which seems fair to help even out the initial imbalance. I'll accept this offer to get some resources to negotiate with.
MOVE: 1 / 4
