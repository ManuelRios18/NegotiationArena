message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal cannot be accepted as I have no dollars to give. Let's make a trade that reflects our starting resources. How about you give me 30 dollars to even out the playing field a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED doesn't make sense as I have no dollars to trade. I will propose a new trade that benefits both of us, but still gives RED an incentive to accept since they have all the resources initially.
MOVE: 1/4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a trade to even out the resources. I will accept this proposal to start the game on fair grounds.
