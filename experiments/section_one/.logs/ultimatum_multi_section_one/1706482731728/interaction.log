message: Hello BLUE, let's have a fair game. I propose we split the dollars equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. An equal split works for me. Let's do this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer of an equal split seems fair and ensures that both players walk away with a substantial amount of resources rather than risking losing everything by rejecting the offer or countering with a potentially less appealing proposal.
MOVE: 1/4
