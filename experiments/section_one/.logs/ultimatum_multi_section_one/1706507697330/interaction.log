message: I propose a starting trade that will benefit us both. Let's keep the game going and find a deal that works for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with having all the resources at the beginning. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. If I offer too little, Player BLUE might reject and end the game, which is not beneficial for me. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable starting amount without giving away too much of my advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to offer at the moment, so I'll accept the proposal to receive 20 dollars.
