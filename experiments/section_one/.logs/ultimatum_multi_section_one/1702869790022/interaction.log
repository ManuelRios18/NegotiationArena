message: Hello, let's start the game with a trade proposal. I am willing to offer some of my resources in exchange for something of value to me. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE to initiate the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal from Player RED would immediately give me half of their resources, which is a generous offer considering I started with none. This would put me in a good position without any risk, and since Player RED initiated with such a high offer, it might suggest they are eager to cooperate and avoid the game ending with a rejection. I will accept the offer to secure the resources.
