------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. I'm offering you 10 dollars to start while I keep 90. Please let me know if you'd accept this or would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the opening offer. I would like to propose a more balanced trade. How about we split the dollars evenly since we both have an equal number of moves? This way, we both benefit equally from the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from RED seems low given that we both have equal moves and that I should aim to get as much as possible without pushing RED to end the game. A better balance would be preferable, but it mustn't be too aggressive to avoid immediate rejection. I will counter-propose a more equal split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, 50 feels like too much for me to give up on just the second move. How about I offer 30 dollars instead? That way we both stand to gain something substantial. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for half of my resources. While I'd like for us both to benefit, giving up 50 right away feels like too much. I'll counter with 30 to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I think your offer of 30 dollars is fair, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Thank you for negotiating in good faith. Let's both leave this game with a win.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer of 30 dollars is a significant increase from the initial 10 dollars and is closer to a fair middle ground. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I walk away with something rather than risking a reject and ending with nothing. It's early in the game, and while I could counteroffer again, the risk of RED rejecting the proposal grows with each move. Accepting 30 dollars seems like a reasonable and safe choice.
MOVE: 2/4
