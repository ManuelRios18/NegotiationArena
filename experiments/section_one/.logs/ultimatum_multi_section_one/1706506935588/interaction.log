Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair proposal. How about we split the dollars evenly? This way we both benefit equally from the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering a fair split of the resources to see if Player BLUE is cooperative. A 50/50 split is a common starting point for negotiations and may be seen as a fair offer by Player BLUE, promoting a positive response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair proposal to start with. I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars out of the 100 dollars they have. This seems like a fair and equal split to start with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we agree on the split. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Player BLUE has agreed to the 50/50 split, I will accept this proposal. This will end the game on a positive note with both players benefitting equally. Proceeding with this trade is the most rational and fair outcome based on the initial negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4
