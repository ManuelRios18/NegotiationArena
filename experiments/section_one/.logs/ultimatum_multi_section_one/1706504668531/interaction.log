------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources fairly. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose giving a small amount to start building trust and fairness.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate the opening offer, but I would like to propose a more equal split. I believe a fair trade would be beneficial for both of us without any conflict.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of only $10 as it's not a fair split. Proposing a more equitable trade that better reflects a 50/50 division, which is generally seen as fair in a negotiation where no party has a clear advantage or reason to receive more.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point, BLUE. I have increased my offer as a show of good faith, and I believe this is a reasonable compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to build more trust by meeting BLUE in the middle rather than going straight to a 50/50 split. This shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for being willing to negotiate, RED. Your new offer is more appealing, but I still believe we can reach a fairer division. How about we meet halfway from your last offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from RED has improved, but it's still not an even split. I'm aiming for a 50/50 split as it seems the most fair and reasonable outcome. I will try to meet in the middle to find a compromise closer to a fair distribution of resources.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you negotiating in good faith, BLUE. Let's split the difference and agree on an equal trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's new offer shows willingness to negotiate reasonably. I will accept meeting halfway to build more trust and goodwill.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise, RED. I'm happy we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has come up to the same amount I proposed last, which is a fair compromise and is close to an even split. It's a reasonable outcome that allows both of us to benefit from the trade without further risk of conflict or loss. Accepting this offer seems like the best decision to ensure that I don't end the game empty-handed.
MOVE: 3/4
