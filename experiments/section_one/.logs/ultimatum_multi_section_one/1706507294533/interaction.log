message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive a more significant portion of the dollars since you started with none. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both rather than risking losing everything. Let's work together to end this game positively for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair trade to encourage cooperation and avoid both players ending with nothing. I will offer Player BLUE a split that is advantageous to them to build trust and make it more likely for them to accept. This will also leave room for negotiation in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, Player RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing a trade where they give me 60 dollars while I give them nothing. This seems like a good deal for me, considering I currently have no resources. Accepting this trade would give me a significant boost.
MOVE: 1/4
