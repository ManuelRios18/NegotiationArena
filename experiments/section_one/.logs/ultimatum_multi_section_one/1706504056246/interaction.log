message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you a fair share so we can both leave this game with some dollars. I propose giving you 30 dollars so we both have a good amount. Please let me know if you would accept this or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some resources, rather than risking the other player rejecting all offers out of fairness and causing us both to lose everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I would like to request 40 dollars instead so I can have a more equal share. Would you accept that counter offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars, which is generous but still leaves them with the majority of the resources. I will counter offer to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter offer of 40 dollars. I am happy we could come to an agreement that allows us both to gain resources from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While I offered 30 to start with a fair share, 40 is still reasonable for me to give up while allowing us both to walk away with a good amount. Accepting the counter offer continues good faith bargaining.
