------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation. Here is my opening offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the dollars, so I should propose trades that benefit me. I'll start by proposing to give 10 dollars to BLUE, which is a small fraction of what I have but still valuable to them.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer. Let's see if we can find a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first move, so I need to carefully consider the proposal. I currently have no resources, so I should try to negotiate for the best deal possible.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the counteroffer. Let's compromise at 7 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with 5 dollars. I'd like to get a bit more, but I don't want to risk the deal falling apart or BLUE rejecting out of frustration. I'll meet in the middle as a show of good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I think I can push for a better offer. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is willing to compromise, but I still have no resources to start with. I need to try and negotiate for a better deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's meet in the middle at 6 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE came down just 1 dollar. I still have a lot more moves left and want to hold on to as many dollars as possible. I'll propose meeting halfway again - it shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I think we've reached a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 6 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is making a reasonable offer, and I still have no resources to start with. It might be best to accept this offer and secure some resources for future negotiations.
