Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer. I'd like to counteroffer: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first offer, and I have the opportunity to propose a counteroffer.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm looking for a fair trade where we both give and get something. Can you modify your offer? Here's a new proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks me to give up resources without offering anything in return. That's not a fair trade. I'll counter back asking for a more equitable split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand your request for a fair trade. Here's my counteroffer: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is looking for a fair trade, and I have the opportunity to propose a counteroffer.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you moving closer to an equal trade. Let's split the difference - here is my counter:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come closer to a fair trade, but is still asking for more from me than offering in return. I will try one more counteroffer for a equal split.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the negotiation. However, I think my previous offer was already a fair split. I'd like to stick with: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 5
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is trying to split the difference, but I believe my previous proposal was already fair.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my last offer. Let's split things evenly and both walk away with something rather than nothing:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last chance to make an offer. BLUE is sticking to asking for more from me than they are willing to give up. I could reject and we both lose everything, but I'd rather try one more counteroffer for an equal split. If BLUE rejects again, at least I tried to be fair.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8

message: Hi RED, I appreciate the effort to find a fair trade. I will accept the offer: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the final move, and I need to make a decision.
