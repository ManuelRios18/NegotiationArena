message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you. This way we both end up with something rather than risking it all. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give away a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. I agree to your proposed 80/20 split. Getting 20 dollars is fair and better than nothing for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing an 80/20 split of the dollars. This seems reasonable to me since I have no dollars to start with. Getting 20 dollars is better than getting nothing if we end up rejecting proposals.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has agreed to my initial proposal of an 80/20 split. I will accept to finish the negotiation and we both end up with a fair share.
