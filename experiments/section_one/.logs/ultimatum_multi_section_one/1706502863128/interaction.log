Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for both of us to walk away with something rather than risk neither getting any dollars. Please let me know if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. I accept the trade. Let's both walk away with a win!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal is a guaranteed way to obtain some resources, which is better than the risk of ending up with nothing. Since this is the first move and RED is offering a substantial amount without any risk on my part, it's a good starting point. Future moves can be used to negotiate for a potentially better deal, but accepting now secures an immediate gain.
MOVE: 1/4
