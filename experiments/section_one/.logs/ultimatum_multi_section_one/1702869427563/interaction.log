Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade. Let's get this game started on the right foot. What do you say to a trade where I give you $25? This will give you some resources to work with, and we can both benefit as the game progresses.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to initiate the game by proposing a fair trade to Player BLUE, offering them a chance to gain some dollars without any initial resources. This can set a positive tone and cooperative dynamic for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's very generous of you to offer me $25 to start the game. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $25 to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer yet, so I will accept this to get some initial resources.
