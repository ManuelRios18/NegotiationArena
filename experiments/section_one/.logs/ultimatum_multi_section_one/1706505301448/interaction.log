message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Hi RED, I accept your offer. Let's start the game with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opening offer from RED is to trade 10 dollars for nothing in return. I have no resources to trade at the moment, so I will accept this offer.
