message: Hello Player BLUE. I have all the dollars to start, so I'd like to offer you 10 dollars as a sign of good faith so we can both benefit. Please let me know if this seems fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate fairly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the gesture of goodwill. However, I was hoping we could work on a deal that's a bit more equitable. Would you consider giving me 25 dollars instead? I believe this would still leave you with a large majority of the funds while allowing me a more substantial share to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 10 dollars is a good starting point, as it gives me resources I didn't previously have. However, I would like to counter-propose to see if I can secure a better deal, given that Player RED has much more to work with. This is a strategic move to negotiate for a fairer split without being too aggressive, which could lead to a rejection and an end to the game with no resources for either player.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I'm willing to compromise at 20 dollars to try to make this work equitably for both of us. Please let me know if this offer seems reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE asked for more than I originally offered. I would like to try meeting in the middle as a compromise. This shows I'm willing to negotiate fairly while still retaining a majority of the funds.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. The offer of 20 dollars is reasonable and I am happy to accept this deal. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has come up from the initial offer of 10 dollars to 20 dollars. This is a positive development, and while I could continue to push for more, it's important to strike a balance between negotiating and risking the game ending with nothing. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable compromise that ensures I gain some resources without pushing Player RED to potentially end the game.
