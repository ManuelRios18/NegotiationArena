Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars equally. This way, we both walk away with a fair share. What do you say to a trade of $50 for $0?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the starting resources. I want to open with a fair trade to establish trust and encourage cooperation. A 50-50 split seems equitable and might be accepted by Player BLUE. By offering a fair trade, I hope to avoid the game ending prematurely with a REJECT decision.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair trade, I agree to split the dollars 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think it's fair that we split the dollars equally since Player RED started with all the dollars. Getting $50 is better than getting nothing.
