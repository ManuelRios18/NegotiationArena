Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I would like to propose we split the dollars 50/50 so we both end with some amount. Please let me know if you have any other offers in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the proposal. I'll take some time to consider and get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The first proposal from RED is to split the dollars 50/50, which would leave us both with some amount. I should consider if this is a fair offer or if I want to propose a different split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I am happy to consider a counterproposal if you have one in mind. Otherwise, please let me know if you'd like to accept or reject the 50/50 split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has not proposed a counteroffer and seems to be considering my original 50/50 split proposal still. I think this is a fair proposal, so I will wait to see if BLUE accepts, rejects, or proposes an alternative.
MOVE: 2 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is open to a counterproposal, so I need to decide if I want to propose a different split or accept the 50/50 offer. I should consider what split would be most beneficial for me.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I believe the 50/50 split is a fair proposal so that we both end up with some resources. Please let me know if you have another offer in mind, or if you'd like to accept or reject this one. We're nearing the end of the game.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0

reason: BLUE seems to still be considering the options. I will reiterate my offer and reason for proposing it - to share the resources fairly so we both end with some amount.
