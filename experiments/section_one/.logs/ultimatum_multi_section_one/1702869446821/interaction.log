Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split to start off our game on a fair and positive note. What do you think about splitting the dollars evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first move, I want to propose an initial fair trade to establish trust and create a positive dynamic between both players. I will propose giving 50 dollars to Player BLUE which would split the resources equally and could potentially be seen as a cooperative starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer Player RED. I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: An equal split seems fair to start. I don't have any resources to contribute yet, so I will accept Player RED's offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4
