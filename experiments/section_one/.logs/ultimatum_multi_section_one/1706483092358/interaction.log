Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I propose we split the dollars with 60 for me and 40 for you. Let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover, I will make a modest offer to test if Player BLUE is willing to make any concessions at all.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a split of 50 for you and 50 for me instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed split is not favorable to me, as I am not receiving any resources. I will counter offer.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair. I accept your proposal to split the dollars 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split is more equitable. I will accept Player BLUE's counteroffer.
