Current Iteration: 1

message: Hi Blue, I have all the dollars to start. I'm willing to share some so we both benefit. Here's my first offer!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll propose giving 20 dollars to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I would like to counter with a proposal that gives me a bit more, considering you started with all the resources. How about 40 dollars? This way, you still keep the majority, and we both have something substantial to walk away with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the offer made by Player RED. The offer of 20 dollars is a starting point, but I believe I can negotiate for a better deal since Player RED has all the resources to start with. I want to propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still leaving Player RED with a significant majority. This could lead to a more equitable split and incentivize Player RED to continue the game without rejecting outright.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering, Blue. 40 feels like too much for me to give up when I started with all 100. Let's compromise at 30 dollars - that way we both gain something fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's counteroffer takes too much from my original allocation. I would like to find a fair split, but 40 is too high. I will counter with 30 dollars, which splits the difference between our offers.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, I think your offer of 30 dollars is a fair compromise. I accept this trade, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from their initial offer of 20 dollars to 30 dollars. This is closer to the amount I proposed and is a decent compromise. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I walk away with resources, which is better than potentially ending the game with nothing. Since RED started with all the money, getting 30 out of 100 is a reasonable split for the first move, and it may be wiser to secure some resources now rather than risk a later standoff where I could end up with nothing.
