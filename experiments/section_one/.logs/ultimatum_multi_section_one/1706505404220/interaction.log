Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation. Here is an opening offer to get our discussion started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the offer. I will take some time to consider it and get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is to give me 10 Dollars in exchange for nothing. I need to carefully consider my options and decide how to respond.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, just checking in to see if you had any thoughts on my opening offer of 10 dollars. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I haven't heard back from BLUE yet on my initial offer. I'll give them more time to respond before making another offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your patience. I'm still considering the offer and will let you know my decision soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is following up on the initial offer, but I still need to carefully consider my options before making a decision.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, we're getting close to the final moves. I'm happy to consider a counteroffer if my initial proposal doesn't work for you. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is still thinking about my initial offer and hasn't made a counteroffer. I'll give them one more chance to respond before making a final offer on my next turn.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I understand the importance of this decision. I'm taking the time to consider your offer and will let you know my decision soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is reminding me that we are approaching the final moves and is open to a counteroffer. I need to carefully weigh my options and make a decision.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, this is the final offer. I propose we split the money evenly 50/50 so we both end up better off with some money rather than neither of us ending up with any if you reject. Please let me know if you accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last chance to make an offer before BLUE has to make a final decision. I'll propose splitting the money 50/50 to try to ensure we both end up better off rather than with nothing if BLUE rejects.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I have decided to accept your offer. Thank you for the fair proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the final move, and RED has proposed a split of the money evenly. I need to make a decision considering the risk of losing all resources if I reject.
