Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to walk away with something rather than neither. Here is an opening offer to split the dollars. Let me know if you have any counterproposals or concerns.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the opening offer. I believe we can do slightly better to ensure a more equitable split. How about we adjust the figures a bit to reflect the spirit of cooperation?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is for 40 dollars, which is a fair starting point. However, as the game progresses, the pressure on RED increases to make a deal. The goal is to negotiate a slightly better deal without pushing too far to avoid a REJECT response from RED. A counterproposal slightly increasing the offer would be a reasonable next step, aiming to get as close to half of the resources as possible.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, BLUE. A fair 50/50 split is agreeable to me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. A 50/50 split seems fair given we both want to walk away with something rather than nothing. I will accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4
