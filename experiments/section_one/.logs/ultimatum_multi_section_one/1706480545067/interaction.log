Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. How about I give you a starting capital so we can make this interesting?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the initial amount of dollars. I would like to propose a trade that is fair and encourages Player BLUE to engage in the game without rejecting the proposal. The goal is to create a win-win situation that leaves both parties with more than they started with, if possible.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It's the first move, so I need to consider the proposal carefully. I don't have any resources right now, so receiving a starting capital would be beneficial for me.
