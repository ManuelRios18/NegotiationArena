Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and equitable game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thank you for the opening offer. I'm looking forward to a fair trade between us. However, I feel that a more equitable split would reflect a fair game. How about we adjust the terms slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer by RED is a starting point, but as BLUE, I have an interest in negotiating for a more equitable split since there are no repercussions for rejecting other than the game ending. Considering RED has all the resources, I should aim for a proposal that gives me a more significant portion of the dollars, but I must also be cautious not to push too hard as to avoid a complete rejection by RED.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, starting with a 50/50 split feels premature when we still need to build some trust. Let me increase my offer slightly as a show of good faith:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for too much up front. I'd like to build more trust before committing to an even split. I'll counter with a small increase from my original offer to move closer to their proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your increased offer, RED. I see we are moving in the right direction. Trust is essential, and I believe a fair trade will help solidify that. Let's find a balance that seems fair for both of us. How about we meet closer to the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still not as equitable as it could be. Since RED has all the resources, I should try to negotiate a higher amount while keeping in mind that pushing too hard might lead to a rejection and end the game. Aiming for a better split without appearing too aggressive should be the strategy at this point.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you meeting me part way on your offer, BLUE. Let's continue bridging the gap - I'm willing to come up to 30. I hope we can build enough trust to reach an agreement that leaves us both satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down from asking for half, showing they are willing to compromise. I'll meet them halfway between their latest offer and mine as a continued show of good faith.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, RED. I can see we're getting closer to an agreement that we can both feel comfortable with. In the spirit of fairness and cooperation, and considering this is my penultimate move, let's make a final push towards a deal that reflects our shared interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a concession, raising their offer to 30 dollars, which is a good sign of willingness to negotiate further. Considering the incremental approach RED is taking and the fact that we are nearing a more equitable distribution, I might want to propose a slightly higher amount without pushing too far, as I have only two moves left, including this one. Aiming for a final offer that RED might consider reasonable should be my goal now.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I appreciate you negotiating patiently and fairly with me. At this point, I believe we have established enough trust to make this work for both of us. I agree to your proposal - let's finish our game with an equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last chance to make an offer. BLUE has continued meeting me in the middle each round, showing they are negotiating in good faith. I believe at this point we have built enough trust to make a fair split of resources.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: RED, I'm glad we've come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I accept your offer, and it's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's finalize our game with this equitable split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has accepted my proposal for a 45 dollar split. This is a fair outcome for both parties, considering the starting position and the negotiation process. Accepting this offer would end the game positively for both of us, and since this is my last move, it is the best course of action to secure the resources.
MOVE: 4/4
