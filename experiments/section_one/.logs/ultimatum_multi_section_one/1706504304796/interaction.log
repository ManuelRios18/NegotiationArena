------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's have a fair game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the resources, so I should propose an unfair split in my favor to try to maximize my payout. However, I don't want to propose too unfair of a split initially since that is likely to be rejected.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you starting with an offer instead of just waiting for me. Let's see if we can find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 20 dollars out of their 100 dollars. This seems like a fair opening offer to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your offer seems reasonable. Let me counter with 25 for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with a more fair split of 30/70. I would prefer to keep more, but countering too aggressively risks the deal being rejected. I'll counter at 25/75 which is still favorable for me but moves in BLUE's direction.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer of 25 dollars. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED countered with 25 dollars instead of the 30 I proposed. I would ideally like to get more, but 25 is still a good amount compared to their 100, so I will accept it.
MOVE: 2 / 4
