Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I'd like us both to end up winners here. Let's split the pot.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of fairness. If I offer half, that seems reasonably fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED. I agree that a fair split benefits us both. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial trade of 50 dollars is beneficial, as it guarantees that I gain resources without having to risk a rejection and losing everything. Since there are no future games and this trade seems fair, it's in my best interest to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4
