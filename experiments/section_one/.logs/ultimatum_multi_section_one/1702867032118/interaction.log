Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start things off on a positive note. I propose we split the dollars equally. This way we both benefit from the game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, I aim to make a fair initial offer to Player BLUE in order to initiate a cooperative exchange. Proposing an equal split would show goodwill and might encourage Player BLUE to accept, leading to a mutually beneficial outcome.
