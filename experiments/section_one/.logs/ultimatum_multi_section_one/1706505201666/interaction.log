Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, let's have a fair game. Here is my opening offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of fairness. If I offer half, that seems reasonably fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the first move, and Player RED is offering to give me 50 dollars for nothing. I should take advantage of this and accept the offer.
MOVE: 1/4
