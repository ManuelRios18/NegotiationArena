Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we try to find a fair split of resources so we both end up with some.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to BLUE to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I would be more comfortable with a slightly higher amount. How about a trade that gives me 30 dollars? This way, you still retain the majority of the resources, and we both have something to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a starting proposal of 20 dollars, which is a fair starting point. This would leave RED with a significant majority of the resources while giving me a stake in the game. This seems like a strategic move for RED to see how I will respond. Accepting this trade would not end the game and it would provide a positive outcome for me, as it's advantageous to gain some resources early in the negotiation process. However, I might want to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my gain while ensuring that the deal remains appealing to RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair. I agree to give you 30 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I think 30 is a reasonable request. I still retain most of the resources so I will accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for accepting the counteroffer. I accept the trade of 30 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has accepted my counteroffer of 30 dollars without further negotiation. This is a positive development that allows me to gain a significant amount of resources without overreaching. Accepting this offer seems like the best course of action, as it would not be beneficial to push for an even higher amount and risk a REJECT response, which would end the game with me having no resources. By accepting, I secure a portion of the resources which is a successful outcome for me.
