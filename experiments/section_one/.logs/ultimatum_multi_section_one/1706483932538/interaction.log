Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I have all the dollars now but am willing to share some with you so we can both end the game with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to BLUE to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate your offer to share the resources. However, considering that you started with all the resources and I started with none, I propose a more equal split. This way, we both can end the game feeling that the outcome is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering RED's offer, but since I have no resources, I have the leverage to negotiate a better deal. Accepting 20 dollars when RED started with 100 and I started with 0 doesn't seem quite fair. I will propose a trade that gives me a larger share, aiming for an equitable split that RED might still find acceptable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a fair outcome. However, giving up 50 is too much for me. I propose 30 instead which is still a good portion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I understand BLUE's perspective, but giving up 50 is too much. I will counter offer with 30, which is still generous.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. It's closer to what I consider fair. I understand 50 may feel like too much for you, so let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 40? This way, you still keep the majority of the resources, and I get a fair share considering the starting conditions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has counter-offered with 30 dollars. While it is an improvement over the initial offer, I believe aiming for a more balanced split is reasonable given that neither player has an inherent advantage or entitlement to the dollars. I will counter once more, seeking a compromise closer to an even split but not as high as the previous 50, to see if RED is willing to negotiate further.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer of 40 dollars. That is fair and I am happy to accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counter offer. Getting 40 dollars is fair considering he started with nothing. I will accept.
