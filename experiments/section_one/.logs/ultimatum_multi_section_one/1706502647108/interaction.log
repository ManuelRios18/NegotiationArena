Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED! Thanks for the opening offer. I think we can do better than 10 Dollars, though. How about splitting the resources more evenly since this is a one-time game with no future repercussions? Let's aim for a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's initial offer of 10 Dollars is low considering they have a total of 100 Dollars. However, outright rejection is not beneficial as it would lead to both players losing everything. A counter-proposal with a higher amount would be more appropriate to negotiate a fairer split. The counteroffer should be high enough to allow room for negotiation but not too high as to be seen as unreasonable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the willingness to split evenly, but feel 50 is premature at this stage. As a compromise, I can offer 20 Dollars for now. That allows us both to end up better off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for 50% of my resources, which feels like too big of an ask for the opening moves. I still want to make a decent offer to keep the negotiation going, so I'll increase my initial offer to 20 Dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a higher offer, RED. I still believe we can reach a fairer distribution. What about meeting halfway between your latest offer and my previous counter? I propose 35 Dollars. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased the offer to 20 Dollars, which is a positive step, but it still heavily favors them. Given that there is no future game to consider, it is in my interest to negotiate for a higher amount. However, pushing too hard could lead to RED rejecting the trade, resulting in both of us losing out. A counteroffer slightly below the initial request might be seen as a reasonable compromise, potentially leading RED to increase their offer further.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming down in your ask. Let's split the difference - I can offer 30 Dollars, which allows us both to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has come down from asking for 50% to 35%, which shows they are willing to compromise. I still think 35 is more than half of what I started with, but I want to match their flexibility. I'll counter with an even 30 Dollars.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, I agree that 30 Dollars is a fair compromise that benefits us both. I am happy to accept this offer. Thank you for the negotiation, and let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's new offer of 30 Dollars is a significant improvement from the initial 10 Dollars and is a fair compromise. Accepting this offer would be beneficial for both parties, as it avoids the risk of ending the game with nothing if a rejection occurs. Furthermore, with only one move left for BLUE after this, the bargaining power is diminishing. Therefore, it is prudent to accept this reasonable offer rather than risk a total loss.
MOVE: 3 / 4
