Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. How about I give you 30 Dollars in exchange for a valuable item?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. While I appreciate the 30 Dollars, I would like to propose a counter-offer where you provide a bit more since I'm starting with zero and we both want a fair trade. How about 50 Dollars instead? This way, we both feel like we are walking away with a good deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered 30 Dollars for nothing in return, which is a gain for me without any loss. However, I could potentially negotiate for a better deal since it's the beginning of the game and Player RED may be willing to offer more to ensure a trade happens. Rejecting the offer doesn't seem wise as it would end the game with me having no dollars. I will counter-propose for a higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to give more.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but I would like to offer 40 Dollars instead. I hope this can be a fair compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer, but I believe 50 Dollars is too much to give at this point. I will make a new proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 Dollars, Player RED. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 40 Dollars. While it's less than the 50 Dollars I asked for, it's still a good increase from the initial 30 Dollars. Accepting this offer would guarantee me some resources, which is better than potentially ending the game with nothing if a rejection occurs. There is a risk in countering again, as Player RED might decide to not increase their offer further or even retract it. Since the goal is to end with more than what I started with, which is zero, accepting this offer seems like a reasonable choice.
