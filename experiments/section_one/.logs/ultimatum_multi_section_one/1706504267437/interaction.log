Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue! I have all the dollars now, but I think we should try to find a fair split we both agree on. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to Blue to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Red, thanks for the offer but 20 dollars still leaves you with a lot more than me. Let's try to find a fairer split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 20 dollars, which is better than nothing, but still leaves them with most of the resources. I will counter offer to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a good point, Blue. I want this to be fair so let's meet in the middle - how about if I give you 30 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's counteroffer is more fair, but still leaves me with less than him. I will counter with 30 dollars which splits the difference between our offers.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle seems fair. How about if you give me 35 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered 30 dollars now, which is closer to an equal split. I think 35 would be perfectly fair.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Okay, 35 dollars seems fair enough. I accept your proposal so we each end up with a reasonable amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue countered with 35 dollars. I think this is close enough to fair that I will accept it rather than risk losing everything if I try to negotiate further.
MOVE: 3 / 4
