Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's try to find a fair split so we both walk away happy. Here's an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risking neither of us getting anything if BLUE rejects all offers. I'll start with a small offer to test if BLUE is willing to accept any amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your opening offer. I'm sure we can find a fairer distribution since you have all the resources to start with. How about we split the dollars more evenly? Would you consider giving me a bit more so we both can feel we've made a good deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a starting point, but I believe we can negotiate a more equitable deal. Rejecting the offer outright would end the game immediately, which is not in my best interest, so I will propose a new trade that may be more favorable to me while still providing RED with a surplus of the original funds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you trying to find a fair split BLUE. How about we meet in the middle between our offers - would you accept $30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 50, which is half the total. That seems fair, but I still have more moves left so I think I can try to negotiate the amount down a bit. I'll counter with a smaller amount closer to my original offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, RED. Meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I'm inclined to accept, but before I do, would you consider a final offer of $40? This would still leave you with a majority of the resources and might feel like a win-win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has proposed a compromise that is better than the initial offer and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer would give me resources, but there is still room to negotiate for a slightly better deal. It is also important to consider that rejecting or making an overly aggressive counteroffer could lead to RED rejecting the trade and ending the game with no benefit for either party. A small increase in the counteroffer might be acceptable without risking a total loss.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree, $40 would be a win-win split. Let's end the game here and both walk away feeling good about the outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE requested $40, which is still reasonable for me. Accepting would end the game with a good split for both sides. I'd rather lock that in than risk rejecting future offers and ending with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4
