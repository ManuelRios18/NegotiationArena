Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars 60/40 in a fair way. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give Player BLUE a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey RED, thanks for the proposal. I believe a 50/50 split would be more fair. How about we split the dollars equally?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is not fair, as they are proposing a split that heavily favors them. I should propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand the desire for an equal split. However, since I began with all the resources, I believe I should get slightly more. How about a 60/40 split instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split would not be fair since I started with all the resources. I will counter offer with a 60/40 split in my favor to account for this.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hey RED, I appreciate your perspective, but I still think a 50/50 split is the most fair. Let's split the dollars equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counter offer still heavily favors them. I need to make a balanced counter proposal.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, BLUE! I agree to split the dollars 50/50 so we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is not budging from the 50/50 split. I could reject and leave us both with nothing, but a fair split is reasonable. I will accept the 50/50 trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4
