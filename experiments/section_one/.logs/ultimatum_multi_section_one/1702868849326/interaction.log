message: Hello Player BLUE, I want to start this game with a fair offer. How about I give you $20 to get you started? This way we can both have resources, and it might lead to more favorable trades for you in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with $100. I want to propose a trade to Player BLUE that shows willingness to negotiate but also retains a majority of my resources. A 50/50 split is not strategically beneficial for me since I'm in a position of power. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars but still keeps me in a stronger position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

reason: Player RED is offering me $20 to start, which is a fair and generous offer. This gives me some resources to work with for future trades.
