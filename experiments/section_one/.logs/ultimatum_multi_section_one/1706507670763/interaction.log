Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair initial trade that benefits us both, considering I started with all the resources. Let's work together to end this game on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. My goal is to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, but I must also propose a trade that is tempting enough for them to accept, as a rejection would mean the loss of all resources for both players. I will start with a cautious offer that benefits me but still provides an incentive for Player BLUE to continue the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0

MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear you're on board with the initial trade. I believe we can both benefit from this game. I look forward to continuing our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 80
reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged my initial proposal, which indicates a willingness to cooperate. By accepting this trade, I would still retain the majority of the resources while also incentivizing Player BLUE to keep the game going. It's important to remain fair and strategic to avoid a rejection.
