message: Hello Player Blue. I am proposing we start small since I have all the resources. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose giving only a small amount to start in order to see if Blue is willing to accept a small amount or try to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. I would like to propose a slightly different trade to make the split more equitable. How about you give me $25? This way, we both walk away with something substantial, and it sets a good foundation for our subsequent moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $10 is tempting as it gives me some resources to work with. However, there is potential to negotiate for a better deal, considering Player RED starts with $100 and might be inclined to avoid a total loss by rejection. Proposing a new trade could lead to a more equitable distribution of the dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems like a fair counter offer Blue. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue's counteroffer is reasonable. Splitting the resources 25/75 is an equitable starting point. I will accept to show I am willing to negotiate in good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4
