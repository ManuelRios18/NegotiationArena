Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with 60 for me and 40 for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your fair offer. I accept the 60/40 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the proposal from Player RED. Since I started with no dollars, getting 40 dollars seems like a fair deal considering RED is taking a risk by offering to share without any guarantee I'll accept. I'm inclined to accept the offer to secure the 40 dollars, which is a substantial amount considering my initial position. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either side, and countering seems unnecessary and could risk a rejection from RED.
