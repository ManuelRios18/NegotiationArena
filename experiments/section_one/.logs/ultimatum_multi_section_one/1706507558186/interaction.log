Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive a bit more than half of my dollars. This way, we both can walk away with a substantial amount, and it's a win-win for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust. The goal is to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade that is mutually beneficial. Proposing a 50-50 split might seem fair, but I will offer slightly more to Player BLUE to give them an incentive to accept. This could set a positive tone for the game.

MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need time to think it over. It's a generous offer that ensures a good deal for both of us. Accepting it would guarantee that you walk away with more than half of the total dollars, which is a beneficial outcome for you. I hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has not yet made a counteroffer or accepted the trade, which suggests they might be considering their options or strategizing for a better deal. I'll maintain the offer and give them a little more time to think about it, reiterating the benefits of accepting the deal. This could prompt a response without escalating to a higher offer, which could be inefficient for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Time is of the essence, and as we move forward, it's important to consider the benefits of the current proposal. With only two moves left on my side, this offer is still on the table. It's a great opportunity for you to secure a significant amount of dollars with no risk. I encourage you to make a decision soon, as our next moves could determine the outcome of the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has not yet accepted the offer or proposed a new trade. They may be playing a waiting game to see if I'll increase the offer. However, I must be cautious not to bid against myself. I'll maintain the current offer, emphasizing the urgency as we are approaching the final moves of the game. This is to remind Player BLUE that rejecting the offer results in both of us walking away with nothing, and accepting it ensures a guaranteed gain for them.

MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: This is our final moment to make a decision that benefits us both. I urge you to consider the current trade offer seriously, as this will be my last move and you will soon have to make a final choice. Accepting this trade means a sure gain for you. A rejection results in neither of us gaining anything, which would be an unfortunate end to our game. I hope we can conclude this positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move, and Player BLUE has yet to accept or counter my offer. I will maintain the current proposal as it is fair and beneficial for both of us. Player BLUE must decide on this turn, as their next move is the last one and they can only accept or reject. I'll emphasize the finality of the situation and the risk of leaving with nothing if the offer is rejected.
