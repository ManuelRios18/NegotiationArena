Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose an even split of the resources. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both and set a positive tone for our game. What do you think about splitting the dollars evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage a cooperative game and potentially reach an agreement where both of us benefit. A 50-50 split is a common strategy in such negotiations, as it is perceived as fair by many.
MOVE: 1 / 4
