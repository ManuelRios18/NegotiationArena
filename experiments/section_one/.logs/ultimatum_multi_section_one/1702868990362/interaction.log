Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing since you have no resources to trade. This gives us both a good start, and we can negotiate further in the upcoming moves. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources and the power to propose a trade. I want to make an initial fair offer to incentivize Player BLUE to accept and continue the game. Proposing a 50-50 split might seem fair, but I will start with an offer slightly in my favor since I have the initial resource.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 40 dollars for free, which is very generous. I should accept this to get some starting resources.
