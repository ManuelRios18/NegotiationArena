message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose an equal split of the dollars. I think it's a fair start and sets us both up to leave the game with a good amount. Let's work together for a win-win situation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start off with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust between Player BLUE and myself. A 50/50 split seems equitable, and it might be an enticing offer for Player BLUE to accept, considering they started with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer to start with. I agree to the 50/50 split.
