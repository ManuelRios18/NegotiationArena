Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars 60/40 in my favor since I started with all of them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the dollars, so I should propose a trade that is somewhat fair but still favors me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I understand that you started with all the dollars, but I think a 50/50 split is more fair. I propose we split the dollars 50/50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade at the moment, so I'll propose a new trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer BLUE, but I believe I should get slightly more since I began with everything. Let's compromise at 60/40.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While a 50/50 split sounds fair, I still have more negotiating power since I started with all the dollars. I think I can still push for a 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hey RED, I understand your perspective, but I still think a 50/50 split is more equitable. Let's split the dollars 50/50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is sticking to the 60/40 split, but I still believe a 50/50 split is more fair. I will propose the same trade again.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Okay BLUE, 50/50 seems fair. I agree to split the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE seems set on a 50/50 split. I could try holding out for 60/40 again, but since this is my third move, I may want to just accept the 50/50 offer in case BLUE rejects on the next turn.
MOVE: 3 / 4
