Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. Here is an initial offer to split the dollars. Please let me know if you would like me to modify the offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer of 40 dollars. I accept since I have no resources to negotiate with.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I will accept Player RED's initial offer of 40 dollars since it is better than nothing.
