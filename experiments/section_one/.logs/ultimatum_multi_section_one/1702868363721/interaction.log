Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I propose we split the dollars equally. This way, we both benefit from the game. What are your thoughts on starting with a fair 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations. Offering a fair split can incentivize BLUE to accept, creating a win-win situation. I'm proposing to give 50 dollars, which is a significant amount and shows goodwill.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: That seems like a fair opening offer to me. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair to start. I don't have anything to lose by accepting this offer.
