Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that benefits us both. Let's start this game on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game and accept the trade. A fair starting offer may set a positive tone for the negotiations. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $40. This leaves me with the majority of the resources while giving them a substantial amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
