message: Hi BLUE, I'm proposing we split the dollars with 30 going to you. This way we both end up better off than just me having them all. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll propose giving 30 dollars to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Splitting the dollars with 30 going to me would indeed benefit both of us, as it's better than one player having all the resources.
