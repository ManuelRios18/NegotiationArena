Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly, 50 for me and 50 for you. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an even 50/50 split since this seems fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, RED. I agree to the even split. It seems like the fairest way to go about this. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer seems like a fair trade, as it is an even split with no loss to either party. It is logical to accept the offer as there is no benefit to negotiating for more, given that any rejection would result in both players losing everything. It also ends the game quickly with a guaranteed positive outcome for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4
