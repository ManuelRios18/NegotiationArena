Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair game. Here is an opening offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer, but I cannot accept it. I propose a new trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opening offer from RED is to exchange 10 dollars for nothing in return. I will reject this offer as it is not fair for me.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Okay, I can meet you halfway. Here is a counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with a smaller amount. I would prefer to give less, but I want to make some progress, so I will meet in the middle as a sign of good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thank you for the counteroffer, but I still cannot accept it. I propose a new trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a counteroffer, reducing the amount to 7 dollars. I will reject this offer as I still don't receive anything in return.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Okay BLUE, I can agree to give 3 dollars so we both end up better off. Let's make this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE came down even further to 3. I would prefer to give less, but I think 3 is reasonable for both of us to benefit. I'll accept it so we can finalize a deal.
