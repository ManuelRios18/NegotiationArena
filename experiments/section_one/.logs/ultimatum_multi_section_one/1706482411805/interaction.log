message: That's a fair offer, I accept. Let's have a good game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 30 Dollars if I give back 15 Dollars. This seems like a reasonable opening offer that gives me some benefit. I will accept it to get some initial resources.
