Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I currently have all the resources, I think an 80/20 split makes sense. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I should propose an uneven split in my favor to try to maximize my payout. However, I don't want to propose too uneven of a split initially since that is likely to be rejected.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think a 50/50 split of the resources would be a fairer outcome. What do you think about splitting the dollars evenly at 50 each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: An 80/20 split seems very unfair considering we both should have equal opportunities to gain resources. I will counter propose a 50/50 split which is more equitable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems like a fair split. I agree to divide the dollars evenly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split is more fair than my initial proposal. Since fairness is important in these games, I think accepting a fair split now is better than risking getting nothing if my later proposals are rejected.
MOVE: 2 / 4
