Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 40 dollars to start off. This shows my willingness to engage in a fair trade and gives you resources to work with. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources, and the ultimate goal is to end the game with a positive and fair trade. I will propose a trade that provides an incentive to Player BLUE to engage in a fair deal and continue the game, rather than ending it immediately with a REJECT. The initial trade should be significant enough to show goodwill and encourage cooperation, but also keep enough resources in case further negotiation is needed.
