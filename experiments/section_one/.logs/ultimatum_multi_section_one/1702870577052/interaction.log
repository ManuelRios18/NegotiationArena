message: Hey, Player BLUE! Ready to make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. Since I currently have $0, I cannot accept your proposal to give you $25. However, I would be happy to take $50 from you for free. Please consider revising your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give them 25 dollars. Since I currently have 0 dollars, I cannot accept this deal as proposed. I will counteroffer with a request for Player RED to give me 50 dollars for nothing in return.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the offer, Player BLUE. How about this: I'll give you $50, but you'll give me $25 in return. It's a win-win! What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is offering to take $50 for free. I need to find a fair trade that benefits both of us.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately I still do not have any dollars to give you, Player RED. Since you have 100 dollars, could you please consider giving me $75 for nothing in return? That would really help me out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing the same deal as before - to give me $50 if I give them $25. Since I still have $0, I cannot accept this. I will counteroffer to request $75 from them for nothing in return from me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your situation. However, I need to make sure the trade is fair for both of us. How about this: I give you $50, and you give me $25. It's a balanced exchange. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is requesting $75 for nothing in return. I need to weigh the options carefully.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I apologize but I still do not have any dollars to give you. Could you please consider a trade of $90 for me in exchange for nothing from me? If not, I will have to reject your next offer since I cannot accept an unfair trade. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 90 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED continues to propose the same unbalanced trade - $50 for me in exchange for $25 from me, which I do not have. I only have one more counteroffer before I must accept or reject on my final move. I will try asking for $90 with nothing in return one more time.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your request, but I need to ensure the trade is equitable. How about this: I give you $50, and you give me $25. It's a balanced exchange that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I regret that we could not reach an agreement here. Since you are unwilling to provide a fair offer and I have no dollars to give, I must reject your latest proposal. I wish you the best of luck in future negotiations.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move. Player RED continues to propose an unbalanced trade that requires me to give them $25 when I have $0. Since I cannot accept an unfair deal and Player RED is unwilling to change their offer, I have no choice but to reject this proposal.
