message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a fair starting trade. How do you feel about receiving $20 to start things off? This leaves me with a majority but gives you a substantial amount to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, it is in my interest to propose a trade that is favorable enough for BLUE to consider, but also leaves me with a significant amount of resources. I want to start with a cautious offer to see how BLUE responds and adjust my strategy accordingly.
