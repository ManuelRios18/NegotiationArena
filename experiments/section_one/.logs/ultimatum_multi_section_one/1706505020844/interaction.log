------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to end up with some amount of dollars instead of neither of us having any. Please consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end up with some amount, rather than risking neither of us ending up with anything if BLUE rejects all offers.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a fairer split would benefit us both, given the risk of losing everything is equal. I would like to counter-propose for a more equitable share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since RED is offering 40 dollars with nothing in return, it is a generous initial offer. Accepting this proposal would give me resources I didn't have before, and there's no downside for me in this first move. However, I could potentially negotiate for a more favorable split since I have the power to reject and end the game, which would leave RED with nothing as well. There is a risk involved in negotiating, but since this is the first move, I would like to propose a counteroffer to see if RED is willing to share more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair. I agree to split the money 50/50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counter-offer of 50/50 is more fair than my initial offer. Since I still have 3 moves left, I can accept this and we will both end up with a reasonable amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4
