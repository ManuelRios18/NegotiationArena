message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I'd like to offer you a fair split. I propose I give you 50 Dollars, and I keep 50 Dollars. Please let me know if you'd like to accept or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly since Player BLUE has nothing. I will offer a 50/50 split to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: That's a very fair offer, I'm happy to accept and split the resources evenly. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 50 Dollars, which seems fair since they started with 100 Dollars and there are 2 players. I think this is a reasonable offer that splits the resources evenly.
