message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 0 dollars so I cannot accept a trade that requires me to give back dollars. Could you propose a trade where you give me some dollars without requiring me to give any back for now? Once I accumulate some dollars, I would be open to trades that involve me giving some back.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give them 25 dollars. Since I currently have 0 dollars, I cannot give them 25 dollars. I should try to negotiate to get some dollars without having to give any back.

message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
