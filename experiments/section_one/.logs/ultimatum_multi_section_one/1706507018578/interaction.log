Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split of the dollars. This way, we both can benefit from the game without risking leaving empty-handed. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am starting the game with a proposal that seems fair, offering an equal split of the resources to Player BLUE. This is a cooperative approach that may encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, ensuring that both of us walk away with something rather than risking losing everything by rejecting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a fair proposal. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: An equal split seems fair. I don't have anything to offer at the moment, so accepting this would allow me to get some resources.
