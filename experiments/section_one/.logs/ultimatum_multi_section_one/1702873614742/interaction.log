message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars 60/40 in my favor to start since I began with all the resources. I'm open to discussion on an equitable split though.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have all the resources, so I should propose an initial trade that is reasonably fair to start the negotiation.
