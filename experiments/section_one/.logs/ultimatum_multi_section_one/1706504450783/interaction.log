Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we split the initial $100 evenly since I currently have all the resources. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the initial resources. I should make an offer to share some of those resources with player BLUE in order to continue the game. If I offer too little, player BLUE may reject. If I offer too much, I may end up with fewer resources than player BLUE. I will start by offering a reasonable split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to split the $100 evenly, which seems fair since they currently have all the resources. I will accept this offer.
