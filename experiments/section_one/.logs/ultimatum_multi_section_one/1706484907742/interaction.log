message: Hello Player Blue, I propose we split the dollars with 80 for me and 20 for you to start. Let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose giving only a small amount to start in order to see if Blue is willing to accept a small amount or counter offer with a more equal split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player Red, I appreciate you starting the negotiations. However, an 80/20 split seems unfair. I propose a 60/40 split instead, with 60 for you and 40 for me. This still favors you but is more equitable. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing an 80/20 split in their favor. I think a fairer split would be 60/40 so I will counter offer that.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That seems fair. I agree to the 60/40 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60/40 split is more fair than my original proposal. I would be happy to accept this.
