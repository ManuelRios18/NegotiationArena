message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose a trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: It seems there was a mistake in your proposal, as I have no dollars to trade. Let's correct that. How about we start with a simpler trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering whether to accept the initial trade offer or propose a new trade. Given that I start with no dollars, any amount of money gained would be beneficial as long as it's fair. The initial trade proposed by Player RED seems to be a mistake since I don't have any dollars to give. I will propose a new trade that gives me some initial capital to work with.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has pointed out the mistake in my initial proposal. I will go ahead and propose a simpler trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your trade proposal. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The new trade proposal from Player RED is acceptable as it gives me some initial capital without requiring me to give anything in return. This is a good starting point for me, so I will accept this trade.
