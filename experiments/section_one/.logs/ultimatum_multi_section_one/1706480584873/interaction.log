message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair offer. I propose splitting the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a good amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start the game by offering a fair split to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and to avoid an immediate rejection. Offering half of the resources is a common strategy in ultimatum games to show fairness.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I agree that splitting the resources evenly to start seems fair. I accept your offer of 50 dollars for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think it's fair that Player RED starts off by offering to split the resources evenly since Player RED has all the initial resources. This seems like a reasonable opening offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great! I'm glad we're in agreement. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 50
reason: Player BLUE has accepted the initial offer of 50 dollars, which is a fair and even split of the resources. Since the trade is accepted, there is no need for further negotiation, and I can accept this trade to finalize the deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4
