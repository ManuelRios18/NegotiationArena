message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose to give you 40 dollars to start things off. This way, we both have something to gain. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. I want to encourage cooperation and establish trust, so I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars without giving away too much of my initial advantage. It might be a good strategy to propose a trade that splits the resources in a way that is fair but still advantageous to me, considering I started with all of them.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 40 dollars to start, which is generous. I don't have anything to offer yet, so I will accept this to get some initial resources.
