Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a starting trade where I give you $40. This will give us both resources to play with and no one starts at zero. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I want to propose a trade that is favorable but also not too unfair to encourage cooperation. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, I need to provide an incentive for them to play along. I will propose giving them $40. This leaves me with the majority of the resources but gives Player BLUE a significant amount to make it worthwhile.

message: Thank you for the generous opening offer, Player RED. I accept and look forward to a fair and mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $40 to start, which is very generous. This will allow both of us to have some resources to negotiate with rather than starting with nothing. I should accept this offer to build some goodwill and get the game going.
