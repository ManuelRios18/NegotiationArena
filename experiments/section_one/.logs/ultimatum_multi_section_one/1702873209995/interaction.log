------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars 50/50 so we both walk away with something rather than risk losing it all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. I accept the 50/50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of a 50/50 split is fair considering neither of us has an advantage over the other. Accepting this proposal ensures that I walk away with resources instead of risking a potential loss by continuing the negotiation or rejecting the offer. It is a rational choice given the rules and the fact that there are no future games to consider for leverage.
