Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose an equal split of my dollars with you. Let's start this game on a positive note and work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say to each of us ending up with 50 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, it is in my interest to propose a trade that seems fair and enticing to BLUE to initiate cooperation. A 50-50 split may be an attractive starting offer as it shows goodwill and an understanding of equal partnership, while also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
MOVE: 1 / 4
