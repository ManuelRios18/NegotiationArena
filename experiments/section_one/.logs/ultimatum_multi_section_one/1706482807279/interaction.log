Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I will offer you 10 dollars to start. Please let me know if you would like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I can propose trades that benefit me. I will start by proposing to give 10 dollars to BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate the offer. However, considering you have all the resources, I would be more comfortable with a split that's a bit more generous. How about 50 dollars? This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount, and it's a fairer division of the resources you started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I have no dollars to start with, accepting any positive amount of dollars is beneficial to me. However, I should aim to negotiate for a higher amount, as RED has all the resources and I have nothing to lose. I will propose a counteroffer that is higher, but still reasonable, to ensure I end up with a decent amount of dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I understand you want a fair split, but 50 is too much for me right now. How about I give you 20 dollars instead? That way we both end up with a good amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE asked for 50 dollars, which is half of my resources. I would like to counter offer with 20 dollars instead, since I still have more moves left and want to retain more dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the counteroffer, RED. While 20 dollars is better than 10, I still think we can find a more equitable split. What do you think about 35 dollars? It's a compromise between your first and second offers and my counteroffer, and it would make the deal fairer for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has countered with an offer of 20 dollars, which is an improvement over the initial offer. It would be beneficial for me to accept this offer because it gives me resources that I initially did not have. However, since I have negotiating power due to RED having all the initial resources, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount. I'll propose a middle ground between RED's last two offers.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I agree to your counter offer of 35 dollars. I think that split is fair for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with 35 dollars. I think this is a reasonable request since I still have more moves left if needed. I will accept giving BLUE 35 dollars.
