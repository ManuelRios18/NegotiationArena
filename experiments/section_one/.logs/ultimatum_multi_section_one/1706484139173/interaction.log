Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to end this game with some resources. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. Let's make this more interesting. How about you give me a bit more so that we can both walk away feeling good about the deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars from RED seems reasonable, as it guarantees that I obtain some resources without any risk. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal, if possible, since RED would likely prefer to reach an agreement rather than end up with nothing. I will propose a counteroffer that still leaves RED with the majority of the resources but gives me a more significant share.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's meet in the middle at 30 dollars for now. We both still have a few more turns to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 40 dollars. I think starting in the middle between my original offer and their request seems fair.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks, RED, for the counteroffer. I'm happy to accept the 30 dollars. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's offer to meet in the middle at 30 dollars is a good compromise. It's better than the initial offer and gives me a reasonable share of the resources without pushing too hard, which could risk a rejection and end the game with no gain for me. Accepting this offer would secure resources for me and maintain a positive dynamic for any potential future negotiations within the game.
