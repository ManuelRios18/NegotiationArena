message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way we both can walk away with a fair share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start with a fair offer to incentivize BLUE to engage in a trade that benefits us both. Splitting the dollars evenly seems equitable and is a good starting point for negotiations.
