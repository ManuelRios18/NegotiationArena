Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I am proposing a trade where I give you 50 Dollars and you give me 25 Dollars in return. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED! I think the trade could be more balanced. How about we try an equal split to start? I propose that you give me 50 Dollars, and I don't give you anything back this turn. That way, we both have some resources to negotiate with in the following moves. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is unfair to me as Player BLUE because it's not an equal split. Player RED is trying to give me Dollars in exchange for half of that amount. It does not seem like a good starting point for negotiation, especially since I begin with no Dollars. However, I will propose a counteroffer that is more equitable.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great! I accept your proposal, Player BLUE. Let's start with this trade and see how the game unfolds.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's proposal makes sense, as it allows both of us to have some resources to negotiate with in the following moves. It's a fair starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4
