message: Hello, let's start with a fair trade. I propose a trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Since I currently have $0, I cannot give you any dollars. How about you give me $50 and I give nothing in return to start? That way we both end up with some dollars to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give them 25 dollars. Since I currently have 0 dollars, I cannot give them any dollars. I will propose a counteroffer where they give me 50 dollars and I give nothing in return.

player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 100
