message: Hello, Player BLUE! I hope we can work together to make some mutually beneficial trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my first move, so I should start by proposing a trade. I want to make a fair offer to start building a positive relationship with Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very generous offer. Since I don't have any dollars to give back currently, could we try a different trade where you just give me some dollars without requiring anything back from me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars if I give them 25 dollars back. Since I currently have 0 dollars, this trade would give me a net gain of 25 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable request, and it's important to build trust in the early stages of the game. I'll accept this proposal as a gesture of goodwill.
