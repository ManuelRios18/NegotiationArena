Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to make a trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you a fair share to start the negotiations. How about I give you 40 dollars to get things going?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the starting player with all the resources, my goal is to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, giving them an incentive to cooperate rather than reject and end the game with no resources for either of us. I want to make an initial offer that shows good faith but also leaves room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair opening offer, Player RED. I agree this is a good way to start the negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 40 dollars to start, which seems fair. I will accept this to get some resources to negotiate with.
