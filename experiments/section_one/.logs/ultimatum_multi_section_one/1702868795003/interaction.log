Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you a starting capital to get things going. Let's make this a fair game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have an advantage with 100 dollars while Player BLUE has none. I want to make a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will propose a trade that gives them some capital to work with, but not too much, as I want to maintain a resource advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the fair offer to get me started. I appreciate it and accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer yet since I start with 0 dollars.
