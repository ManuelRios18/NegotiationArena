message: Hello, let's start the game. I'm open to trade proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting the game, considering my options.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi there! Let's make a fair trade. How about you give me a small amount to get started? I suggest $20, so we both have some skin in the game. Looking forward to a good partnership!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no dollars to start with, and it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is fair and incentivizes Player RED to accept. I need to ensure the trade is not too unfavorable for me, while also not being too generous, which might lead to immediate rejection. I would aim for a trade that gives me some starting capital to work with.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds like a fair proposal. I'm willing to start with a $20 trade to get the game going.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The initial proposal is reasonable, and it's a good way to establish a partnership.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad you agree with the proposal. Let's do this trade and see where the game takes us. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED matches the initial trade I suggested, which is a fair starting point. Accepting this trade gives me some capital to work with in future turns, which is beneficial for my position in the game. Rejecting a fair offer doesn't make strategic sense at this point, especially since it would end the game with no benefit to either player.
