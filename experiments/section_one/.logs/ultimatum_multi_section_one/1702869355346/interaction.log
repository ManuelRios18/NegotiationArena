Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a fair share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I wish to initiate a trade that seems fair and encourages Player BLUE to engage in the negotiation process. By offering a split that gives Player BLUE an amount that is not too low, I'm hoping to build trust and increase the likelihood of a successful trade. Ideally, we'd both end the game with some resources. I propose a 50-50 split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Player BLUE has agreed to the initial proposal of a 50-50 split, I will accept the trade. This ensures that we both benefit from the game, and it is completed successfully without any losses.
