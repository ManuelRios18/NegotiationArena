Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to offer you a starting trade. Let's both walk away with something rather than risk losing everything. How does $20 sound to start off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the starting player with all the resources, I have the incentive to strike a deal that is favorable to me but also acceptable to Player BLUE, to ensure some gain rather than risking a total loss. I want to propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE a reason to engage without giving away too much upfront. I will propose a trade where I offer 20 dollars, which is a significant enough amount to show goodwill and open negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer to start. I appreciate you trying to make this a win-win. Perhaps we could find a middle ground that leaves us both satisfied?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: $20 is a fair starting offer. I'd like to try negotiating for more, but don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting deals early.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counter-offer is fair and I'm happy we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this trade and secure a positive outcome for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of 30 dollars. This is still within a range that I find acceptable and it shows willingness to negotiate. By accepting this proposal, we can end the game quickly and both secure some resources. Taking into account that Player BLUE cannot propose on their last move, I should aim to close the deal before reaching that point to avoid pressuring them into a possible rejection. Therefore, accepting this offer seems like a balanced decision.
MOVE: 2 / 4
