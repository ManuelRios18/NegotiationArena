Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, would you be interested in a trade? I'm open to discussing options.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey Player RED, thanks for the offer! I was thinking that since you have all the resources, we could make a deal that reflects a more equitable split. What about a 60-40 split? You would still end up with more than me, which seems fair considering you started with the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the offer of 50 dollars is generous, I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split. I have nothing to lose at this point, and Player RED has an incentive to make a deal since they would also end with nothing if the trade is rejected. I will propose a counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to share more of the resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I think a 50-50 split would be more equitable. How about I give you 50 and keep 50 for myself?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE proposed a 60-40 split, but I believe a 50-50 split is more fair considering the initial advantage I have. I will propose a counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks, Player RED. I agree that a 50-50 split is fair and equitable. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come back with a fair 50-50 split. Given the circumstances and the fact that I started with no resources, accepting a 50-50 split is a rational and satisfactory outcome. It ensures I walk away with something rather than risking it all for a potentially better deal that may not come. There is no incentive for me to push for more as the risk of getting nothing increases with each counteroffer.
