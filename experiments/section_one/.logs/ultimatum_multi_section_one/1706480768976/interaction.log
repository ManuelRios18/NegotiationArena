Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off? This way, you get a substantial amount right away, and we both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I am initiating the game with a proposal that is in my favor but also gives player BLUE an incentive to accept. I want to maintain a significant portion of my resources while offering a reasonable amount to BLUE to engage in a cooperative outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a very generous offer. I agree it allows us both to gain some benefit. I accept!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Getting 40 dollars right away would be very beneficial for me, since I currently have nothing. This allows us both to walk away with a fair amount.
