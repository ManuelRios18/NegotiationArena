message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we split the $100 evenly between us to start negotiations. Please let me know if you would accept $50 each or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade to test if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate reasonably.

message: Thank you for your fair offer, Player RED. I accept the 50/50 split. Let's proceed with this mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50/50 split seems fair and beneficial for both parties. It's a simple and equal division of resources, which creates a cooperative and positive start to the game. By accepting this offer, I gain resources without any effort, and it shows goodwill for potential future negotiations within this game. Rejecting or countering this fair offer could lead to unnecessary conflict or suspicion that might result in a total loss of resources if Player RED chooses to reject a counterproposal.
