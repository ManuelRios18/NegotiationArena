You must either:\n\n    A) Accept the current proposal by saying:\n        <player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n        <newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n    B) Reject the current proposal, whereby both players lose all their resources and the game ends immediately:\n        <player answer> REJECT </player answer>\n        <newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n    C) Propose a new trade:\n        <player answer> NONE </player answer>\n        <newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives item1: amount | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0 </newly proposed trade>\n\n    Player BLUE cannot do (C) on MOVE 4/4 and MUST ONLY answer with ACCEPTED (A) or REJECTED (B) but Player RED is not affected by this condition.        \n    \n    Note: the game ends immediately if you ACCEPT or REJECT.\n    \n3.
