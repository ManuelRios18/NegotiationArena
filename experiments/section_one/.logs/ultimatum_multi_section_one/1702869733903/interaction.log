message: Hello RED, I appreciate the opening move, but as I have no dollars to contribute, I propose a different trade. Let's start on equal footing and ensure both of us benefit fairly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade offer from Player RED is not possible since I have no dollars to trade. I will propose a more equitable trade considering the initial resources. I aim to establish a cooperative rapport.
