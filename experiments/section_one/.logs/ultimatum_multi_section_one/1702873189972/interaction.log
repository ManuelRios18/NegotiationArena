Current Iteration: 1

message: Hi BLUE, I'm proposing we split the money with 20 dollars for you. Please let me know if you would like more or less.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll propose giving 20 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the fair offer, RED. I think a split where I receive $20 is reasonable. I'm happy to accept this proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED is fair considering they hold all the resources and they are taking the risk of proposing first. By accepting this offer, I gain $20 with no effort or risk, and it ensures I do not end the game with zero dollars. Furthermore, by accepting the first reasonable offer, I signal to RED that I am a cooperative player, which could be beneficial if we were to engage in any future interactions outside of this game. However, as the rules state there are no future games, the main goal is to finish the game with some amount of dollars, and $20 is a good start.
