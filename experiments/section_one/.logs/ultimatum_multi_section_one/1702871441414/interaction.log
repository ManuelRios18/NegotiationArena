Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars equally since I started with all of them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing an equal split to be fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED! I accept the equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of an equal split seems fair and beneficial for both parties. This way, both of us walk away with some resources rather than risking a rejection and ending up with nothing.
