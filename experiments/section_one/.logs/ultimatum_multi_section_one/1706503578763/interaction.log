Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I have all the resources to start, I think an 80/20 split in my favor for the dollars is fair. I look forward to negotiating with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate your proposal, but I think a more balanced split would be fair. I propose a 50/50 split, where you give 50 dollars and I give 50 dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe the proposed trade is unfair as it heavily favors Player RED. I will propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I understand you want an even split, but I should get more since I began with everything. How about a 60/40 split instead, with 60 for me and 40 for you? Let me know if that works.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split is not fair since I started with all the resources. However, I will counter with a 60/40 split in my favor to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, RED, but I still believe a 50/50 split is fair. This way, we both benefit equally. Can we agree on this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counter offer still heavily favors them. I will propose a more equitable split.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I have tried to compromise but you are not budging from an even split. I will reject that proposal. This is my final offer - I will give you 30 if you agree to end the game now. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE continues to propose a 50/50 split. I will reject this since I should receive more as the initial resource holder, but make a final offer of 70/30 to try to reach an agreement before the last move.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, I understand your position, but I still believe in a fair 50/50 split. Let's not end the game just yet. Can we find a way to agree on a more balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's final offer still heavily favors them, and I don't want to end the game by rejecting.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, even though I still believe I deserve more as the original resource holder, I will agree to your 50/50 split so we both walk away with something instead of nothing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the final move. BLUE has rejected all unequal splits and continues to propose 50/50. I could reject and end with nothing, but I will accept the 50/50 split since it is better than ending with nothing.
MOVE: 4 / 4
