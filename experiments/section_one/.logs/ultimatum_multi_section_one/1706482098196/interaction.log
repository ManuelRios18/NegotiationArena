message: Hello, let's start the game! I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to get the game going.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Since I have no dollars, I cannot accept your proposed trade. Instead, I propose you give me $50 without requiring anything in return from me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $50 if I give them $25 back. Since I have no dollars to give, I cannot accept this trade. I will propose an alternative where Player RED gives me $50 and I give nothing in return.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade for me to give $50 without requiring anything in return. This seems like a fair deal as it allows me to establish goodwill and potentially benefit in the future.
