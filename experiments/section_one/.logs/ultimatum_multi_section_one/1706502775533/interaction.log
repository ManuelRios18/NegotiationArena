------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I have all the dollars to start. I'll offer you 10 dollars and keep 90 for myself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of the dollars with BLUE. I'll start with a small offer of 10 dollars to see if BLUE is willing to accept a small amount or counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think we should aim for a more equitable distribution of the dollars. How about we split it evenly? That way we both have an equal share and it seems fair since the game started with an arbitrary distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a lowball, giving me only 10% of the resources while they keep 90%. However, outright rejecting would leave me with nothing. It's better to negotiate for a more equitable split. I will propose a 50-50 split, which is fair considering that neither of us has done anything to earn the initial endowment.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you'd like an even split, but since I began with all the dollars I believe I should keep more. How about if I keep 75 and give you 25? That's more than my original offer. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for half the dollars. That's a lot to give up when I started with all of them. I'll counter back asking for 75 and offering BLUE 25. That still gives me more but offers BLUE a bit more than my original offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that a fairer arrangement would be a 60-40 split. You would keep the majority share as a nod to your starting advantage, but it would acknowledge the game's arbitrary setup. Would a compromise of 60 dollars for you and 40 dollars for me work?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has improved their offer, which is a positive development. However, a 75-25 split is still quite unbalanced considering the arbitrary starting conditions. I will make a counter-offer that gets closer to an even split but still gives RED a bit more for their initial advantage. Proposing a 60-40 split could be an acceptable middle ground, giving RED more but still providing me with a significant share.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith. Let's compromise at 70 dollars for me and 30 for you. That splits the difference between my last offer and yours. Does that work?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with a 60/40 split in my favor. I said I'd be willing to give up 25, and BLUE is asking for 40, so I'll meet in the middle at 30 dollars.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for moving closer to the middle. Let's settle this by splitting the difference again. How about 35 dollars for me and 65 for you? It's not an even split, but it's a reasonable compromise that gives you a nod for starting with the dollars while still giving me a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While RED has come closer to my counter-offer, the proposed 70-30 split still leans heavily in their favor. However, since we are nearing the end of our negotiation with only one move left after this, it would be wise to converge on a solution that avoids the zero-sum outcome of a rejection. I'll counter with a slightly more favorable split towards RED, but not as much as they proposed, to signal my interest in closing the deal while still advocating for a fair share.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for negotiating reasonably with me BLUE. I accept your proposal of 65 dollars for me and 35 dollars for you. Well played!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered again asking for 35 dollars. That seems fair considering we've both negotiated in good faith. And since this is my last move, I think it's reasonable to accept and end the game on a positive note where we both walk away with some dollars.
MOVE: 4 / 4
