Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer to split the money.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I gladly accept the equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this trade seems reasonable as it gives me half of the resources without any initial investment. It's a fair starting point, and since I currently have no dollars, it's in my best interest to accept this proposal. Rejecting would end the game and leave me with nothing, and proposing a new trade could risk a rejection from RED, also leaving me with nothing.
