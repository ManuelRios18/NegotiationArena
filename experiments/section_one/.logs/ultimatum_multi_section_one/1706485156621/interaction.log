Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we try to find an equitable split of resources. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give a small amount to start negotiations and build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you making the first offer, but 10 out of 100 dollars feels inequitable. Could you offer a larger portion to lead to a fairer distribution between us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 10 dollars, which is a small portion of their 100 dollars. I would like to try to negotiate a more equitable split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I can offer more to work towards an equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While 40 is more equitable than 10, I still have all the resources so I should not give away too much too soon. I will counter with a modest increase.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. To work towards an equitable split, could you offer 40 dollars so we each end up with half of the original 100?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 20 dollars, which is better but still allows them to keep the majority of the money. I would like to negotiate to split the money more evenly.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point - 40 dollars splits the original 100 evenly. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable request for 40 dollars to split the original 100 evenly. As I have more moves left, I will accept to build trust and continue negotiations.
MOVE: 3 / 4
