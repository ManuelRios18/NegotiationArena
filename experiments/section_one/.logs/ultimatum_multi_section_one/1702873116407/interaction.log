Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I am proposing we split the resources. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, I believe a fairer distribution would be beneficial for both of us, given that we both have an equal number of moves. I propose an equal split. Here is my counter-offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered $20 out of $100, which is a 20% split. This is a starting offer, and since I have 4 moves, I can counter-propose with a more favorable split for myself, aiming for a fairer distribution. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either player, and accepting would lock in a less than ideal split for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposed even split of resources, BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counter-offer of a 50/50 split seems fair given we have equal moves. I will accept this.
MOVE: 2 / 4
