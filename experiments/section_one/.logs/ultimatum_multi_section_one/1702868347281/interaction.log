Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both, how about you get a starting capital to work with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since the game has started, I need to propose an initial trade to Player BLUE to initiate the negotiation process. I will propose a trade that favors me but still gives Player BLUE some incentive to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I appreciate you helping me get started.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars to start with, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer yet but this will give me some capital to work with.
