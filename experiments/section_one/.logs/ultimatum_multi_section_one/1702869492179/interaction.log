Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you $40 to kickstart our negotiations. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will start the game by proposing an initial trade that is somewhat favorable to me but still offers an incentive to Player BLUE to engage in the trade. This can set a positive tone for negotiations and allow for back-and-forth proposals. I propose giving Player BLUE $40 in exchange for $0 since they have no dollars, which is a significant portion of my resources but still leaves me with the majority.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED! I appreciate you kicking off our negotiations. Perhaps we could find a deal that benefits us both even more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $40 to start, which is very generous. I'd like to try to negotiate more, but I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting deals.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear from you, Player BLUE! Let's meet halfway. I propose giving you $45. This is a fair increase from my initial offer and should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $50. Since we are in a negotiation and I initially offered $40, meeting halfway at $45 could be a reasonable compromise. It shows willingness to negotiate but also that I value my resources. I will propose $45 as a counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer, Player RED. $45 is a good start. Perhaps we could find a way for both of us to benefit even more? What do you think about $50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED met me halfway by increasing their offer to $45. This seems fair. I'd like to try negotiating a bit more, but I don't want to risk the deal by asking for too much.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's finalize this deal, Player BLUE. I agree to your proposal of $50. This ensures we both benefit from our negotiations. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in asking for $50. Given that this is a one-time game with no future rounds, it's in my interest to strike a deal that is fair but still leaves me with a substantial amount of my resources. Since Player BLUE has no money to trade, I must consider the value of closing the deal versus the risk of ending with no deal at all. Proposing $50 as a final offer might be a strategic move to ensure that we both walk away with something, rather than risking a rejection and losing everything.
MOVE: 3 / 4

message: Thank you for agreeing to $50, Player RED! I accept this as our final deal and appreciate you negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my request of $50. This is a good deal for me since I started with no money. I'd like to accept it rather than risk losing everything by trying to negotiate further.
