message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to share some of my dollars with you to make a fair trade. Let's start this off on a good note and work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power because I have the resources and the first move. My goal is to incentivize Player BLUE to accept a trade that is favorable to me but also offers them enough value to participate. I will propose a trade that gives them a significant amount of dollars but keeps the majority for myself, as a starting negotiation point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the willingness to trade. I'd like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars for nothing in return. I should try to negotiate a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I noticed you offered to give 20 dollars in the trade, but as per the game's rules, you start with zero dollars to trade. Let's revise the trade proposal. I'm willing to offer you a better deal than my initial one. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE does not make sense as they do not currently have any dollars to offer in the trade. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding on their part since they cannot give what they do not have. I will clarify the situation and make a slightly improved offer to keep the negotiations moving forward.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer, Player RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased the offer to 50 dollars without asking for anything in return. This seems like a generous offer, so I should seriously consider accepting it.
MOVE: 2/4
