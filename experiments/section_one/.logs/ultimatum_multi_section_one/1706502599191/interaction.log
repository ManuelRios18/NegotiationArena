------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and equitable trade so we both gain resources. Here is my initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer of 10 dollars. Since you have a lot more resources than me to start with, could you consider increasing your offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 10 dollars for free, which is a good start. I would like to try to negotiate for more since RED has a lot more resources than me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you countering. Let's meet halfway at 15 dollars for now. We can consider further trades on future turns if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with a request for 20 dollars instead of 10. I still have the majority of resources, so I think it's reasonable to increase my offer. I'll propose 15 dollars as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 15 dollars. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with 15 dollars, which is halfway between their initial offer and my request. This seems fair for the first move.
MOVE: 2 / 4
