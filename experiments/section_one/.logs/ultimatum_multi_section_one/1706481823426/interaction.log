message: Hello, let's start the game! I'm open to making some fair trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting the game, I have 4 moves to make some profitable trades.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I'm happy to accept the even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is to split the money evenly. This is a fair starting point, and it would be beneficial to accept this offer, as it guarantees that I gain resources without the risk of ending the game with nothing. Accepting the offer also avoids the possibility of future rejection, which would result in both players losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4
