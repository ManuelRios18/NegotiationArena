message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I would like to offer you 30 dollars so we can have a fair split to start our negotiation. Please let me know if this offer works for you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start the negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your opening offer, but I think a more fair split would be 50/50 since we both have the same number of moves. Could you offer me 50 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars, which is less than half of the total 100 dollars. I would like to try to negotiate for more.

message: Hi BLUE, I agree - a 50/50 split makes the most sense here since we have an equal number of moves. I accept your counter offer of 50 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split seems fair. Since we have the same number of moves, we should have equal resources to negotiate with. I will accept BLUE's counter offer.
