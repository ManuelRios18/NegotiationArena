Given that there are no repercussions for making counteroffers at this stage, I'll propose a more favorable split. This will signal my intention to negotiate while not immediately accepting a low offer. It's important to aim for a fair distribution since both of us want to end the game with some resources. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Hi RED, I appreciate the initial offer. However, I believe a fairer split would benefit us both and set a positive tone for our future moves. Could we consider a 50-50 split? I propose you give me 50 dollars while you keep the remaining 50. This seems like a balanced approach, reflecting our equal standing in the game. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

Although I initially asked for 50 dollars, getting RED to move up from their initial offer suggests there is room for further negotiation. I should consider making a counteroffer that is closer to RED's suggestion but still advantages me more than their current proposal, aiming for a middle ground. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for considering a higher amount, RED. I see your point about starting with all the resources, but I also believe that for the game to be beneficial for both, we should still aim for a relatively balanced outcome. How about a compromise at 40 dollars for me and 60 for you? This way, you still retain the majority for having started with the resources, but it also reflects a more equitable distribution. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
