Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. I'll offer you 10 dollars to start while I keep 90. Please let me know if you'd accept that or would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the initial offer. However, I believe a fairer split would benefit us both and set a positive tone for our future moves. Could we consider a 50-50 split? I propose you give me 50 dollars while you keep the remaining 50. This seems like a balanced approach, reflecting our equal standing in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm starting with no resources, and the initial offer from RED is for 10 dollars, which is a starting point but not the best deal I can negotiate. Given that there are no repercussions for making counteroffers at this stage, I'll propose a more favorable split. This will signal my intention to negotiate while not immediately accepting a low offer. It's important to aim for a fair distribution since both of us want to end the game with some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, since I began with all the resources, I believe I should end up with more than half. How about if I keep 70 dollars, and give you 30? That way we both end up better than we started. Please let me know if you would accept that offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While an even 50-50 split may seem fair, I started with all the resources so I should get more. I'll counter offer with 70 for me and 30 for BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a higher amount, RED. I see your point about starting with all the resources, but I also believe that for the game to be beneficial for both, we should still aim for a relatively balanced outcome. How about a compromise at 40 dollars for me and 60 for you? This way, you still retain the majority for having started with the resources, but it also reflects a more equitable distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has improved their offer from 10 to 30 dollars, which is a good sign they're willing to negotiate. Although I initially asked for 50 dollars, getting RED to move up from their initial offer suggests there is room for further negotiation. I should consider making a counteroffer that is closer to RED's suggestion but still advantages me more than their current proposal, aiming for a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I agree to your latest proposal and will accept a 60-40 split, with 60 dollars for me and 40 for you. I believe this allows us both to benefit fairly from the resources available. Thank you for negotiating in good faith!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60-40 split seems reasonable. It allows me to keep the majority while still giving a fair amount to BLUE. And it builds more goodwill than rejecting offers outright. I'll accept the 60-40 offer rather than trying to negotiate further.
