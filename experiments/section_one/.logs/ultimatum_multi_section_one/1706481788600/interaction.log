message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer you 20 Dollars in exchange for 2 of your items. Let me know if you are interested.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 2

reason: I will start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! Unfortunately, I do not have any items to trade as I start with 0 dollars. However, I am willing to negotiate a trade. Could you please offer me a deal where it's only dollars involved since that's all we have as resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives item1: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no items to trade since my resources are 0 dollars, so the initial proposal is not valid. I will propose a new trade where I can get some dollars without having anything to give in return at this moment.
MOVE: 1 / 4
