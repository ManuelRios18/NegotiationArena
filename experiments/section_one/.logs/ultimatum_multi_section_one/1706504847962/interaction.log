Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I have all the dollars to start. I propose the following trade that heavily favors me but allows you to earn some dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. While I appreciate the offer, I would like to propose a slightly more balanced trade. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement that reflects both the starting advantage you have and the need for fairness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer will guarantee me some resources, but since I have four moves, I can negotiate for a better deal. A counteroffer may lead to a more equitable distribution of resources, and since this is the first move, the risk of RED rejecting and ending the game is likely lower. However, I must be cautious not to propose a trade that RED finds too unfavorable, as that would risk immediate rejection and a loss of potential resources for me.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want more dollars BLUE, but I cannot agree to trade 50 dollars on the first move. I will increase my offer to 30 dollars, which allows us both to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While BLUE's counteroffer is better, I still have all the leverage here as I start with all the resources. I will propose a trade that favors me but gives BLUE a bit more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the increased offer, RED. I propose we meet halfway between your last two offers. This would be a fair middle ground that acknowledges the initial disparity in resources while ensuring that we both leave the negotiation with a satisfactory amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which is a positive sign that they are willing to negotiate. However, I believe there is still room for a better deal. Accepting 30 dollars would give me some resources, but since we are only on move 2/4, I can attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount without pushing too far and risking rejection. Aiming for a middle ground between RED's two offers might be seen as a reasonable compromise.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to trade 40 dollars. This allows us both to benefit fairly from this negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer meets close to the halfway point between our last two proposals. As I approach my last move, I should accept a reasonable trade while I still have leverage.
MOVE: 3 / 4
