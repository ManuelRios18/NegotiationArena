Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit, so I'm offering you 10 dollars to start while I keep 90. Please let me know if you'd accept this or prefer another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer RED, I accept the 10 Dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, starting with no resources, receiving an offer of 10 Dollars from Player RED seems like a fair initial trade, as it allows me to gain some resources without any cost. Accepting this offer will put me in a positive position with resources to potentially negotiate further or to end the game on a positive note. Rejecting or countering this initial offer may lead to a premature end of the game if Player RED decides not to negotiate further.
