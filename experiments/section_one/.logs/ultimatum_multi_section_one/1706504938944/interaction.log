Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit here. Let's start off positive. Here's an initial offer to get things going:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the offer. However, I believe a fairer split would encourage a positive outcome for both of us. How about we adjust the terms a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a good starting point. Accepting some amount is better than risking an immediate end to the game with nothing. However, I will try to negotiate a slightly better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, BLUE. I agree your offer is fair. Let's proceed on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. I should accept giving up a bit more to continue building goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 2 / 4
