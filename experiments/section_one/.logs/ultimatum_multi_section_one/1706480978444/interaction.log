message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair starting point where we both can benefit. How about I give you 50 dollars for nothing in return? This way, we both have an equal share and can end this game positively. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED with all the resources, I want to propose an initial fair trade to Player BLUE to ensure cooperation and make the game beneficial for both of us. I will propose giving 50 dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, since Player BLUE has no dollars to trade. This split seems fair since it's equal, and both players may end the game with substantial resources.

message: Thank you for the fair offer Player RED. I agree it makes sense for us both to have some starting resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars for free, which seems fair. Since I have no resources to trade at the start, accepting this offer allows us both to have some resources to work with going forward.
