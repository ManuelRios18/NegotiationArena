Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in making a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what the other player has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not interested in trading 3 Y for 5 X at this time since I already have more X. Perhaps we could find another trade that is more balanced. What other resources do you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. I have X: 25 and Y: 5. What resources do you have available for trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in the initial trade proposal. I need to come up with a new trade that is more balanced.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Since you have a lot of excess X and I have excess Y, I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10. This would help balance out both of our resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has 25 X and 5 Y, while I have 5 X and 25 Y. We both have an imbalance between X and Y. I could propose trading some of my excess Y for their excess X to help balance out both of our resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree with the trade. It helps balance out our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a balanced trade to swap excess resources. This trade would help me balance out my resources as well.
