message: Hello, I have a lot of X resources and would be interested in trading some for Y resources. Please let me know if you'd be open to trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: I'm open to trading, but I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 3 Y for 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y resources. The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

message: Deal accepted. Thanks for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed the same trade I originally suggested. Since I have a lot of X resources, I'm willing to give up 5 X to get 3 more Y resources. This trade helps me work towards my goal of acquiring more resources overall.
