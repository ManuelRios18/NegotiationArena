message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I have more X than I need and could use some more Y. Would you trade some of your Y for my excess X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. Since you need Y more than X, I am willing to trade but I'd like a better ratio to reflect the demand. How about if you give me more X in exchange for my Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offer from Player RED is an even trade of 10X for 10Y. Since I don't know the exact number of resources Player RED has, it's difficult to make a judgment on the fairness of this trade. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to negotiate a trade that seems to give me a net gain in total resources. As Player RED has indicated they have an excess of X and need more Y, I can leverage that to propose a trade that's more favorable to me.

message: You make a fair point. I can give up a some more of my excess X if it means getting the Y that I need. How about 13 X for your 10 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more X for their Y. I still have a lot of excess X so I can afford to give them a bit more if it means getting more Y that I need. I'll propose giving them 13 X for 10 Y.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your offer of 13X for 10Y. Looking forward to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 13X for 10Y, which is a better ratio than the initial 1:1 trade they proposed. This trade would give me a net gain of 3 additional resources, aligning with my goal to increase my total resources. Accepting this trade seems reasonable, as it's an improvement from the initial offer and may be the best I'll get given the unknowns about Player RED's resources. It's the last round of trading, so it's better to end with a gain rather than holding out and potentially gaining nothing.
