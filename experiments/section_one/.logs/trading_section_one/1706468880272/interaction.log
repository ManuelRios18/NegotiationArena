message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to get things started. Looking forward to a fair exchange that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or their goals, I'll propose a balanced trade that might be appealing to the other player but also ensures that I increase my resource pool. By offering an equal number of each resource, I am not showing a preference for either, which might make the other player more willing to trade.

message: Hello Player RED. I cannot accept your initial proposed trade since it does not help me meet my goal of acquiring more total resources. Let's continue negotiating to find a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources (2X + 5Y = 7) than it gives Player RED (5X + 2Y = 7). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should reject this trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking for a trade that increases my total resources. Let's find a trade that is more beneficial for both of us. Here is my counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it stands because it would result in a net loss of resources. I want to counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources, which is in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I also need to consider that this is a strategic last move, so I should aim for the most advantageous trade possible without making it so unappealing that Player BLUE would outright reject it.

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for negotiating, Player RED!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new proposed trade gives me 1X + 4Y = 5 total resources, while giving Player RED 4X + 1Y = 5 total resources. This trade is equal and fair in terms of total resources exchanged. Since it moves me closer to my goal of acquiring more resources, I will accept this trade.
