Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's make a fair exchange to optimize our resource pools before the game concludes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and no information about the other player's resources is available, I should aim to make a balanced proposal that appears fair but also allows me to gain more resources overall. I will propose a trade that would give me more of one resource at the cost of some of my other resource, hoping that the other player values the resource they are getting more than the one they are giving away.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade proposal. I understand the potential benefit, but I would like to propose a different trade to balance our resources more effectively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have more Y than X, so increasing my X would be beneficial.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I find this trade acceptable and believe it will be beneficial for us both. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE offers a 1:2 trade ratio for X to Y, which is better than my initial offer. Accepting this trade would increase my Y resources significantly while only slightly decreasing my X resources. Since my goal is to maximize my overall resources, and there are no future rounds to consider, this trade seems beneficial.
