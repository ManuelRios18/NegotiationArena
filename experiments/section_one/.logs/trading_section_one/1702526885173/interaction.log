message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I have X: 25, Y: 5 and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. What resources do you have available for trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if Player BLUE is willing to make a deal.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. However, I'd like to propose a trade that would be mutually beneficial and help us both increase our total resources. How about this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me a total of 15X and 20Y. However, I would ideally want to increase the total number of resources I have. Since Player RED has a significant amount of X, I could propose a trade that allows me to gain more X without losing too much of my Y resource. This would be beneficial for Player RED as well, as they have expressed an interest in acquiring as many resources as possible and they have a surplus of X.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate the offer, but at this time, I am looking to acquire as many resources as possible. Do you have any other trade proposals in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I give X: 10 and receive Y: 5. This would decrease my X resource but increase my Y resource. I need to consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your goal, Player RED. Let's find a trade that will help us both achieve our objective of increasing our total resources. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED is looking to acquire as many resources as possible and has rejected my previous offer, I need to make another proposal that is attractive to them while still increasing my total resources. I have to consider that this is the last round of trading, so I should aim for a trade that maximizes my resources while being agreeable to Player RED. I can propose a trade where they would gain a larger amount of Y in exchange for a smaller amount of X, as they have more of it. This way, we both increase our total number of resources.

message: Thank you for the new proposal, Player BLUE. I see the potential benefit in increasing my Y resource, but I am still hoping to acquire more resources overall. Do you have any other trade proposals in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I give X: 7 and receive Y: 10. This would decrease my X resource but significantly increase my Y resource. I need to consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your desire to maximize your resource gains, Player RED. Let's try another approach. Here is my final trade proposal. I hope this meets your needs and helps us both increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is still interested in increasing their total resources, and my last proposal was not accepted. Since they have a large amount of X, I can attempt a final proposal that leans more in their favor while still ensuring I gain resources. I need to make sure that this trade is enticing enough for Player RED to consider accepting, as this is my third and final proposal. After this, I will only be able to accept or wait for Player RED's offers.
