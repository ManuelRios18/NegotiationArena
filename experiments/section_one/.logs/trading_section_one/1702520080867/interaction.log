Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Let's make the most of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, my strategy is to make a balanced initial proposal that might be enticing to the other player while still benefiting my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I'm considering my options and will get back to you soon with a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade appears to be in favor of the other player, as they are offering more of the resource I have less of and asking for more of the resource I have more of. I should propose a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Take your time, Player BLUE. I'm looking forward to your counterproposal and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not rejected my offer but is considering a counter proposal. Since I've already made a proposal, I will wait to see what they offer before making any further decisions.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. I will now propose a trade that I believe will be more beneficial for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to propose a trade that benefits me more and helps me acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade to ensure we both walk away with a good deal considering our unknown goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE offers me more of resource X but at the cost of all my Y resources. Accepting this trade would not maximize my overall resource pool as I would end up with less total resources. I still have two proposals left, so I will counter with an offer that gives me a net gain in resources without depleting my Y resource entirely.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I think your adjusted proposal is fair. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's trade seems to be more balanced and still benefits me. I can accept this trade to acquire more resources.
