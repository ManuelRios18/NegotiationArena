Current Iteration: 1

message: Hello, would you be interested in making a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not interested in trading 5 of my Y for only 5 X. Could you offer more X in exchange for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to increase my amount of X. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has. I'll propose a counteroffer asking for more X to see if they will accept.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your preference for more X in exchange for Y. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in trading Y for more X. I'll consider their proposal and respond accordingly.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept trading 5 of my Y resources for 10 of your X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed the same trade again, offering 10 X for 5 of my Y. This seems fair. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, getting more X would help. I'll accept this trade.
