message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't have any information about the other player's resources or their goals, my initial proposal will aim to make a balanced trade that could be potentially attractive to the other player while also trying to increase my overall resources. I'll propose a trade where I give up a small amount of one resource for a larger amount of the other, hoping to entice the other player into a trade that seems fair.

message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading 10 of my Y for only 5 of your X. I would like to gain more resources overall, not reduce my total. Do you have a different offer in mind that could benefit us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I already have 5 units of X, gaining 5 more does not help me much in acquiring more overall resources. And I would be losing 10 units of Y, which reduces my total resources.

message: I understand your point, Player BLUE. Let's find a more balanced trade. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE does not align with my goal to increase my overall resources. Giving away double the amount of X for an equal amount of Y would decrease my total resources. I should make a counteroffer that would increase my total resources, even if it's by a small margin, while still proposing a trade that might seem attractive to Player BLUE.

message: This trade seems fair, Player RED. I agree to trade 8 of my Y resources for 7 of your X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a more balanced trade - they will give me 7 units of X in exchange for 8 units of my Y. This allows me to gain more X while only losing a slightly higher amount of Y. My total resources will be very slightly reduced, but it diversifies what I have.
