message: Hello, I am interested in trading but cannot give up any X resources. I can offer 5 Y resources though. Please make an offer with that in mind.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, so I can afford to give 5 Y. However, I only have 5 X resources, so I don't want to give any X. I will propose a counteroffer where I give 5 Y and receive 5 X.
