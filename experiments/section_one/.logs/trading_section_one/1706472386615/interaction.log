message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Turn: 1
message: Greetings! An even trade doesn't help either of us progress towards our goals. I'm interested in making a trade that's beneficial for both, but slightly more favorable to me since you initiated the trade. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed an even trade of X resources. Since this is the last round and the trade is even, it doesn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It could be a test to gauge my response, or they might be feeling out my stock of resources. I will reject the trade and propose a new trade that favors me without any knowledge of their resources. I need to be strategic with my proposal as I have a limit of 3 proposals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to trading with you again.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my even trade and countered with an offer more favorable to them. While I would be giving up more resources, their offer does provide me with some additional X resources. Since this is the last round, I should try to accumulate as much as possible even if I have to give up more. I will accept their offer.
