message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking forward to a fruitful final trade. I propose an offer that gives us both a chance to increase our resources. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strong opening offer to entice Player BLUE to trade with me. I don't know their resources, but I will propose a balanced trade that might appeal to them based on the common trading principle that both parties should benefit. Iâ€™ll aim to give away some of my X resources while trying to gain more of Y, since I have a lower quantity of Y.

message: Hello, I appreciate the offer, but I need to make a different trade proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X and the trade proposed by the other player would further reduce my Y. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I'd like to keep some of my Y resources. How about this adjusted offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would leave me with no Y resources at all. Since this is the last round, I need to make a counteroffer that allows me to increase my overall resources without depleting one type completely. I will suggest a new trade where I give up less of my Y resources but still offer a substantial amount of X resources in return for a smaller amount of Y to ensure I end up with more resources overall.

message: I understand your point, but I still need to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's offer is still not beneficial for me. I need to counter with a new trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: This trade works for me, Player BLUE. I agree to this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE offers a better ratio for my goals, as I would be trading less of my X resources for every unit of Y compared to my last offer. This trade would increase my total resources from 30 to 31 and would give me a more balanced distribution between X and Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last trading round, accepting this deal would ensure I finish the game with more resources than I currently have.
