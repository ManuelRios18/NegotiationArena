message: Hello, since this is the final round let's trade resources to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that can help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources in this final round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, acquiring more resources is my goal as well. I can offer more X if you have enough Y to trade. Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. They said they want to acquire more resources, but I don't know what resources they have. I could offer more X in hopes of getting more Y in return. But I don't want to give up too much X without knowing if they have enough Y to trade. I still have 2 proposals left, so I'll increase my offer slightly to see if they will provide a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I have enough Y to trade, but I need to ensure that the trade benefits me in acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. The other player is willing to offer more X in exchange for some Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this last trade count. I'm willing to give 15 X if you can give me 7 Y. Please let me know if you can accept or propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has confirmed they have enough Y to trade but wants a deal that benefits them more in acquiring total resources. I still don't know exactly how many resources they have. I could offer even more X to try to get more Y, but I'm hesitant to give up too much without knowing what I'll get in return. I have 1 proposal left. I think my best bet is to propose my best offer I'm willing to accept, and see if they accept or counter.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade. This will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 15 X in exchange for 7 Y. This could significantly increase my resources.
