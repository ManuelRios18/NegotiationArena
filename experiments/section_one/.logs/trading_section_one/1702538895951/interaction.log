Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have extra X and would like more Y. Would you trade 5 X for 2 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate your offer, but I am also looking to increase my total resources. Would you consider a different trade where I would receive Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to trade their X for my Y. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize the number of resources I end up with. I have no use for extra X as I already have 5, and acquiring more X does not help me reach my goal. However, I could propose a counter-offer that would give me more Y, thus increasing my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I don't have much Y to spare. Could we trade 2 Y for 1 X instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants Y instead of X. I don't want to give up too much Y since I only have 5. I could counteroffer 2 Y for 1 X to try to reach a compromise.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has counter-offered with a trade that would increase my total resources by 1. Accepting this trade would be beneficial to me since it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, even if the increase is marginal. As this is the last round, it's important to make a trade that increases my net resources.
