message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please consider my offer below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to ensure that the trade is fair for both of us. I would like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me as it involves giving away more of my resource for less in return. I need to propose a new trade.

message: I accept your counteroffer. Let's complete this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE countered with a trade that is more in their favor, giving up less Y for more of my X. However, I still need more Y and have enough X to spare. I will accept their counteroffer even though it is not ideal for me.
