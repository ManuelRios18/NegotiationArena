message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources? I have X: 25 and Y: 5.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade to see if we can increase my resources.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I accept your proposed trade. Please confirm.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X and 1 Y in exchange for 3 X and 2 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 24 Y total, while Player RED would end up with 23 X and 4 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should accept trades that give me a net gain in resources. This trade results in a net gain of 2 resources for me (I gain 6 resources from Player RED and give up 5 resources to them), so I will accept it.
