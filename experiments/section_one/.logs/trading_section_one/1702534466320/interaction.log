Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade of 5X for 5Y to start. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and try to gather more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Now we both have 10X and 20Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5X for 5Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.
