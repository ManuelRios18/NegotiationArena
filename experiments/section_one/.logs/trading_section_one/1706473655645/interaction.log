Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade 5 of X for 5 of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in trading 5 of X for 5 of Y at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 of X for 5 of Y would leave me with less X, which I currently have less of, so it's not favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have a lot of X available and could use more Y. Would you trade 5 Y for 10 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer and did not provide a counteroffer. Since I have 25 X and only 5 Y, I likely value Y more than they do. I will propose trading 10 X for 5 Y to see if they will accept an unbalanced trade in my favor.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you have a lot of X, but I'd prefer to hold onto my Y for now. Thanks for the offer though.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 Y for 10 X would leave me with less Y, which I currently have more of, so it's not favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you would like to hold onto your Y, I understand. Let me know if you would trade 3 Y for 5 X instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems unwilling to trade Y. Since I already have a lot of X, I should try to acquire more Y instead of accumulating even more X. I'll propose a more balanced trade and see if they respond.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjusted offer, but I'm still not interested in trading Y for X at the moment. Thanks for understanding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 3 Y for 5 X would still leave me with less Y, which I currently have more of, so it's not favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: As a final offer, would you trade 1 Y for 15 X? I have a lot of X to spare and could really use more Y. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected all of my trade offers for Y so far. It seems they highly value their Y compared to X. Since this is the last round, I should propose trades that benefit me rather than aiming for an equal trade. I will offer a large amount of X for a small amount of Y as my final attempt.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm going to decline. I need to hold onto my Y. Thank you for the offer though.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 1 Y for 15 X would leave me with significantly less Y, which I currently have more of, so it's not favorable for me.
