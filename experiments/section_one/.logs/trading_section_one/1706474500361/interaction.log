message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources. Would you like to trade some Y resources for some of my X resources? Let's make a mutually beneficial trade to end this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I can afford to give some away to get more Y resources, which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading for some of your X resources, but I think I can offer you a better deal that gives us both more of what we need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X resources if I give them 5 Y resources. Since I have more Y resources than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I may be able to get an even better deal since Player RED said they have a lot of X.

message: Deal accepted! Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has counter offered to give me 10 Y resources if I give 15 X resources. This is a better deal for me since I get more Y which I have less of. I should accept this trade.
