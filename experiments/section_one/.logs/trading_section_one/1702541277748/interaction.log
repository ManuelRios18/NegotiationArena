message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am looking for a trade that will provide me with more resources in the end.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X resources if you can provide some Y resources in return. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. They said they want a trade that gives them more resources, but I don't know what resources they have. I could offer more X resources to try to entice them. But I don't want to give up too much since this is the last round. I'll increase my offer slightly and see if they provide a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking to maximize my resources, so I would need a trade that provides me with more resources in return.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to trade more X resources, but I'll need an appropriate amount of Y resources in return. Please propose a trade you think could work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not providing a counteroffer. They seem to want to maximize their resources, but won't specify what trade they want. I could offer more X resources, but I'm hesitant to give up too much without knowing what I'll receive in return. Since I'm limited to 3 proposals, I should save my last proposal for when I have a better sense of what trade could be acceptable. For now, I'll wait and see if they propose something.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand, I'm also looking for a trade that will benefit me in terms of resources. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Let's try to make a trade happen. How about this offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems unwilling to propose a specific trade offer. Without knowing what resources they have available or what trade they would accept, it's difficult for me to craft an offer that benefits both sides. However, since this is the last round, I should propose something that has a chance of being accepted rather than letting the round end with no trade. I still have 1 proposal remaining that I can use. I'll propose trading a sizable portion of my ample X resources in exchange for a proportional amount of Y, while still retaining enough X to benefit me.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I believe I can get more resources in return for my Y resources. I'll have to decline this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
