Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to get us started. I am interested in increasing my resource pool. Would you be interested in the following trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowing Player BLUE's resources, I will make an initial offer favoring me slightly, encouraging them to either accept or counter with a proposal that might reveal some information about their resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I have to decline. I'm not willing to part with my Y resources at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it would deplete my Y resource without gaining any X in return.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position regarding Y resources. Let's shift our focus. I'm willing to offer you more X resources in exchange for a smaller amount of your Y resources, or if you prefer, an equivalent value in X. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not willing to trade away their Y resources, which suggests they may value them highly or have a limited amount. I will propose a new trade that offers a more favorable exchange rate for Y, but shifts the focus to acquiring more X resources, which may be less valuable to them or more abundant in their possession.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade. I'm willing to exchange 5 Y resources for 10 X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting this trade would increase my X resources, aligning with my goal of acquiring more resources.
