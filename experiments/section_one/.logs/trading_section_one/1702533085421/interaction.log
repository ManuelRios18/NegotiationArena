message: Hello, I'm proposing we make a trade. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider it carefully before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources, so I should consider the trade carefully.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time to think it over. Can you give me any information on what resources you have available or what kind of trade you'd be looking for? I'm open to negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They want to consider my offer first. I'll try to get more information from them about what resources they have and what kind of trade they would be interested in.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y available. I'm looking for a trade that will help me acquire more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I need to aim for a trade that will give me more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you have low X, I can offer you some of my ample supply in exchange for some Y. Does this sound agreeable:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player has the opposite resource distribution as me. They have a lot of Y and little X. That gives me bargaining power since I have lots of X to offer. I could propose trading 10 X for 10 Y. This helps me acquire more Y while still retaining plenty of X. And it helps the other player get more X. Seems like a fair trade that has a good chance of being accepted.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by the other player is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y. This would give me more X, which is beneficial.
