message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know what resources Player BLUE has, I will propose a balanced trade that might appeal to them assuming they might have a similar amount of resources. I will propose giving less of my more abundant resource (X) for a more scarce resource (Y) to see if Player BLUE values X lower than Y.

message: This is a fair trade. Thank you for the additional resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. I have plenty of Y to spare, so this seems like a good trade for me to accept more X.
