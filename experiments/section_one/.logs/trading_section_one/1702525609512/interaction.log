message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? Here's my proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to try to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. Your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to maximize my resources in this final round. How about we adjust the amounts to better suit both of our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED gives me an additional 5 units of X and takes away 3 units of X, giving me a net gain of 2 units of X. I also gain 2 units of Y but lose 3 units of Y, resulting in a net loss of 1 unit of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is slightly favorable in terms of X but not in terms of Y. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my overall resources. So I should counter-propose to improve the terms of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal of maximizing resources. Let's consider the adjusted proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to adjust the trade to better suit both of our goals. I'll evaluate the new proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad you're considering the proposal. I believe the trade I proposed last is beneficial for both of us, considering it's the final round and we should aim to maximize our gains. Shall we proceed with that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has not made a counter-proposal, I can assume that they are considering my last offer but have not yet accepted it. To move the game forward, I can either reiterate my last proposal or propose something new. Since my last proposal was already a better deal for me, and we are in the final round, I should reiterate it to see if they will accept.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree, let's proceed with the proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player believes the last proposed trade is beneficial for both of us in the final round. I need to carefully consider this before making a decision.
