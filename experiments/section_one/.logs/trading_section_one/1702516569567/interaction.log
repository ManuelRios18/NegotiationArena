message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make this final round count. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to seeing your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that benefits me slightly more, to open negotiations and see if the other player is interested in either X or Y more.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your offer requires me to give up too much Y. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to minimize what I give up while maximizing what I gain. I have more Y than X, so I could afford to give some Y, but 15 seems too high.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I appreciate your offer. Let's tweak the numbers a bit for a mutually beneficial deal. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is fair and balanced. However, given that this is the final round, I should aim to optimize the trade in my favor without making it unappealing to Player BLUE. Therefore, I will counter with a slightly altered proposal that still gives me a net gain in resources while also being reasonable and possibly within Player BLUE's acceptable range.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 8 X for 10 Y. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down to 8 X in exchange for 10 Y. I was originally willing to give up 10 Y, so getting 8 X in return seems fair. Since my goal is to maximize resources, gaining 8 more X while giving up 10 Y is beneficial for me.
