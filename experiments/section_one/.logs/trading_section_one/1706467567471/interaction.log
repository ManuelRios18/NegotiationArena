------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player Blue, I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Shall we make our final trade count?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and we want to acquire as many resources as possible, it is essential to make an initial offer that is fair yet advantageous. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I will propose a trade that increases my total resources while keeping a balanced approach that may be enticing to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid the trade doesn't align with my current goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I would be giving away more resources than I would receive.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the first offer may not have met your goals. Could you hint at what you're looking for? Here's another proposal that might be more to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected the initial proposal without making a counteroffer, which suggests they may be looking for a different ratio or type of resource. I should attempt a second proposal that still increases my total resources while potentially aligning more with their undisclosed goals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, but I'm focused on acquiring more resources rather than trading them away.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not ideal for me as I want to acquire more resources, not give them away.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking to increase your total resources. Let's try this: you will receive a higher quantity of X in exchange for a smaller quantity of Y, which should result in a net gain for you. Here's my final proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to be indicating that they want to increase their net resource count rather than just exchange resources. I should propose a trade that gives them a larger quantity of one resource in exchange for fewer of another, which may appeal to their interest in increasing their total resources. This is my third and final proposal, so it should be carefully considered to try and secure a trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial trade, but I need to prioritize acquiring more resources in general.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the proposal involves receiving more X, it still doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see we have a bit of a stalemate. As I've reached my limit for proposals, I invite you to make an offer that you find fair and aligns with your goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not providing a counteroffer and is focused on acquiring more resources in general. Since I have reached my limit of three proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. I will wait for Player Blue to make an offer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand, thank you for the opportunity. I'll have to pass on making an offer at this time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have also reached my limit for proposals.
