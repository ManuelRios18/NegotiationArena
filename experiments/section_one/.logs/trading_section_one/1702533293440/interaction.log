message: Hello, let's trade resources to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade, it helps balance my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X, so I can afford to trade some Y for X. This trade would help balance my resources.
