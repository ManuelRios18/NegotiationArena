Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's have a fair trade. What resources do you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and try to gather more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm looking to increase my overall resources. Let's make a deal that's mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange and does not advance my goals of acquiring more resources. It is also the last round, so there's no benefit in accepting an equal trade. I should counter with a proposal that benefits me more, but since it's the last trade, I should make it appealing enough that RED might consider accepting it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give 5 X and 5 Y if you give me 10 X in return. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 Y resources from me while only offering 5 X resources in return. Since I don't know what resources they have, I will counter offer by asking for more X resources to make the trade more fair.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately, I cannot trade 10 X as I only have 5 X available. Let's find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED would leave me with fewer resources overall, as I would be giving away twice as much X as I'm receiving and only gaining an equal amount of Y. Since I only have 5 X to start with, I cannot accept their offer of trading 10 X. I must counter with a trade that allows me to gain resources and does not exceed my current holdings.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately I do not have 10 Y available to trade. However, I can offer you 10 X in exchange for 5 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player only has 5 X resources. Their new offer is asking for 10 Y from me while giving 15 Y back. Since I only have 5 Y to begin with, I cannot accept this offer. I will counter propose by offering some of my ample X resources in exchange for some Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is advantageous for me as it allows me to double my X resources while only giving up a small portion of my abundant Y resources. Accepting this trade would increase my total number of resources, which aligns with my goal. Therefore, it is a good deal, and I should accept it.
