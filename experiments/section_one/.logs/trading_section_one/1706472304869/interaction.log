message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am looking for a trade that would benefit us both. I'm willing to offer some of my Y in exchange for your X. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is an equal exchange of the same resource, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. It would be more beneficial to propose a trade that allows me to gain additional resources. I will propose a trade where I give less Y in exchange for some amount of X, hoping that Player RED values Y more than X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That trade works for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to give up more of their Y resources for my X. Since my goal is to maximize resources, getting more Y would be beneficial. I can afford to give up some X.
