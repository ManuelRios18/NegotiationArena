Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we start trading some resources. I hope we can make some good deals!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing a small trade to test what resources they may have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a trade that benefits both of us more. How about this: I give X: 7 and you give Y: 5?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X to trade, and I have more Y than the other player is asking for. I could counteroffer to get more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering, but I value my Y resources more. Could we do X: 5 for Y: 3 instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade and countered with giving me more X resources for less Y resources from me. This could indicate they have a good amount of X to trade or value Y more. I'm hesitant to give up my Y so I will counter offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think we can reach an agreement with this trade. I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is valuing their Y resources more, so they are offering less Y in exchange for X. I could accept this trade as it's still beneficial for me.
