message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade 5X for 2Y. Let me know if this interests you or if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a small trade to test the waters.

message: Thank you for the offer. I would like to counter with a slightly different trade. How about I give you less Y for the 5X you're offering?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should focus on increasing the total number of resources I have. The current trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with a total of 28 units of resources (10X + 23Y), which is more than I currently have (5X + 25Y = 30). However, I believe I can propose a counteroffer that maximizes my resources even further. I will attempt to trade fewer Y for the same amount of X, thus increasing my total resource count without reaching my limit of three proposals.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with giving only 1Y for 5X. Since I have a lot more X than Y, getting even 1 more Y would be beneficial. I'll accept this trade.
