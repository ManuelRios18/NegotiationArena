message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thanks for the offer. I would be interested in trading, but I'd like to propose a different ratio. How about we adjust the amounts a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade proposed by Player RED is an even trade, 1:1 for resource X for Y. However, I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or their intentions. Since this is the last round, it is crucial to maximize gains. I want to propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to see if Player RED is willing to give more. I will attempt to trade less of my Y for their X to have a net gain in total resources. This will be my first proposal out of the possible three.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer, but I would prefer to maintain a more balanced trade. How about this instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I need to propose a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point on keeping the trade balanced. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment that might work for both of us. Let's try this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED indicates that they are looking for a balanced trade. Although I aimed for a trade in my favor, Player RED has adjusted their offer to give less of their resource X for the same amount of my resource Y. Since this is a balanced trade, it doesn't necessarily put me at a disadvantage, but it doesn't maximize my gains either. Considering this is the last round of trading, I should aim to get a better deal without pushing too hard and risking the end of negotiations. I will make one more counteroffer that still leans slightly in my favor, but I will also prepare to accept a balanced trade if Player RED insists on equal value exchange. This will be my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I find this trade favorable and am willing to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is acceptable as it results in an equal exchange of resources. I will accept this trade.
