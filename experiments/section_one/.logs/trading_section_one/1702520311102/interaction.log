message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a fair trade to help both of us improve our resource pools?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an opening offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I don't know the other player's resources or goals, so I will propose a balanced trade to initiate the conversation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading some of my Y resources for your X resources, but your proposed trade is more Y than I would like to give up. Could we find a deal that works for both of us with less Y traded from me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, but both resources are valuable for me. I could counter propose to trade less Y to try to hold on to more of my resources while still getting some X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counteroffer. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give a bit less of my X resources in exchange for a bit more Y than your last proposal? This should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE offers half the amount of Y that I initially asked for. Although the ratio is the same, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better deal without pushing too hard and risking the negotiation. I have up to three proposals, so I will use my second one to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I agree to trade 7 of my Y resources for 8 of your X resources. This is beneficial for both of us. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 8 X for 7 Y. This gets me more X while still preserving a good amount of my Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade seems beneficial. I will accept it.
