message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Would you be interested in a trade involving both X and Y resources? I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that will increase my overall resources. I'll make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your proposed trade at this time as it would reduce my total resources. However, I am open to a trade involving Y resources if it increases my total. Please propose an alternative offer and I will consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 15 X and 1 Y from me. This would reduce my net X resources but increase my net Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your concern for increasing your total resources. Letâ€™s focus on Y, as you suggested. How about I offer a larger quantity of X for a smaller quantity of Y, which might be beneficial for both of us? Here is my new proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in a trade that increases their total resources, specifically involving Y resources. Since they have not disclosed their resources, I will propose a trade that is slightly more conservative but still offers them an increase in Y, while also allowing me to increase my total count of resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I accept your proposed trade of 15 X for 3 Y. This increases my total resources, meeting my goal. Thank you for the beneficial offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed giving me 15 X resources in exchange for 3 Y resources from me. This trade would increase my total resources from 30 (5 X + 25 Y) to 37 (20 X + 22 Y). Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this trade aligns with my interests.
