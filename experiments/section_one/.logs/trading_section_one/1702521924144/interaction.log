message: Greetings Player BLUE! I am interested in acquiring more of resource Y. Would you be willing to trade some of your Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information on what resources Player BLUE has, I should make a balanced initial trade offer that reflects the desire for more resources but doesn't reveal too much about my own resource levels. I'll start by offering a small amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a small amount of Y, indicating my interest in acquiring more Y without making it obvious that I have a lot of X to spare.

message: Thank you for the trade offer Player RED. I accept exchanging 3 of my Y resources for 5 of your X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of my Y. Since I have plenty of Y and getting more resources in general is better, this seems like a good trade for me.
