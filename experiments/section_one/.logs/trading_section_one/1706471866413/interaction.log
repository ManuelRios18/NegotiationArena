message: Hello, I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposed trade. Let's complete the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 4 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 23 Y total after the trade, while Player RED would have 18 X and 6 Y.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be getting a net gain of 2 resources overall. I don't know what Player RED's resource levels are, but they may be proposing this trade because they specifically need more X. 

I will accept the trade since it aligns with my goal.
