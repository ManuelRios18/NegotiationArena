message: Hello, since this is our last chance to trade resources, I'd like to propose a mutually beneficial trade. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Hello, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in this final trade. Do you have any other proposals in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 X and 25 Y. I want to maximize my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, since this is the last chance let's make the most of it. How about this offer instead:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a better trade to acquire more resources. I have a lot of X to spare so I can offer more. However, I should still start relatively small in case they have limited resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer. I'd like to balance the trade a bit more. How about Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 X and 25 Y. I want to maximize my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted! I look forward to trading resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a trade of 8 X for 5 Y. This seems fair considering I have a lot more X. Acquiring more Y will help me towards my goal. I will accept this trade.
