message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust accordingly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly, to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I have less X than you requested but can offer more Y. Please let me know if the following counteroffer works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y, while asking for 12 X and 3 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could counteroffer to give more Y and less X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see you have a good amount of Y to offer. How about we adjust the amounts slightly to reflect a more balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE doesn't meet my initial proposal's value, as they're offering less X and only slightly more Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and Y seems to be more abundant for Player BLUE, I will try to negotiate a trade that gives me a greater overall quantity of resources while still maintaining a good balance. I have two more proposals left.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your latest offer as I believe it is a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has adjusted their offer to give 8 X and 1 Y while asking for 8 X and 4 Y from me. This seems like a fair trade since we are exchanging equal X, and I have more Y to spare than they have X. I will accept this offer.
