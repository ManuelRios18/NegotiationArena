message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources to benefit both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 1 unit of Y from me. This would result in a net gain of 3 units of X and 1 unit of Y for me, helping me acquire more resources overall.
