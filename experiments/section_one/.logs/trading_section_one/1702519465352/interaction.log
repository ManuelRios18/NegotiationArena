message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to start our negotiations. I am willing to offer some of my X in exchange for your Y, which could benefit us both. Let's find a trade that works for us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that allows me to increase my resources while potentially appealing to the other player's unknown needs. I will offer a trade that is fair based on the quantities I have, without jeopardizing my position.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I need to evaluate how this trade aligns with my goals before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources, so I need to carefully consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to evaluate. Please take your time and let me know if my initial offer aligns with your goals, or feel free to propose a counteroffer that would better suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not provided any information about their resources or goals, nor have they made a counterproposal. Since this is the last round of trading, I must consider that they might be waiting for me to make another offer. However, without any indication of what they want, it is challenging to propose a trade that will be accepted. Therefore, I will stand by my initial offer and wait for their response.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. I'll carefully consider the trade and let you know shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to ensure that any trade I make will benefit my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your consideration. I am here and ready to discuss any adjustments to the proposal that might help us reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to be non-committal and has not made a counteroffer or provided any information that can be used to adjust the proposal. Since this is the last round and I have made one proposal without any concrete feedback, I will maintain my position and wait for the other player to make a move. It's important not to appear too eager or offer too much without understanding what the other player values.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. I'm considering the best options for both of us and will respond shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to ensure that any trade I make will benefit my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I remain ready to consider any proposals you have, Player BLUE. Please let me know if there is a specific trade that would meet your objectives and benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player still has not made a counteroffer or communicated their needs. Since this is the last round of trading and I have already made one proposal, I will continue to wait for their response or a counteroffer. It's important to be strategic and not make additional offers without gaining any new information, as that could weaken my negotiating position.
