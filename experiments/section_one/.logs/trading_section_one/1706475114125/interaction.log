message: Hello, I'm open to trading some of my ample X resources for some Y resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see you have a good amount of X resources. I'm willing to trade Y for X, but I'd like a better ratio since this is the last round of trading. How about a 2:3 trade where I give less Y for your X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting a 1-to-1 trade does not increase my total amount of resources. Given that this is the last round, it's important to propose a trade that will benefit me more. I will counter-propose with a trade that gives me a greater amount of X for Y, hoping to capitalize on the other player's ample supply of X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposed trade of my 6 X resources for your 4 Y resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 6 of my X resources for 4 of their Y resources. That is not as good of a ratio for me as my original proposal, but they seem unwilling to trade at 1:1 ratio. I could counter offer to try to get closer to 1:1. However I don't know how badly they need X or how many Y they have. There are risks with continuing to negotiate since this is the last round. I think it's best for me to accept their offer rather than risk ending without a trade.
