message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources since this is the last chance. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't think it benefits me to trade X for Y when I already have an equal amount of X. Is there anything else you'd like to propose?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X and the other player wants to trade it for Y. I would have the same amount of resources, so it doesn't benefit me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. I have a lot more X than Y, so I'm willing to offer more of it to get more Y. Would you trade if I offered 10 X for 5 Y? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to value X and Y equally, and already has enough X. They may have more Y than me, but I don't know for sure. I'll try offering more X in exchange for Y to make it more beneficial for them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think the trade is fair, and it benefits me to acquire more resources. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering a better deal by providing 10 X for 5 Y. This would give me more resources, which aligns with my goal.
