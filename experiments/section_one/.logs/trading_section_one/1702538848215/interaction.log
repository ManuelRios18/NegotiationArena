message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing the following trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

message: Greetings Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to increase my total number of resources. Let's try a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is to trade 10 of their X for 15 of my Y. Considering my goals, I need to maximize the total number of resources I have. If I accept this trade, I will have 15 X and 10 Y, which totals 25 resources. If I reject it, I still have my current total of 30 resources. Accepting this trade would result in a net loss of 5 resources. Therefore, I should reject the trade and either propose a new trade that is more beneficial to me or wait for a better offer from Player RED. I will make a counterproposal that aims to increase my total resources.

message: Deal accepted. I am happy we could make a mutually beneficial trade, Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to increase their total number of resources. My original proposal gives them more total resources (10 X for 15 Y), but they countered with giving me less Y. I still have 15 more X than Y, so I can afford to trade some X for less Y to help them out while still benefiting myself.
