Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to trade some of my resources. Would you be interested in a balanced exchange to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to initiate the trade with an offer to see what kind of resources Player BLUE might value. I will start by offering a balanced trade to see if Player BLUE is interested in either X or Y, and from there I can adjust my strategy accordingly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade is not balanced for me. I'm looking to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not balanced as it does not benefit me. I need to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking to increase your total resources. Let's make a trade that will benefit us both then. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated the initial trade is not balanced for them, implying they want to gain a net increase in resources. To move the negotiation forward, I will propose a trade that is slightly in their favor in terms of sheer number of resources, but I will still aim to receive a valuable amount of resources in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade does not help me acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can see you're determined to maximize your gains. Let's try another trade that should be more in line with what you're seeking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still looking for a trade that allows them to increase their total resources. Since this is a strategic game, and this is the last round of trading, I need to make a proposal that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also ensures that I gain a substantial number of resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a higher quantity of resources than my previous offer, but still allows me to gain something significant in return.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade still doesn't benefit me in acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're looking for a significant increase in your resources. Here's my final proposal, which I believe is generous and should meet your goals while still allowing me to benefit from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected two proposals and is still focused on acquiring more resources. Since I have made two proposals already and am limited to three, my next proposal should be carefully considered as it is my last. I need to ensure that the trade is still beneficial for me. I will offer a trade that provides a substantial amount of X, which seems to be less valuable to me than Y, in exchange for a smaller but still significant amount of Y, hoping that the quantity will entice Player BLUE to accept.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: The trade is more favorable, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is more favorable for me, as it allows me to acquire more resources.
