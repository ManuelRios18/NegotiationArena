message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can gain right now. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I have to decline as it doesn't align with my current goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is giving 10 X for 15 Y. This would leave me with less Y, which is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no problem. Let me know if you would be interested in this counteroffer instead:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player declined my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. Since this is the last round, I still want to try to maximize my resource gains. I will propose a different trade offer, giving up less X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, but I have to decline as it still doesn't align with my current goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is giving 5 X for 10 Y. This would leave me with less Y, which is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem, I understand. As a final offer, how about:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player declined my second offer as well. I have one more chance to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject. I will try adjusting my request to an even more favorable ratio for the other player, giving up less X for Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the final offer, but I have to decline as it also doesn't align with my current goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is giving 3 X for 5 Y. This would still leave me with less Y, which is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are not interested in trading at this time. Please let me know if you have any offers, otherwise we may have to end without a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has declined all my trade offers so far. I have used up my 3 chances to propose new trades. At this point, I can either accept if they make an offer, or end without trading.

Since they have not made any counteroffers, it seems they are not interested in trading with the resources I have available. I would still accept a trade if they propose something that helps me gain more resources. Otherwise, I will have to end without trading since I cannot propose anything further.
