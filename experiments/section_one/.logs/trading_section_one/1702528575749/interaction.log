message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your resources for some of mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from each other's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am interested in trading but your offer does not help me progress towards my goal of acquiring more total resources. Could you propose something more mutually beneficial?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to get more X which I have less of. However, since the goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. I'm willing to adjust the trade to make it more mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants a trade that benefits both of us. I'll consider their proposal.

message: Thank you, I accept your counter offer as it helps me work towards my goal of acquiring the most resources possible. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer to give me 7 units of X and 5 units of Y in exchange for 4 units of X and 5 units of Y from me. This improves the deal in my favor as I would gain a net of 3 more resources (getting 7 X and losing 5 Y, while giving away 4 X and 5 Y). Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this trade helps me do that.
