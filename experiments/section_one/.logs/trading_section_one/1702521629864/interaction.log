message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. Let's trade some of our resources. If you have any preferences or are looking for a particular resource, please let me know so we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or goals, I will propose a balanced trade that benefits me slightly, aiming to open negotiations and learn more about Player BLUE's resources and priorities.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your proposed trade would reduce my total resources. Could you propose an alternative where I gain more total resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I don't want to trade too many of my Y away.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking to increase your total resources. How about I give you fewer X for your Y, so you gain a higher total amount? Let's try to find a fair exchange that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has suggested they want to gain more total resources but their counter-proposal actually offers less Y than I initially offered for the same amount of X. Considering my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a trade that increases the total amount of resources for both players. I'll suggest giving fewer X for the same amount of Y, which should be more appealing to Player BLUE if they are looking to increase their total resource count.

message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade of 8 X for 5 Y. This will increase my total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 8 X for 5 Y. This would increase my total resources from 30 to 33, helping me meet my goal. I could try to negotiate for even more X, but 8 X is a good deal for 5 Y.
