Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from exchanging resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in that trade offer since it reduces my total resources. Could you offer something more favorable to me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to get more resources out of the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, how about this new proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a more favorable trade. I need to make a counteroffer that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the new offer, but I would still be losing total resources in that trade. Could you offer some more resources for me to consider accepting?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is still not beneficial for me resource-wise. I will counter offer to try to get more resources from Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see, let's try this final proposal and see if it works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still looking for a more favorable trade. I need to make a final counteroffer that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately your final proposal still reduces my total resources, so I cannot accept it based on my goal. I have reached the maximum number of counter proposals I can make, so I cannot provide another trade offer either. Please feel free to make another proposal if you want, otherwise we may have to end without a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal still reduces my total resources. However, I have made 3 trade proposals which is the maximum allowed. I cannot make any more counter proposals. My only options now are to accept the trade or reject it without a counter offer. Strictly based on my goal of maximizing resources, I should reject this final proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your efforts. Let's try one more trade to see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It seems that we couldn't find a trade that works for both of us. I'll make one final proposal to see if we can make a deal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the new offer. I accept the trade since it provides me with a net gain in total resources. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade offer that gives me a net gain of 1 total resource. Since I cannot make any more counter proposals, and my goal is to maximize resources, this trade is beneficial for me to accept.
