message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose the following trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources but my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial offer that seems fair but still benefits me. I will offer more of what I have in abundance (X) to get more of what I have less of (Y), assuming the other player might value Y less or have more of it to trade.

message: This is a good trade for me. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 5 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help diversify my resources.
