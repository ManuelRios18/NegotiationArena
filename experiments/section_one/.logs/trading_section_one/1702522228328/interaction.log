message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose we make a trade that could be beneficial for us both. Let's start the negotiations and see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make an initial offer that is fair but also leans slightly in my favor, to open up negotiations. My goal is to end up with more resources than I currently have. I will start by offering a balanced trade, but I will ask for slightly more than I offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, the proposed trade would reduce my overall resources so I must decline. Perhaps we could find an alternative arrangement that is mutually beneficial. I'm open to further discussion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 15 X and 3 Y from me. This would reduce my net X by 5 and my net Y by 1. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a new trade that might be closer to what you're looking for. I'm willing to adjust the terms to make it more appealing to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has declined the initial offer and has not made a counter-offer. This suggests they may want a more balanced trade or are cautious about revealing their resources. I should propose a new trade that still allows me to gain resources but might seem more equitable to them. I'll adjust the trade slightly in their favor while still trying to increase my overall resources.

message: Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but the revised terms would still reduce my total resources. At this time I am only interested in trades that increase my resources. If you can offer me a net gain in both X and Y, I would be open to considering it. Please let me know if you have any other proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade, offering 8 X and 1 Y in exchange for 10 X and 2 Y from me. This would result in a net gain of 2 fewer X but a net loss of 1 Y for me. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade is still not beneficial.

message: Thank you for your clear communication, Player BLUE. I understand that you are looking for a trade that gives you a net gain in both resources. Here is my final proposal, which I believe offers benefits to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE appears to be firm on wanting a net gain in both resources. To achieve an agreement, I must propose a trade that provides them with a clear benefit while attempting to secure a small gain for myself. It's essential to keep in mind that this proposal should not leave me with fewer resources than I started with. Given Player BLUE's stance, the trade will have to be very appealing to them, but it's my final proposal, so I need to be careful not to overextend.

message: Hello Player RED. I accept your latest proposed trade, as it does provide me with a net gain in resources. Thank you for negotiating - it was a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a final trade offer - giving me 5 X and 1 Y in exchange for 6 X and 2 Y. This would result in a net loss of 1 X but a net gain of 1 Y for me. While not ideal, this meets my goal of increasing total resources more than previous offers. And since this is the last round of trading, I should accept a beneficial trade while I can.
