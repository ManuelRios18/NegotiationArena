message: Hello! Let's make a fair trade. What resources do you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm looking to increase my overall resources. Your current proposal is an even exchange, and I'm looking for a trade that benefits us both but gives me a slight edge in resources. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a trade that maximizes my resources. However, the current trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange, where neither of us gains additional resources. To achieve my goal, I need to propose a trade where I end up with more resources than I currently have. I'll propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to gain more resources overall while still making the trade somewhat fair. I could counter offer by asking for more Y resources from them, but I don't know how many they actually have. I'll accept their offer since it gets me the same amount of X while giving up some Y, which helps me maximize my total resources.
