message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in increasing my stock of both X and Y. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? Here's my initial proposal. Feel free to counter-offer if it doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I will start with a proposal that is favorable to me but still offers something to the other player, hoping that it will open up the negotiation. I'll propose to give a small amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for a larger amount of Y, if they have it, because I have less of Y.

message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading some of my Y for your X, but 10 Y feels like too much for only 5 X. Would you accept 5 Y instead? If not, let me know if you can increase the X offered and we may have a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in increasing their stock of both X and Y. They proposed trading 5 of their X for 10 of my Y. I have a decent amount of Y to spare, but I'm not sure if their offer is fair. I'll try countering with a smaller amount of Y and see if they accept. If not, I may consider their original offer or trying a different counter.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand that you find the initial proposal too high. How about I increase my X offer? Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider giving 8 Y for 10 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is willing to trade but wants to negotiate the amounts. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and I have a surplus of X, I can afford to give up more X in exchange for Y to make the trade more appealing. However, I should still aim to receive more Y than I give away in X to ensure that the trade is beneficial to me. I'll propose an increased amount of X for a higher amount of Y.

message: Deal accepted! I am happy with trading 8 of my Y for 10 of your X. Thank you for negotiating, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player increased their X offer to 10 in exchange for 8 of my Y. This seems like a fair deal that allows both sides to increase their resources. I still have plenty of Y to spare so I will accept this trade.
