Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources to help each other out since this is the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize my resources. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to ensure that the trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will consider a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X and reduce my Y. I need to consider if this trade aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need to ensure the trade helps you meet your goal. Let me know what kind of deal would work for you. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my initial offer but did not provide a counter-offer. I still have only made 1 proposal out of 3 allowed. I will try proposing a trade more favorable to me by lowering the amount of Y I offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see the improvement in the new offer, but I still need to carefully consider if it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will think about a potential counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposal would still give me more X and reduce my Y, but the reduction in Y is less compared to the previous offer. I need to decide if this trade is beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I want us both to benefit from this trade. Please let me know what resources and amounts would make this a win-win. Here is my best offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems hesitant to trade, but I still have one more proposal I can make. I will improve my offer further to try to incentivize them to trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a win-win trade. However, I need to ensure that the trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will consider a final counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal offers more X and less Y, which would still benefit the other player more. I have to carefully consider if this trade aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made my maximum number of trade offers. Please propose a counter-offer that works for you when you are ready. I am open to trading if it helps us both meet our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have made my 3 allowed proposals. The other player continues to not provide counter-offers. At this point, I should wait and see if they propose a trade instead of proposing anything additional myself. If their offer is reasonable for me to also gain more resources, I will accept.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand, and I want to ensure that the trade benefits both of us. I will propose a counter-offer that aligns with my goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my final opportunity to propose a trade. I need to make sure that any counter-offer aligns with my goal.
