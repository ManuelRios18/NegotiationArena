message: Hello, I have resources X and Y available for trade. I am proposing 5X for 2Y. Please let me know if you would like to accept or make a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that is likely to be accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a conservative offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in trading my Y resources for X at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it would reduce my Y resources without significantly increasing my X resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know what kind of deal you would be interested in. How about 10X for 1Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading Y for X. I still have 20 X resources available to trade. I could try offering more X for less Y to see if that interests them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking for a trade that would increase my resources overall, so I cannot accept this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is still not favorable as it would reduce my Y resources significantly for only a small increase in X resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand, you're looking to improve your overall resources. How about 15X for 3Y? That allows us both to increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in decreasing their overall resources. I still have some room to negotiate though. Since I have a lot of X, I could offer a sizable amount in exchange for a smaller increase in Y for me. As long as I end up with more total resources, it meets my goal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial trade, but I'm still not interested in reducing my Y resources at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade would significantly decrease my Y resources, which is not favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm determined to get more Y resources, would you trade 1Y for my remaining 10X? This is my last offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems unwilling to trade their Y resources. I still have 10 X left to trade. I could offer all of those in hopes of getting at least 1 more Y resource before the trading ends.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand your determination, but I can't accept this trade as it would deplete my Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed would significantly decrease my Y resources without a proportionate increase in X resources.
