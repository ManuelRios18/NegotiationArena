message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to start things off. Looking forward to a fair trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't have any information about Player BLUE's resources and goals, my initial trade proposal should be general and aim to increase my overall resources. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but would like a deal that is more favorable for me in terms of total resources gained. Please make another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to get more resources out of the trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade that is more balanced in terms of resource distribution. Here's my revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it stands because it would leave me with fewer overall resources. I'll adjust the proposal to ensure that I still end up with a net gain in resources. I have to keep in mind that this is my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer Player RED. I would still like to try to maximize my resource gains since this is the final round. Could you offer a bit more in exchange for what I have?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is more favorable for me resource-wise. I gain a net of 4 more resources. However, I think I can still negotiate for an even better deal since this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your desire to maximize gains. Here's my final proposal, which I believe is fair to both of us. Let's make a trade that benefits us both for this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is again not favorable for me as it would give me a net loss in the more abundant resource, X, while only a slight gain in Y. However, I need to make a final offer that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider, without compromising my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This will be my third and final proposal, so I must be strategic about it.

message: Player RED, I accept your latest proposed trade. Thank you for the negotiations, it was a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, I gain a net total of 10 resources (14X + 3Y - 7X - 7Y) compared to my current 5X + 25Y resources. This seems like a good final deal that benefits both me and Player RED. Since it's the last round, I will accept.
