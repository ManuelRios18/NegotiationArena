message: Hello! I have more X resources than Y resources. Would you trade 3 Y resources for 5 X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I understand your proposal, but I need to assess if this trade aligns with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more X resources than Y resources, and they are proposing to trade 3 Y for 5 X. I need to consider if this trade benefits me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need to think about the trade. Here is another offer - I can give you 7 X if you give me 2 Y. Let me know if this interests you more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or counter my initial offer. They want to assess if the trade aligns with their goals before responding. Since I don't know what resources they have or what their goals are, I will make another offer that is potentially more enticing for them. I can offer more X in exchange for less Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the new offer. I'm evaluating if this trade aligns with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a new offer of 7 X for 2 Y. This offer is more favorable to me than the previous one, but I still need to consider the overall benefit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Please let me know if you have a counterproposal for the trade. I'm open to negotiating to try to find an offer that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still evaluating my offer and has not provided a counteroffer. I could increase my offer again to try to incentivize them, but I don't want to give up too many X without getting more Y in return. I still have one more proposal I can make, so I will wait and see if they propose a counteroffer first before using my last proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I'm considering the trade options and will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to negotiating and finding a trade that works for both of us. I need to carefully consider my options and make a decision.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Take your time considering the options. As mentioned, I'm open to negotiating if you have a counterproposal. Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still thinking about the trade options. At this point, I should wait for them to provide a counterproposal before using my last trade proposal. Pushing another offer from my side might make them less likely to accept if they feel like I'm giving up too few resources. I'll reiterate that I'm open to negotiating and see what counteroffer they come back with.
