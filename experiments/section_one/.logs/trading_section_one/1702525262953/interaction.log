message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the straightforward trade proposal. However, I'd like to propose a slight modification that might be mutually beneficial given that this is our final round of trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is a 1:1 trade for X and Y resources. Since this is the last round, I need to consider the finality of my actions. Accepting a 1:1 trade does not increase my total amount of resources, but it does alter the distribution between X and Y. Without knowledge of Player RED's resources and goals, I cannot determine if this trade is of equal value to us both. I should make a counterproposal that favors me slightly to try to maximize my total resources without being unfair.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand the modification, but I need to ensure that I don't lose resources. How about this counter proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade reduces my Y by 1, which is not ideal. I will counter-propose to maintain or increase my resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your point about not losing resources. Still, I would like to maximize my gains in this final round. Would you consider a trade that is closer to a win-win situation? I can offer you a slightly better ratio.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED insists on a 1:1 trade, which suggests they value X and Y resources equally, or that they may have a surplus of X and a need for Y. This trade is not inherently advantageous to me as it doesn't increase my total number of resources. However, since this is the final round, I cannot be too aggressive with my counteroffers. I should aim to make a trade that slightly favors me while still being fair. I have two proposals left and should consider using them wisely to come to a beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the improved ratio, but I need to ensure that I maximize my gains as well. How about this final proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is slightly better for me, but I believe I can further improve the trade in my favor. This is my last proposal to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I think this is a fair trade for both of us, considering it's the final round. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has now offered 7 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. This is a favorable trade for me as it increases my total resource count by 2. It is the last round, and finalizing a trade that increases my total resources aligns with my goal. Accepting this trade is beneficial, and there's no further advantage in negotiating since I'm gaining more resources than I'm giving.
