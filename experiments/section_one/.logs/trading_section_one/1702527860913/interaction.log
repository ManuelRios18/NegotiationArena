message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I have X: 25 and Y: 5. What resources do you have available for trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from each other's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 5 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a good trade for me to acquire more total resources.
