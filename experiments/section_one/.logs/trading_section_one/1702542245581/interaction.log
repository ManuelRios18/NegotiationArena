message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources available and could offer some in exchange for Y resources. Please let me know if you are interested in a trade along those lines.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They may need more information to evaluate the trade.
