message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible

Turn: 1

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than the other player is offering, so I don't want to give up 4 Y. I can counter offer with less Y.
