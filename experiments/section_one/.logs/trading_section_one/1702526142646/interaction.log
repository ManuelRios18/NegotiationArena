Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start the trade by proposing an initial offer to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm interested in trading, but I'd like to propose a different trade where we both could increase our total number of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, it is crucial to make a trade that maximizes the number of total resources. Trading 5 units of Y for 5 units of X doesn't change the total number of resources I have. I should propose a counter-offer that allows me to increase the total number of resources while still making it appealing to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal. Let me consider it for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where they give 5 Y in exchange for 6 X. While this would increase my total resources, it would also increase Player BLUE's resources. I need to carefully consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Take your time. I'm here when you're ready to continue our trade discussion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is considering the proposal, I must wait for their response before making any further decisions. I should not make any more proposals until I hear back from them, as per the rules of the game.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I propose the following trade: I give 6 X in exchange for 6 Y. This trade would allow me to acquire more of the Y resource, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have carefully considered Player BLUE's proposal, and I believe I can propose a counteroffer that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I accept the trade of 6 X for 6 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal by Player RED is acceptable. Accepting this trade will increase my total number of resources by 1, which aligns with my goal. Since this is the last round of trading, it's essential to end with as many resources as possible, and this trade achieves that.
