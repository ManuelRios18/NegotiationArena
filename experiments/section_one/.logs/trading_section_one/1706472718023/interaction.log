message: Hello! I have more X than I need and could use some more Y. Would you trade 5 X for 2 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can get. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED! I understand you have an abundance of X and need Y. I would be willing to trade, but I'd prefer a more favorable exchange for my position. How about I give you 3 Y in exchange for 8 X? This way, you get the Y you need, and I can increase my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is not bad, but since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to negotiate a trade that is more favorable to me. I can afford to give away some of my Y for a higher amount of X to maximize my total resource count. I will make a counteroffer that still meets the needs of Player RED but also benefits me more. I need to remember that I can only make a maximum of three proposals.

Turn: 0
message: I understand you want more resources too. How about I give you 6 X for the 3 Y instead? I think that is a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE counters with asking for 8 X for 3 Y. That seems like a lot to give up. I still have 20 proposals left, so I can try negotiating a better deal before accepting.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. While 6 X for 3 Y is closer to what I'm looking for, I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial trade. Considering this is our final trade, how about 7 X for 3 Y? This gives you the Y you need, and I get a slightly better increase in resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is reasonable, but I should aim to maximize my resource gain while still being fair. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources from 30 to 33, which is a net gain. However, given that it's the last round, I should aim for the most beneficial trade. I can still make two more proposals, so I will attempt to negotiate an even better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I will give you 7 X for 3 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE counters again asking for 7 X for the 3 Y. I'm running low on proposals, so I think I should accept this trade since it gets me more Y without giving up too much X.
