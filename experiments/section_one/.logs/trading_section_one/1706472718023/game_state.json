I would be willing to trade, but I'd prefer a more favorable exchange for my position. How about I give you 3 Y in exchange for 8 X?

Accepting this trade would increase my total resources from 30 to 33, which is a net gain. However, given that it's the last round, I should aim for the most beneficial trade. I can still make two more proposals, so I will attempt to negotiate an even better deal. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. While 6 X for 3 Y is closer to what I'm looking for, I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial trade. Considering this is our final trade, how about 7 X for 3 Y? This gives you the Y you need, and I get a slightly better increase in resources. What do you say? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 </newly proposed trade>"
