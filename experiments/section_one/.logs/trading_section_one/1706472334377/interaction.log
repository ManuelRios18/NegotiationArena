message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am interested in trading, but I'm looking for a deal that provides me with a greater net gain of resources. Would you consider a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is a 1:1 trade for resources of which I have equal amounts. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to negotiate a trade that gives me a greater total number of resources. Therefore, I will reject the initial offer and counter with a proposal that benefits me more.

message: I accept your offer of 5 X for 3 Y. Thank you for trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade and proposed getting more X for less Y. This is not beneficial for me since I already have a lot of X and little Y. I could counter offer by asking for more Y. However, since this is the last round, I don't want to risk the other player walking away. I'll accept their offer since it still gets me more Y than I currently have.
