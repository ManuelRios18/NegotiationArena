Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a balanced trade to get things started. Looking forward to a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will offer a balanced trade to initiate negotiations. My goal is to acquire more resources, but without knowing what the other player values, I need to start with a fair offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade is not balanced in my favor. I need to prioritize acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as I would be giving up 3 units of Y for only 2 units of X. I need to prioritize acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to prioritize acquiring more resources. Let's try another trade that might be more appealing to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has indicated that the initial trade was not in their favor and they're looking to maximize their resources. Since they did not propose a counter-offer, I still don't have information about their resource pool. I need to propose a trade that seems more favorable to them while still attempting to increase my own resources. I'll adjust the trade slightly to give them more of resource Y, which I have less of, making it more valuable to me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The trade is getting closer to being favorable, but I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The newly proposed trade is more favorable as I would be gaining 2 units of X and only giving up 1 unit of Y. However, I can still try to negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. Let's explore a deal that might be more beneficial for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 14, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not satisfied but is indicating that we are moving in the right direction. They have yet to propose a counter-offer, which means I am still in the dark about their resources but suggests they might be looking for an offer that gives them a clear advantage. Given this is my second-to-last proposal, I'll adjust the trade to be slightly more in their favor to entice an acceptance without sacrificing too much of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: The trade is more beneficial for me, and I am willing to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The newly proposed trade is tempting as I would be gaining 4 units of X and only giving up 1 unit of Y. This trade is more favorable, and I should consider accepting it.
