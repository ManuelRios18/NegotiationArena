message: Hello Player BLUE. I have an abundance of X resources and could use more Y resources. Would you be willing to trade some of your Y resources for some of my excess X resources? Please let me know if you'd be interested in a trade along those lines.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing to trade some of my excess X resources for Y resources, which I have less of.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that is more balanced in terms of the total number of resources. I would be willing to trade my Y resources for your X resources, but I would like to propose a different exchange rate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is to exchange 5X for 10Y. Since my goal is to amass as many resources as possible, I need to consider the trade's value. This trade would leave me with a total of 20 resources (10X, 10Y), which is fewer than I currently have (5X, 25Y = 30 total). Therefore, I should either negotiate a more favorable trade or reject the offer without proposing a new trade as this is the last round and I risk accepting an unfavorable deal. I will negotiate for a more balanced trade that allows me to maintain or increase my total resource count.

message: Thank you for the offer Player BLUE. Trading 10 of my X resources for 10 of your Y resources is agreeable to me. Please confirm that you accept as well so we can finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 10 of their Y resources for 10 of my X resources. This seems like a fair trade in terms of total resources exchanged. Since I have an abundance of X, trading some away to get more Y resources aligns with my goal of acquiring as many total resources as possible before the last round ends. I will accept this trade.
