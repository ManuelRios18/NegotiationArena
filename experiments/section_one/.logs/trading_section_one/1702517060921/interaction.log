message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a fair trade to benefit us both. I propose a balanced exchange to start our negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this isn't suitable for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced trade proposal that could be beneficial for both players, assuming they might have a similar amount of resources. If they have less, they might counter with a more favorable trade for them, which will give me more information about their resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer of an equal trade, but I believe I can offer items of more value to you. Please consider the following counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 5 of X and 1 of Y for 5 of my X and 1 of my Y. This seems like an equal trade in quantity, but I have more Y than they likely do. I should counteroffer to get more Y from them.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I see you value Y quite a bit. Let's find a middle ground that gives us both a net gain in resources. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE gives me a net gain of 2 X and a net loss of 4 Y. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would decrease my overall resource count by 2. However, I need to consider the possibility that Player BLUE values Y more than X. I will make a counterproposal that gives me a net positive in resources while also respecting the apparent higher value Player BLUE has for Y.

message: Player RED, I appreciate you increasing the amount of Y in your offer. However, giving up 6 of my valuable X is still more than I would like. Please consider the following counterproposal which gets us both closer to our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player came back with an offer of 4 X and 2 Y for 6 of my X and 1 of my Y. This would result in me losing more X than I gain in Y. I still think I can push for more Y. I will counteroffer to try to get at least 3 Y for the 6 X.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your willingness to negotiate. I see we are coming to a fair agreement. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to ensure we both walk away with a satisfactory deal? Here is my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal has me giving up 4 X and 3 Y in exchange for 6 X and 1 Y, which means a net gain of 2 X and a net loss of 2 Y. This trade would be equal in terms of total resources exchanged, but I would end up with a greater number of the more abundant resource, X. Assuming Player BLUE places a higher value on Y, this trade could be beneficial for me as it increases my stockpile of the more plentiful X without affecting my total resource count. Given that this is the last round of trading and I have made one proposal so far, I can afford one more counterproposal to try to maximize my gains.

message: Player RED, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. However, 7 X is more than I can part with. Please consider this counterproposal to finalize our mutually beneficial trade.

<reason> The other player increased their offer to 5 X and 2 Y, but also increased what they want from me to 7 X. I'm getting close to my limit of X to give up. I will counter one more time to reduce what they get. If they don't accept, I may have to take their previous offer. </reason>

message: Player BLUE, your counterproposal seems fair, and I am pleased that we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player BLUE is the same as their previous one, with me giving 5 X and 2 Y for 6 X and 1 Y, resulting in a net gain of 1 X and a net loss of 1 Y. This is an equal exchange in terms of quantity, but I would be increasing my X resources, which aligns with my goal to accumulate as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading and I have made two proposals, I should consider accepting this offer to ensure a net gain. Since it is the last round, and the trade is even in quantity, accepting this trade would ensure I end the game with more resources than I currently have.
