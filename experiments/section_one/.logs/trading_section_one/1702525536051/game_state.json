Given that there is no specific value attached to either resource, the trade appears to be even. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to get more in return than I give away. The current offer doesn't achieve that, and I have no information on Player RED's resources to know if they can afford a better offer. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> While I appreciate your offer, I'm looking for a trade that would give me a net gain in resources.

This is a balanced trade in terms of quantity, but it does not help me achieve my goal of maximizing resources since there is no net gain. I have already made two proposals, so I have one last chance to propose a trade that gives me a net gain. I need to ensure that the trade I propose now is favorable to me since this is the last round and my last proposal opportunity. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your offer.
