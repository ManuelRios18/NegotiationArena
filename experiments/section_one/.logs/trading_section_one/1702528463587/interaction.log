message: Hello, would you be interested in a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what the other player is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I am open to trading but your proposed trade does not benefit me much. Let's discuss a better trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than X resources. Trading away some of my Y resources seems reasonable to get more X resources, since more resources in general is better. However, trading away 5 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a good deal for me.

message: I understand your point. How about this trade instead? Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposed trade is not very beneficial for me. I need to propose a better trade.

message: This new trade offer benefits me, so I accept. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade gives me 10 X resources for only 5 Y resources. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a good deal for me to get more total resources.
