message: Hello, let's trade resources to mutually benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be acceptable to them. I'll start by proposing trading 5 X for 3 Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. Let's end the trading here.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should calculate if this trade benefits me in terms of total resources. 

I currently have:
X: 5 
Y: 25
Total resources: 30

If I accept the trade:
X: 10 (gained 5)
Y: 22 (lost 3)  
Total resources: 32

Since the total resources increases from 30 to 32, this trade benefits me.
