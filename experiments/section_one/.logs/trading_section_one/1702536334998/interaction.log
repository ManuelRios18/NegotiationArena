message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but would like more resource X if possible since I have a large amount of resource Y to spare. Please let me know if you can offer more X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I have a lot more Y than Player RED likely has X based on them only offering 5. I should counter offer to try to get more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X. Here is a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to have a lot of Y resources and is asking for more X in exchange. I have enough X to offer more. I'll propose trading 15 of my X for 15 of their Y. That should be an appealing offer for both sides.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing the offer of X. I have a large quantity of Y available to trade. Please let me know if you can offer even more X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 20 | Player RED Gives X: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 15 of resource X. However, I still have more Y to spare than they likely have X. I will counter offer one more time to try to maximize the amount of X I can get.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can increase my offer of X a bit more. Please let me know if this trade works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to have a lot of Y and is asking for even more X. I'm hesitant to trade away too much X since it's my more scarce resource. But getting 20 Y would help me significantly. I'll propose a trade of 18 X for 20 Y. If they reject, I may have to reduce my Y requests.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept the trade of 18 of your resource X for 20 of my resource Y. This will help balance my resource distribution. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their X offer to 18, which is close to the 20 I asked for. I likely cannot get much more X out of them. I will accept this trade since it allows me to acquire more of the resource I have less of.
