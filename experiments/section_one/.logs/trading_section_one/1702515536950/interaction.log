Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to diversify my resources and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start the negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will aim to propose a trade that seems fair but also attempts to slightly favor me. Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll make an initial balanced offer to open the negotiations.
