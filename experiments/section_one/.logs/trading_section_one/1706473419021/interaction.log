message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the fair trade offer. I would like to propose a new trade to see if we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is fair, but I can propose a new trade to try to get more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm afraid I can't accept giving up that much Y. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing that I give up 10 Y resources for 5 X and 5 Y resources. This would reduce my total Y resources, which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible before the last round ends. I will counter propose to try and get more Y resources from them.

message: I understand your concern. I'm willing to adjust the trade to find a better balance. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is hesitant to give up Y, so I may need to reconsider the trade to find a better balance.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you, that trade works for me. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, I would give up 3 X and 5 Y for 10 Y from the other player. This allows me to gain more Y overall while giving up some X, which helps work towards my goal. I think this is a fair trade.
