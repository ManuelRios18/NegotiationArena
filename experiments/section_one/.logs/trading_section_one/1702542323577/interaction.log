message: Hello! I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y. To balance that out, I will propose trading some X for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering the same amount. I prefer to have more of each resource, so I will reject this trade and propose a new one.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately I do not have enough Y resources to give up 8. Let's try a simpler trade - you give me some Y, I'll give you some X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 8 Y resources from me, which is more than I have. I should reject this trade. I still think trading some of my excess X resources for more Y would benefit us both, so I will propose that counteroffer again.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the simplicity of the trade, but I need to maintain a balance of resources. How about we try a trade that allows us to both benefit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a trade for 5 Y in exchange for 5 X. This would leave me with no Y, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will reject this trade and propose a new one.

Turn: 0
message: I apologize, but I cannot accept a trade where I must give up more resources than I have. Let's end negotiations here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed the exact same unbalanced trade again that I already rejected because I don't have 8 Y to give up. I could counter offer again, but it seems they may not be willing to compromise on a fairer trade. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my resources rather than keep negotiating. I will reject their offer and not propose anything new.
