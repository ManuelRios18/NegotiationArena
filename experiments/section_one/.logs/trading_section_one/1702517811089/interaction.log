Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to start our negotiations. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I don't have any information about Player BLUE's resources or goals, I will make a balanced initial offer that would seem fair based on the resources I have. I will ask for a smaller amount of one resource in exchange for a larger amount of the other, hoping that Player BLUE might value one resource over the other and will be willing to trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade proposal. I will consider it and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources while considering the trade offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you need time to consider the proposal. Perhaps you might find this adjusted offer more to your liking. I am willing to negotiate further if you have counter-proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE did not respond with a counter-proposal or acceptance, it's difficult to gauge their interests or resources. As this is the last round and there will be no further trading after this, I must make a decision based on the lack of information. I should either make another balanced proposal that slightly adjusts the previous one in hopes of enticing a response or accept the fact that no trade might occur. I will attempt one more proposal, taking into account that I have two more proposals left after this one.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjusted offer. I will carefully consider it and get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is closer to balance, but I need to ensure it aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm here to work towards a deal that benefits us both. I hope this final proposal meets your approval, and I invite you to make a counter-offer if it does not.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not provided any counter-proposals or specific preferences, making it challenging to reach a beneficial trade. Given that this is the last round of trading and Player BLUE remains non-committal, it may be strategic to make a final proposal that's more conservative, ensuring I don't overextend my resources without knowing their position. I should use my third and final proposal wisely, offering a trade that I would be comfortable with if accepted, as I won't be able to propose again after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the final proposal. I will now evaluate and respond.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final proposal, and it's time to make a decision.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking forward to your decision, Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've made my three proposals, and now I must wait for Player BLUE's response. Since I cannot propose a new trade, my only options are to accept a trade if offered or to end the game without a trade if Player BLUE does not provide an acceptable offer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I accept the final proposal. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It's time to make a decision based on my goal of acquiring more resources.
