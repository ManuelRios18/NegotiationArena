message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a fair trade to maximize our resources. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I should aim to propose a balanced trade that would be tempting for the other player while also increasing my overall resources. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I have to make an educated guess and offer a fair trade. It's also important to keep in mind that I can only make three proposals, so each one should count.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but I am going to have to decline for now. Let's keep negotiating to find a fair trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 3 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 24 Y total, while Player RED would end up with 18 X and 0 Y.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me. I should try to get more Y from Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I think we can come closer to an agreement that benefits us both. Here is my revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources (I would be giving up more than I receive). I need to counter with a proposal that leans more towards my advantage while still appearing fair. Since Player BLUE is offering less of resource X than I proposed to give, they might value resource X more or have less of it. I'll adjust the amounts slightly in my favor while still offering a decent amount of resource Y.

message: Thank you for revising your offer, Player RED. I accept your proposed trade of you giving me 7 X and 3 Y in exchange for 6 X and 4 Y from me. This will allow us both to increase our resources. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In Player RED's revised offer, they are proposing to give me 7 X and 3 Y in exchange for 6 X and 4 Y from me. This would result in me having 6 X and 24 Y total, while Player RED would have 16 X and 0 Y.

This offer is better for me than the previous one. I would be losing 1 less X and gaining 1 more Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I think this is a good deal to accept.
