message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I'd like to propose a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I will have to decline your offer for now. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1 | Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X and 2 Y in exchange for 4 X and 3 Y from me. This means I would gain 1 more X but lose 1 more Y. Since I have more Y than X, I think losing 1 Y is better than gaining 1 X.

message: I understand. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has declined my initial offer. I need to counter with a new proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with the same deal I proposed. This trade will net me an extra 1 X for the same amount of Y, which is better for me since I have less X. I will accept this trade.
