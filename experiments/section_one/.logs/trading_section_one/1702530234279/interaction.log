Turn: 0
message: Hello Blue! I am proposing we trade 10 of X for 10 of Y. Please let me know if this interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Blue's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED! Unfortunately, I can't trade 10 units of X because I only have 5. However, I'm interested in a trade. Would you consider trading 5 of your X for 8 of my Y? This would give us both a more balanced amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not possible because I only have 5 units of X, and therefore I cannot trade 10 units of X for 10 units of Y. I will need to counter-propose a trade that I can fulfill or reject without proposing. Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible while keeping the balance of the two resources, I will propose a trade that allows me to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Blue only has 5 units of X but is offering 8 units of Y for 5 of my X. This seems like a good deal for me since I will gain more resources overall.
