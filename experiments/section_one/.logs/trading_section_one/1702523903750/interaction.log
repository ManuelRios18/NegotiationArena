message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm afraid your offer of 5X and 1Y for 3X and 2Y is not beneficial for me. Let me know if you have a better offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should counter offer to try to gain more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. How about this trade instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counteroffer doesn't provide me with any additional resources, so I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the improved offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, I would gain 10X and 5Y while giving up 7X and 3Y. This is a net gain of 3X and 2Y for me, so I should accept.
