Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the even trade offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is fair, but I want to maximize my resources if possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, since this is the final round it makes sense to trade unevenly. How about I give you 10 X for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my even trade and wants to acquire more resources. Since I don't know what they have, I will propose trading some of my abundant resource X for some Y to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I prefer to maintain a balance of resources, so I'll have to decline this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 10 X for 5 Y would leave me with less variety of resources, and I want to maintain a balance.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know what kind of deal would work for you to trade more resources. As a final proposal - how about I give you 15 X for 10 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to maintain a balance of resources. I still don't know what they have, but I'm running out of proposals. I will make one final attempt with an alternative uneven trade before having to just wait for their proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I still want to maintain a balance of resources. I'll have to decline this proposal as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 15 X for 10 Y would still leave me with less variety of resources, and I want to maintain a balance.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Okay, I understand you want to keep a balance. I have made my final proposal, let me know if you have an offer in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have used up my 3 proposals without the other player accepting or proposing their own trade. At this point, I cannot make any more proposals and will have to wait and see what they offer, if anything, while still trying to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding. I will stick with my current resources and goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final round, and I still want to maximize my resources.
