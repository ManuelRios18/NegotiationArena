message: Hello, I am proposing an even trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an even trade to test what resources they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am willing to trade more of my abundant resource Y for your resource X. Please let me know if you are interested in a 10Y for 7X trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 5 for 5 trade of X and Y. However, I have more Y than X, so I would prefer to trade more of my Y for their X. I will counter offer to trade 10 of my Y for 7 of their X.

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 Y for 7 X. Since I have more X, trading some of it for more Y would diversify my resources. I should accept this trade.
