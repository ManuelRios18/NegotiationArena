message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in trading but would like to propose a different exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I do not have any information about Player RED's resources, I should aim to maximize my own resources. The current trade offer is an even exchange, but to maximize my resources, I need to acquire more than I give away. I should propose a trade where I give away fewer Y resources than the X resources I am receiving.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I would prefer getting a bit more Y for the X I offer. Could you do 4 Y instead of 3?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving me 3 Y for 5 X. Since I have a lot more X, getting some additional Y would still benefit me. However, I was hoping to get more Y for my X. I could counter offer asking for 4 Y instead of 3.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair trade. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is reasonable, as it still ensures I gain more resources than I part with. Since the goal is to maximize resources and this trade would result in a net gain of one resource, it aligns with my objective. Accepting this trade would mean I end up with 10X and 21Y, which is a larger total than my current holdings.
