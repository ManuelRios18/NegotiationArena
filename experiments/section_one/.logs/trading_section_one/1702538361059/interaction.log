message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Greetings, Player RED. Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in trading, but I would like to propose a slightly different trade that I believe could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer on the table is an even trade, five of my Y for five of their X. Since I have more Y than X, it would be beneficial for me to balance my resources, especially if X is of equal or greater value than Y. However, since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize gains. I'll propose a counter-offer that still benefits me more than the current offer.

message: I would prefer to trade 5 X for 5 Y. Does that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed that I give 7 X for 5 Y. This is not as good of a deal for me, since I would be giving up more resources than them. However, I still need more Y. I could counter offer by reducing the amount of X I give.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consistency, Player RED. However, I'm looking for a trade that's more advantageous for me since this is the final round. How about we try this offer instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED insists on the original offer. Since this is the last round, it's essential to make the trade beneficial because there won't be another opportunity to negotiate. I need to use my second proposal to try to get a better deal without making it unattractive for Player RED.

message: Deal accepted. I look forward to future trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player came down to 6 X for 5 Y. I still have a lot more X than I need, so trading some away to get more Y could be beneficial. I'll accept this trade since it meets my goal of acquiring more resources overall.
