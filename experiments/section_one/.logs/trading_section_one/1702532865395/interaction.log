message: Hello! I have more X than Y. Would you trade 2 Y for 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 2 X for 5 Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered is not favorable for me as I have more Y than X. I should propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 5 Y for only 2 X. This seems like a very good deal for me since I have much more X than Y. I should accept this trade.
