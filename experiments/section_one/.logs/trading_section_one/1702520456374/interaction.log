message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a balanced trade to get us started. Let me know what you think or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or goals, I want to open with a fair trade that might appeal to the other player while giving me a chance to gain resources. I'll start by offering a balanced trade, which they might accept or counter, giving me more insight into their situation.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your balanced offer, but I am hoping to acquire some more Y resources if possible since I am lower on those. Do you have any Y to spare?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is balanced in total resources, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will try to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for Y resources, Player BLUE. However, I would like to keep some Y for myself as well. Here's a counteroffer that might work for both of us. I can give you a higher amount of Y than I get in X, reflecting the value you place on Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in acquiring more Y resources, which I have in limited quantity. The proposed trade asks for all my Y resources in exchange for X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and they're offering a 2:1 trade in terms of X for Y, it's not a favorable trade for me. I want to propose a counteroffer that still gives them Y resources but allows me to maintain a supply of both X and Y, and hopefully gain more X in return. I have to consider that I can only make three proposals, so I want to make each one count.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I will accept trading 8 of my X resources for 5 of your X and 3 of your Y. This allows us both to gain resources we need. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer gives me more Y resources while taking less X from me. This helps me work towards my goal of acquiring more resources overall.
