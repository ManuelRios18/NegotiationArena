message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to maximize my resources. I propose a fair trade to benefit us both, but I'm open to counter-offers. Let's make this final round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it would be beneficial to propose a trade that is favorable but also plausible for the other player to consider. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, it's a bit of a shot in the dark, but starting with a balanced trade could open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. I am also looking to maximize my resources in this final round. Your offer of 5 X for 10 Y does not align with my goal, as I would be giving up more than I gain. I propose a counter-offer below that allows us both to increase our resources. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to minimize what I give up while maximizing what I gain.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. However, I find that giving up twice as much of resource X for Y is not in line with my objectives. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer proposed by Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it involves giving up twice as much of resource X as I would gain in resource Y. It's important to negotiate a trade that is more balanced. I should propose a trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio, which might be more enticing and fair to both parties. Since this is the final round, it's crucial to make a trade that leans towards my advantage without being too unreasonable.

message: I agree, your new proposal of 7 X for 7 Y is mutually beneficial.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an equal trade of 7 units of X for 7 units of my Y. This allows us both to increase our resources while giving up an equal amount. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a fair trade.
