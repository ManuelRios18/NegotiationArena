message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade, and I'm open to counteroffers if this doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that is beneficial but also fair to encourage the other player to accept. I don't have information about Player BLUE's resources, so I will start with a balanced trade proposal.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading for more X, but your offer would leave me with less total resources. Could you offer 12 X for 8 Y instead? I think that allows us both to gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 X and 25 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I accept your trade of 12 X for 8 Y, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer suggests they value X more than Y, which could mean they have a surplus of Y or a need for X. Their offer is for me to give more X than I initially proposed and receive less Y in return. This trade would leave me with a net gain of 4 resources (8Y - 4X, considering X and Y equal for this purpose), which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this offer seems like a good move since it's the last round and it would increase my total resource count.
