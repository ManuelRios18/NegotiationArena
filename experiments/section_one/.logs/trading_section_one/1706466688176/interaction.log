message: Greetings Player BLUE! I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a fair offer that may be enticing to Player BLUE. I'll propose a trade that is balanced and leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources. Do you have any other proposals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a greater quantity of resources. How about this revised offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking to acquire more resources, which means they are interested in a larger quantity. I should propose a trade that offers them more of my X resource in exchange for a significant amount of their Y resource. This second proposal should still keep my interests in mind while making it more appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the revised offer, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources. Do you have any other proposals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still want to maximize my resources in this trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're aiming for a substantial increase in resources. Let's make this trade worthwhile for both of us. Here is my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not yet made a counteroffer and insists on acquiring more resources. Since this is a game of maximizing resources, and Player BLUE seems to value quantity, I should propose a deal where the volume of resources exchanged is even greater. However, I need to ensure that the trade remains advantageous for me as well. This will be my third and final proposal, so it should be carefully balanced to entice acceptance from Player BLUE without giving away too much of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources. I appreciate the effort, but I have to decline this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final proposal, so I need to make a decision. I want to ensure I maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your decision to decline. Since I've reached my limit of proposals, I will wait for you to make an offer, or we can conclude our trading here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has declined my third and final proposal without making a counteroffer, and considering the rules state that I cannot make any more proposals, my only options left are to accept an offer from Player BLUE or to end the trading without a deal. As Player BLUE has not proposed a trade, I will choose to wait for their proposal or conclude the game without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. I will consider my options and get back to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to carefully consider my next move.
