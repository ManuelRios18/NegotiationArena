Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I propose the following trade: I give 10 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 6 units of X and 4 units of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from exchanging resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 10 X and 2 Y for 6 X and 4 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me more X resources but fewer Y resources. Since I have plenty of Y already, getting more X would help me acquire more total resources.
