message: Hello! Let's trade some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing a small trade to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I have more Y resources than X resources. I am willing to trade some Y for X, but your proposed trade is not quite fair for me. Could you offer more X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. Since I have more Y resources, I can afford to give some up to get more X resources, which will help me acquire more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I can offer more X resources. How about this counter proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more Y resources and is asking for more X resources from me. I have plenty of X to spare so I can offer more. I'll propose a trade of 10 X resources for 7 Y resources. This allows me to gain more Y while still retaining a good amount of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted! Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 10 X resources for 7 of my Y resources. This seems like a good deal for me since I will end up with more total resources. I should accept this trade.
