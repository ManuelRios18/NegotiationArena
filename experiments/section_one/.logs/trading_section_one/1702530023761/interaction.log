message: Hello! I have some extra X I could trade for Y. Would you be interested?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! I accept your trade of 5X for 3Y. Looking forward to more such mutually beneficial exchanges in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I have to be strategic. The other player offers 5 units of X for 3 units of Y. I have a surplus of Y, so this trade is beneficial as it increases my overall resources. However, I could attempt to negotiate a better ratio. Given that it's the last round, I might not want to risk losing a trade altogether, so I will accept this offer to ensure I increase my total resource count.
