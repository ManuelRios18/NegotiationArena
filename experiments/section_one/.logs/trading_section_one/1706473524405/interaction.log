Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade of 5X for 5Y to start. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources. I would like to propose a trade of 8Y for 5X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with the same amount of X and less Y, which does not align with my goal of acquiring more resources. I will propose a counter offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are looking for more Y resources. However, I cannot trade 8Y. Let's try for a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for more Y resources and is willing to give up some X. This implies they likely have more X than Y. I should try to get as much Y as I can while giving up the least amount of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective. In that case, I propose a trade of 6Y for 3X. This should help balance the trade more fairly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade would leave me with less Y and only a small increase in X, which does not align with my goal. I will propose a new counter offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come down to 6Y for 3X. I'm still getting more Y which is valuable to me, while giving up less X that I have in abundance. This seems like a fair trade. Since this is the last round, I should accept a beneficial trade while I can.
