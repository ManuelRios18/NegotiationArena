message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from each other's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in giving up most of my X resources. Could we discuss a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, which is a lot more than what Player RED is asking for. I could give 3 Y resources and still have plenty left over. However, Player RED is asking for 4 of my X resources, which is almost all of what I have. I think I can negotiate a better deal.

message: I understand your concerns. How about this trade instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal doesn't give me a net gain in resources, so I'll make a new trade proposal.

message: Thank you, I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed the same trade that I suggested. This trade gives me an additional 3 X resources while only losing 2 Y resources, which is reasonable given my large supply of Y. Since I want to maximize my resources, this trade helps me meet that goal.
