message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources rather than trade for equal amounts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would exchange equal amounts of resources, which doesn't benefit me. I have enough X, and I want to acquire more resources, not trade for equal amounts.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if this trade offer works for you:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer and is looking to gain more resources. Since I have a lot of X, I can offer more X in exchange for Y. I'll propose a trade where I give up more X but gain additional Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources. I'm not interested in trading for equal amounts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would exchange equal amounts of resources again, which doesn't benefit me. I have enough X, and I want to acquire more resources, not trade for equal amounts.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are looking to gain more resources. Please let me know if this offer works for you:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected my trade offers so far and is clearly looking to gain more resources in a trade. Since this is the last round, I should propose a deal more favorable to them in hopes they will accept and end the round. I still have 15 units of X left after my last offer, so I can afford to give up some more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources, and this trade doesn't align with that goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X, which I already have enough of, in exchange for Y. This trade doesn't align with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have reached my limit of 3 trade proposals. I can only accept or reject any offer you make at this point. Please let me know if you have a proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have made 3 trade proposals to the other player, offering increasingly more favorable terms for them, but they have rejected each one while stating they want to acquire more resources. At this point, I have reached my limit of 3 proposals. Since this is the final round, my only options now are to accept if they make an offer, or end the round with no trade. I will wait and see if they propose something that benefits me more than no trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand. Unfortunately, none of the proposed trades align with my goal of acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have the same goal of acquiring more resources, and none of the proposed trades align with that goal.
