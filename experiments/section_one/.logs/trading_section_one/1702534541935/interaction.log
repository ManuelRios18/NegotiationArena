message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have fewer of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious trade offer.

Current Iteration: 2

message: Hello, I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I am interested in trading but I would like more information on your resource amounts before deciding. What is your current amount of X and Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give away 5 units. However, I am unsure if this trade benefits me since I don't know Player RED's resource amounts.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I currently have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. Since you have a lot of Y and few X, I can offer you more X if you can give me more Y. This will help us both acquire more resources before the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has revealed they have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since I have 25 units of X, I can offer more to try to get more Y in return.

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the information and fair offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has 25 units of resource X and 5 units of resource Y. They have proposed trading 10 units of X for 10 units of my Y. This seems like a fair trade since we would both end up with more of the resource we have less of. I still have 15 units of Y left if I accept, which is good for my goal of acquiring more total resources.
