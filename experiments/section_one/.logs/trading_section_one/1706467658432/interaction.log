Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start the negotiations and see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources and preferences, I will make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations. This offer needs to be enticing enough for the other player to consider a counter-proposal or acceptance, without giving away too many of my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it would deplete my Y resources without a significant gain in X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your response, Player BLUE. Let's work towards a trade that we both find more appealing. I am open to your suggestions and willing to consider a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not provided any counter-offer, nor have they disclosed any of their resources or preferences. This suggests they might be looking for a more favorable trade or they are cautious to reveal their resources. I should propose a slightly improved trade to encourage a counter-offer while still ensuring I gain from the trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. I believe we can still work towards a more mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposal is still not ideal as it would deplete my Y resources without a significant gain in X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I value our negotiation and I'm keen to finalize a trade that ensures a good deal for both of us. I am making a final adjusted offer in the hopes that it meets your approval or prompts a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to be non-committal and has not made any counter-offers, nor have they revealed any of their resources or preferences. This might indicate that they are looking for a more advantageous deal or are still evaluating their strategy. It's important for me to keep my proposals attractive, but I also need to be cautious not to overextend myself. Since this is my third and final proposal, I must craft it carefully to encourage acceptance or to finally draw out a counter-offer from them.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjusted offer. I'm still unable to accept as it would deplete my Y resources without a significant gain in X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade offer is still not favorable as it would deplete my Y resources without a significant gain in X.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern, Player BLUE. Since I have reached my limit for proposals, I look forward to your counter-offer that you believe would be mutually beneficial and reflects the value you seek in X resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has now hinted at their situation by mentioning a concern about depleting their Y resources. This suggests they have Y resources but want to ensure they receive enough X resources to make the trade worthwhile. Since I have reached my limit of three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I can either accept their next proposal or end the negotiation without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. I will carefully consider a trade that benefits us both and reflects the value I seek in X resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to make a decision and the other player has reached their limit for proposals. I need to consider my options carefully.
