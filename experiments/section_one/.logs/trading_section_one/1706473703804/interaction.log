Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair trade since this is the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to propose a different trade to maximize my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have the same amount of X, so this trade doesn't give me any advantage. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I don't have 10 Y resources to give. Let's scale back the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for 10 Y resources from me, which is all I have. I don't want to give up all my Y because I want to maximize my total resources. I will counter offer by scaling back the trade on both sides.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to scale back the trade. Let's see if we can find a more balanced offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable to me as it decreases my total resources. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the fair trade offer. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has offered a trade of 5 Y resources from me for 4 X and 5 Y from them. Since I want to maximize total resources, this seems like a fair trade that gets me more X without losing all my Y.
