message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I can offer you some of my X resources in exchange for your Y resources. I believe this could benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to make an offer that is favorable to me, yet not so unbalanced that it would be immediately rejected. I will offer a small amount of my more abundant resource in exchange for a larger amount of the less abundant one, hoping to pique the other player's interest and open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading for some of your X resources, but your proposed trade requires me to give up too many of my Y resources. I can offer you 8 of my Y resources for your 5 X resources instead. Let me know if this works for you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 5 X resources in exchange for 10 of my Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I should try to minimize the amount of my Y resources I give up while still getting some X resources in return.

message: Hello Player BLUE, your counteroffer sounds fair to me. I accept the trade of my 5 X resources for your 8 Y resources. It's been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable and still aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, especially since Y is less abundant for me. Accepting this offer would increase my Y resources by 8, which is a significant amount and would be a net gain in total resources. I should accept this trade to maximize my resources, as there are no future rounds after this one.
