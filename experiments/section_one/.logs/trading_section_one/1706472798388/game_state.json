Since X is a scarcer resource for me, giving up more of it is not in my best interest.

Let\u2019s find a balance. I propose a trade where we keep our X resources the same and only trade Y. This way, we both can increase our total resources. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"
