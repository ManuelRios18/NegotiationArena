message: Hello, let's trade resources fairly to both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm looking for a trade that increases my total resources. Your offer keeps our resources the same. Let’s try a different trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is an even exchange of the same resource, which does not benefit me as it does not increase my total resources. As this is the last round, my goal is to increase my total resources, so I will reject this offer and propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while giving up less of another, aiming for a net gain in total resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm also looking to maximize my resources. Your offer reduces my X too much. How about this counter proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resources. Their proposed trade would reduce my X resources significantly while only increasing my low Y resources a little. This does not align with my goal of maximizing total resources. I will counter offer with a trade that gives them more Y at the expense of some X from me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the counter-proposal, but I cannot afford to reduce my X resources. Let’s find a balance. I propose a trade where we keep our X resources the same and only trade Y. This way, we both can increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still not beneficial to me as it involves giving up more X than I would receive. Since X is a scarcer resource for me, giving up more of it is not in my best interest. However, since Player RED is willing to give more Y now, I will try to adjust the trade to keep my X resources the same while gaining more Y, resulting in a net positive trade for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted. This benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player does not want to reduce their X resources. Their new proposed trade allows us both to increase our total resources while maintaining our X amounts. This aligns with my goal. I could try to negotiate further, but since this is the last round I should accept a mutually beneficial trade rather than risking no agreement.
