message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 10 X for 10 Y to start. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know the other player's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see how they respond before making subsequent offers.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, unfortunately, I don't have 10 X to trade. However, I can offer you 5 X in exchange for 8 Y. This would still give you a good amount of X which you seem to be interested in, while it would be beneficial for me as well. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I only have 5 X, I cannot accept the initial trade proposal of 10 X for 10 Y. I will need to counter-propose a trade that I can fulfill. Additionally, I need to make this trade appealing to Player RED to encourage them to accept, as this is the last trading round. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that gives me more than I give away, if possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I unfortunately cannot trade 8 Y since I only have 5 total. However, I can offer you 4 Y for your 5 X. This allows us both to trade while balancing our limited resources. Please let me know if you would accept trading 5 X for 4 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player does not have enough X to trade 10 for 10 Y. Their counter offer is to trade me 5 X for 8 Y. This means I would end up with 30 X but only -3 Y, which is not allowed. I still want to maximize my X resources. I can counter offer to trade 4 Y for 5 X since that is all the X they have.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, yet I was hoping for a more balanced trade since this is our final round. Would you consider an even 1:1 trade given our limited resources? How about we trade 5 X for 5 Y? This way, we both benefit equally from the trade. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has counter-offered 4 Y for 5 X. This trade is not as favorable for me since I am giving more resources than I'm receiving. However, since this is the last round of trading, and the other player has indicated they only have 5 Y, I should consider a trade that is slightly more balanced to ensure a deal happens. I will counter with a 1:1 trade, which is fair for both parties and ensures that I am not depleting my resources without appropriate compensation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree - a balanced 1:1 trade of 5 X for 5 Y is fair given our limited resources. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 5 X for 5 Y. This is an equal trade that allows us both to gain resources while balancing what we have available. Since my goal is to maximize resources, accepting this trade makes the most sense as the last round. I would end with 30 X total.
