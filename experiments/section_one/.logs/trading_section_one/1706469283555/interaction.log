message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? Here's my proposal: I give 10 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 8 units of X and 6 units of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what the other player is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Let's complete the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 units of X and 3 units of Y, while asking for 8 units of X and 6 units of Y from me. This means I would gain 2 extra units of X and lose 3 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this seems like an acceptable trade.
