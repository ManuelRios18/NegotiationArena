message: Hello! I have more X than Y, so I'm offering to trade some X for Y. Let me know what you think or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources overall. I'd like to propose a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have enough X and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I should propose a counteroffer to get more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: That offer works for me. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 4 of my X for 6 of their Y. This gives me a net gain of 2 more resources, which helps work toward my goal. I should accept this offer since it benefits me.
