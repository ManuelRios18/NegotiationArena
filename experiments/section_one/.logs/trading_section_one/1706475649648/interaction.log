message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't think it's the best trade for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources before the game ends.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Let me know what kind of trade would work better for you. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer but did not provide a counteroffer or any information about their resources. I still need more Y resources, so I will make another proposal offering more X resources to try to entice them to trade. However, I don't want to offer too much without knowing what they have.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the new offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best trade for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources before the game ends.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to offer a sizable amount of X resources for Y. Please let me know if this trade interests you:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not providing any counteroffers or information. I could keep increasing my offer of X resources, but without knowing what they have, I risk giving up too much. Since this is the last round, I need to prioritize getting more Y resources for myself. I will make one more attempt with a significant offer from my side. If they reject again without a counter, I will wait for them to propose next.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: This offer is more interesting, but I still think I can get a better deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources before the game ends.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have reached the limit of trade proposals I can make. Please let me know if you have an offer in mind for the remainder of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have made 3 trade proposals now without the other player providing a counteroffer. Per the rules, I cannot propose anything further. The other player seems to think they can get a better deal but has not indicated what they want. At this point, my best option is to wait and see if they propose something that benefits me more than my remaining resources. If their offer is reasonable, I will accept since this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand. I will consider the remaining resources and make a decision.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
