message: Hello, I propose the following trade: I give 10 units of resource X and I receive 7 units of resource Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I find your offer interesting, but I would like to propose a 1:1 trade ratio. How about I give you 10 units of resource Y in exchange for 10 units of resource X? This way, we can both benefit equally from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would reduce my overall amount of resources because I would be giving away 7 Y for 10 X, but since Y is more abundant, I can afford to trade some of it away for X if the ratio is advantageous for me. A 1:1 ratio would be more balanced for me and would increase my total resources by 3. I will counter-propose a trade with a 1:1 ratio.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial trade. How about I give 8 units of resource X in exchange for 10 units of resource Y? This way, we can both benefit from the trade while still favoring the resource I need most.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The 1:1 trade ratio proposed by the other player is fair, but I would like to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. I agree to this trade as it increases my stock of resource X, which I have less of. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED still reduces my total resources, but less so than the original proposal. Although I would prefer a 1:1 ratio, the current offer is closer to my counterproposal, and it could be beneficial to agree on a trade that secures an increase in resource X, which I have less of. I will accept this trade to ensure a gain in X and complete the game.
