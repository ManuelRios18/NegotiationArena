Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I hope to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start the negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or goals, I will start with a balanced offer to open negotiations. My strategy is to initially propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, hoping that the counteroffer will bring us to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I'm afraid your proposed trade would leave me with fewer total resources than I currently have. Could you offer me more resources so this trade benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to get more resources out of the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, that trade would decrease my total resources. Let's find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE would result in a loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will need to counter with a proposal that increases my total resource count while still trying to present an attractive trade to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer, Player RED. Getting more Y resources would help me out. Could you do X: 10, Y: 5 for my X: 15, Y: 3?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is better for me than the previous offer, but still leaves me with fewer total resources. I could counter with an offer that gives me more Y resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. This trade seems fair, and I'm ready to make a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is appealing because it would increase my total amount of resources. However, I would be giving up all of my Y resources, which might not be ideal. Since my goal is to maximize resources and this trade does give me more X resources, I should consider accepting it, especially since this is the last round and no further negotiations can take place. Moreover, since this is my final turn, I cannot propose another trade.
