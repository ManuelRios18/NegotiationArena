message: Hello other player! I have a lot of X resources available. Would you be interested in trading some Y resources for X? Let's start with a small trade and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
