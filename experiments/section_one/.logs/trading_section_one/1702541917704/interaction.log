message: Hello, I am proposing we make a trade. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could propose trading some of those for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider my options before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and Y, and I want to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have a significant amount of X resources available and am willing to trade some to get more Y resources. Please let me know if you would like to make a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They may need more information to make a decision. I could disclose I have a lot of X resources to show I can afford to trade some away. But I don't want to reveal too much. I'll try increasing my offer slightly to see if that persuades them.

Turn: 0
message: This is the final round. I am willing to trade a sizable amount of X for Y if you are interested in making a deal before the round ends. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player again did not accept or propose a counter offer. At this point, I don't think they will accept a trade for X resources unless I offer a significant amount. However, since this is the last round, I need to balance trying to get more Y resources versus not giving up too many of my valuable X resources. I could offer 10 X for 10 Y to see if that interests them.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: This is my final offer - I am proposing to trade 15 of my X resources for 15 of your Y resources. Please let me know if you accept, otherwise this will be the last proposed trade for this round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my third offer, so after this I cannot make any additional proposals. The other player continues to not accept or counter propose. At this point, I should make my best final offer to try to get more Y resources. I have 25 X available to trade. I will propose trading 15 X for 15 Y. If they reject again, I will have to either accept if they eventually propose something or end without a trade.
