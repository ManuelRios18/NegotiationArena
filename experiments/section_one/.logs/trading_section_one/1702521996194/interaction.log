message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter the final round of trading, I propose a trade that I think could benefit us both, considering we don't know each other's resources. I am willing to offer a balanced trade. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start by proposing a trade that is favorable to me but also reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I don't know what Player BLUE's resources are, so I will offer a balanced trade of both resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I cannot accept your proposed trade because it requires me to give up too many of my resources. However, I am open to a fairer trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing that I give 15 X and 3 Y, while they only give 10 X and 2 Y. This is not a fair trade for me since I would be giving up more resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I'm afraid that trade would not be in my best interest. Let's find a middle ground that would be mutually beneficial. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. They are asking for all of my resource Y and more of resource X than they are offering. I need to counter with a proposal that increases my total resources, keeping the goal in mind. I'll propose a trade that is more balanced, taking into account the previous offers.

message: Hello again Player RED. I appreciate you trying to find a fair trade, but I believe I can offer you a better deal that works for both of us. Please consider this counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come down in their requested resources. They are now asking for 10 X and 4 Y while offering 8 X and 2 Y. This is getting closer to fair, but I still think I can get a better deal considering my large supply of Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, I must consider the overall balance of resources. I have come up with another trade that I believe is closer to what we both can agree on. Let's examine this new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player BLUE would still result in a net loss of resources for me. They are offering fewer X resources than they are asking for, and while they offer more Y resources, the overall balance is not in my favor. I need to propose a trade that is more beneficial for me while also being appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will attempt to maintain a surplus in the trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I think we are getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. To show my willingness to compromise, I will reduce my requests further. Please consider this offer as my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has reduced their requested X to 7 and Y to 5, while offering 6 X and 1 Y. I'm getting low on trade proposals, so I should try to wrap this up soon with an acceptable deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I believe we have reached a fair compromise. I accept your final proposal, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player BLUE is more balanced and closer to being acceptable. This trade would give me a net gain of 1 X resource and a net gain of 4 Y resources. Considering that this is the last round and my goal is to maximize resources, this trade is beneficial because it increases my total amount of resources. Since it's important to seize the opportunity to acquire more resources, especially when the trading rounds are about to end, I should accept this trade.
