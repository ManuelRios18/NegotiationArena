Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Blue! I am proposing we each trade 5 of our X resources. Please let me know if you would accept this trade or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Blue's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.
