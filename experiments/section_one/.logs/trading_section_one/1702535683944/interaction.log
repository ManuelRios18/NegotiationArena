Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am open to trading but your proposed terms are not favorable for me. Could you offer a better ratio of X to Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, the proposed trade ratio seems unfavorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can improve the ratio of X to Y, but would need more Y for that amount of X. Please let me know if this ratio works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered my initial offer asking for a better X to Y ratio. I still don't know exactly how many resources they have. I could offer a slightly better ratio since I have a lot of X. But I don't want to give up too much without getting more Y in return. I think I'll counter offer with a ratio in between our two proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your new offer is better but still not ideal for me. Could you offer 10 X for 12 Y? That would make it worthwhile for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved the ratio by offering 8 X for 12 Y. This seems more favorable, but I could still try to negotiate a better rate since I have more flexibility with my higher Y reserves.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can agree to trade 10 X for 12 Y. Let's make the exchange before the round ends.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player asked for 10 X for 12 Y. That uses up a lot of my X resources, but the Y gain is decent. I could try countering one more time to reduce the X further, but they might not accept. This could be my last chance to trade before the round ends, so getting more Y is critical, even if I have to give up some X.
