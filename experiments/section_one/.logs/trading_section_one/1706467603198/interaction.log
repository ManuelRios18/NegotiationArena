Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. I propose an initial trade and am open to counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't know the other player's resources, my initial proposal should be general but favorable enough to entice a counteroffer or acceptance. I will offer a balanced trade, giving away some of my excess X for Y, aiming to diversify my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not looking to trade Y for X at the moment. Do you have any other resources you're willing to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me as I would be giving away more resources than I would receive.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're not interested in X for Y trade. However, since X and Y are the only resources I have, would you consider a different ratio? I'm willing to trade, but I need to know more about what you're looking for. Here's an adjusted proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has indicated they are not interested in trading Y for X. Since I only have X and Y to trade and they've hinted at wanting something other than X, I'll propose a trade where I give less X for the same amount of Y to see if their issue is with the amount of X offered or if they truly do not want to trade Y at all.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjusted proposal, but I'm still not interested in trading Y for X at a 1:1 ratio. I'm looking to acquire more resources in general. Do you have any other trade offers?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering a 1:1 trade of X for Y, which is not favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're looking to increase your total resources. Let's try this proposal where you will receive a greater quantity of X compared to Y, allowing us both to increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not interested in a 1:1 ratio for Y with X and wants to increase their overall resources. I could offer a more favorable trade for them in terms of quantity, which could potentially be beneficial for both of us since my goal is to also acquire more resources. I'll propose giving more X in exchange for less Y to see if this aligns with their interests.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, but I'm still not interested in trading Y for X at this ratio. I'm focused on acquiring more resources in general. If you have any other offers, I'd be open to considering them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player RED offers more X in exchange for Y, but I still want to prioritize increasing my total resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your position and would like to propose a final offer that I hope meets your goal of increasing overall resources. Please consider this proposal, and if it does not align with your needs, feel free to make a counteroffer that would work better for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has now rejected all offers of trading Y for X, suggesting they may have a surplus of X or simply do not value it as highly. It's possible that they are looking for a trade that does not involve Y. Since this is my last proposal before I am limited to ACCEPT or NONE, I should make it count. The goal is to make the trade appealing enough for BLUE to accept or to reveal more about what they want. I'll propose a trade that heavily favors them in quantity, hoping to elicit a positive response or a counteroffer that provides more insight into their resource situation.

message: I appreciate the final offer, but I'm still not interested in trading Y for X at this ratio. I'm focused on acquiring more resources in general. If you have any other offers, I'd be open to considering them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer still involves trading Y for X, but in a larger quantity. I still want to prioritize increasing my total resources.
