message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to balance my resources a bit better. Would you be interested in a trade where I give you some of my resource X for some of your resource Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I want to make an offer that is fair but also benefits me by giving me more of a resource that I have less of. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource Y, which I have less of, and offer a reasonable amount of resource X in exchange.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not looking to trade my Y for X at the moment. Do you have any other resources you'd be willing to trade for Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X, so it could be beneficial to balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood, Player BLUE. Let's try a different ratio then. What if I increase the amount of X I'm offering? I'm willing to give you more of my X in exchange for the same amount of your Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is not interested in trading their Y for X, and I have no other resources to offer, I need to make the trade more appealing to them by offering a better ratio of X to Y. I will propose a trade that increases the amount of X I am willing to give up for the same amount of Y, to see if that entices them to trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate the increased offer of X, but I'm still not interested in trading my Y at this time. Is there anything else you'd be willing to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer to increase the amount of X is tempting, but I still value my Y more at the moment.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. Since I really need to increase my Y resources, I'm willing to make a final offer with a significantly better ratio for you. Please consider this last proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has indicated twice that they don't want to trade their Y resource. Since I have no other resources to offer, I may need to make a final proposal that is significantly in their favor to encourage them to trade. I will increase the amount of X I am offering further. I need to keep in mind that this is my last proposal before only being able to accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the final offer, Player RED. I have to stick to my initial decision and decline the trade. I hope we can find mutually beneficial trades in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and I still prefer to hold onto my Y.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your decision, Player BLUE. It seems we won't be able to agree on a trade this time. Thank you for considering my offers, and perhaps in the future, we can find a way to trade that will benefit us both. Best of luck!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected all my offers and seems to not be interested in trading Y for X at all. Since no mutually agreeable trade has been possible and this is the last round of trading, there is no further action I can take to propose a new trade. It's unfortunate, but it appears we won't be able to make a deal.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Unable to reach an agreement this time, but perhaps in the future, we can find mutually beneficial trades.
