Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my stock of resource Y. I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. Let's start this off on a cooperative note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the start of the game and I have no information on the other player's resources, I'll make an initial balanced offer that would allow me to increase my resources while also being fair to the other player. I will aim to gain more of resource Y, as I have significantly more of resource X.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This is a fair trade. I am happy to exchange some of my ample Y resources to help us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. I have plenty of Y to spare, so this seems like a good trade to accept.
