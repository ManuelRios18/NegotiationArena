message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading some Y for X to balance my resources, but your proposed trade ratio seems unbalanced. Could you propose something more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 3 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, trading 3 Y for 5 X seems unbalanced in RED's favor.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a trade of 3X for 2Y. This seems more balanced and I'm willing to accept less Y in order to give up less X. I still don't know exactly how many resources they have, but I should accept this trade since X is more plentiful for me.
