Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the fair trade offer, but I need to consider my resources and goals carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a fair trade, but I need to ensure that I am maximizing my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y available for trading. What resources do you have and what trade offer would you propose?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. This likely means they need more information about what I have available to trade before making a decision. I will disclose some of my resources to see if we can come to an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y available for trading. I will propose a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking about my resources and potential trade offers. I should consider proposing a trade that maximizes my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You seem to need Y and I need X. How about this counter offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has the opposite resource distribution as me. Their proposed trade is fair and benefits both sides equally. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my total resources. I can counter offer to get more X while giving up all my Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see that you need X and I need Y, but I would like to propose a trade that benefits both of us more evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is making a counter offer, but I need to ensure that I am maximizing my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade as it allows me to maximize my resources in this last round.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with a trade that splits the benefit more evenly. This gives me 10 more X for all of my remaining Y. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this trade helps me achieve that. I will accept it as it maximizes my resources.
