Turn: 0
message: Hello, I would like to trade some of my excess X for your Y. Please let me know if you'd be interested in trading 5 X for 3 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see if they counteroffer.

message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the X!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of my Y. Since I have plenty of Y and getting more resources in general is better, this seems like a good trade for me.
