message: Hi, I'm Player RED. I'd like to propose a trade to see if we can both benefit from it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit each other.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate the trade offer, but I'm looking for a deal that would increase my total resources. Would you be interested in a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would result in a net loss of resources for me. They are offering 5 X and 2 Y, which is a total of 7 units, in exchange for my 3 X and 5 Y, which total 8 units. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would not be beneficial to me. To make a counter-offer, I will aim to trade fewer Y resources while getting a good amount of X since I have a surplus of Y.

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: No problem, Player RED. Take your time to consider the trade, and let me know if you'd like to propose an alternative or accept the trade I've offered. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not made a counter-offer, I can only assume they are either evaluating their strategy or are not interested in the trade I proposed. There's no new information to make a new decision, so I will wait for Player RED to propose a trade or accept my previous offer.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
