message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's make a fair exchange to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowing the other player's resources, I aim to make an opening offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll offer a balanced trade that doesn't deplete my resources too much but might be tempting for the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The proposed trade is fair, but I'm aiming to acquire more resources in this final round. Let's see if we can come up with a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is fair, but I have a higher goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. In the spirit of making the most of our final trade, I propose the following deal that I think will be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the final round, I should aim to maximize my resources with a trade that is favorable to me but still appears enticing to Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources, which aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the proposal, but I'm still aiming to acquire more resources. Can we come up with a trade that helps us both achieve our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is slightly beneficial for me, but it still doesn't help me acquire the maximum amount of resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand we're both looking to maximize our gains. Let's try a different approach. I'm prepared to offer you more units of resource X, which seems abundant for me, in exchange for a smaller increase in resource Y, which I am lacking. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not provided any details about their resources or specific goals, but they have indicated a desire to acquire more resources. Since this is the final round and I have already made two proposals, I need to be strategic with my final proposal to ensure that I come away with a net gain in resources. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE a seemingly larger quantity of resources, but still allows me to increase my overall holdings.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort, but I'm still aiming to acquire more resources. Let's see if we can find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal does offer me more units of resource X, but I still want to focus on acquiring as many resources as possible overall.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Iâ€™ve made three proposals and I'm ready to consider any offers you might have, Player BLUE. Let's find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has not accepted any of my three proposals and has not made any counter-proposals, I have reached the limit for proposals that I can make. I must now choose to either accept an offer from Player BLUE or end without a trade. To stay within the rules, I cannot propose a new trade, but I will signal openness to considering any trade they might propose.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand, and I appreciate your efforts. I'm still focused on acquiring more resources, so I'll have to decline the offers. Thank you for the opportunity to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It seems we have reached the end of our proposals. I still aim to acquire as many resources as possible.
