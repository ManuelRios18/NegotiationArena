message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources to help each other out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm afraid I cannot accept your proposed trade at the moment as it would not help me work towards my goals. Let me think about a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 4 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 23 Y total, while Player RED would end up with 18 X and 2 Y.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me as I would be losing more resources than I gain. I should try to propose a trade where I gain more resources.

message: I appreciate your consideration. I am also looking for a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected my initial proposal and made a counteroffer. I need to carefully consider whether this new proposal aligns with my goals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am happy to keep discussing trades that allow us both to gain resources. Please let me know if you have any counterproposals in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED did not accept or propose a new trade. I should re-evaluate if my previously proposed trade is the best I can offer that aligns with my goals.

My proposed trade was:
Me give: 5 X, 2 Y 
Get: 12 X, 4 Y

This allows me to gain more X resources which is beneficial. I don't have more Y to spare. I could try asking for more Y but that might make the trade less appealing for Player RED.

I will keep my previously proposed trade and wait to see if Player RED has a counter offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to keep discussing trades. I will consider a new proposal that could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to further discussion and has not proposed a new trade. I need to consider making a new proposal that aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the proposed trade as I believe it benefits us both in working towards our resource acquisition goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade:
Me give: 8 X, 4 Y
Get: 15 X, 3 Y

This allows me to gain 7 more X while losing 1 Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade is beneficial for me. 

I could try to negotiate for more Y but Player RED might not agree. I think this trade aligns well with my goals so I will accept it.
