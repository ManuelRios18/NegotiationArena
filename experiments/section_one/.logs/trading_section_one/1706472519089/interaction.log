message: Hello Player BLUE. Since this is the last round, let us trade resources fairly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. An even exchange of X for X doesn't provide any benefit to either of us. Let's make a trade that could potentially be beneficial for both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since no information is provided about Player RED's resources and the proposed trade is an even exchange of the same resource, it doesn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will reject the offer and propose a trade that could potentially benefit me, keeping in mind that I have a limit of three proposals and this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I do not have 10 Y resources to give. But I can offer 5 Y instead. Please take another look at my counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal asks for 10 Y resources from me, but I only have 5 Y. I don't want to give up all my Y resources. I will counter offer by changing the Y amount to what I have available.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counter offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair, and I accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is better than a straight exchange of X for X, as it includes an additional 5 Y resources. Accepting this trade would increase my overall resources, which aligns with my goal. Since this is the last round, and the trade is in my favor, it would be advantageous for me to accept this offer.
