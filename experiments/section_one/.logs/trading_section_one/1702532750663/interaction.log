message: Hello! I am proposing we trade resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I can afford to give some away to get more Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I will start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading X for Y could be beneficial as I have an equal amount of X and the goal is to acquire more resources overall.

message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered my original offer by proposing to give me more Y resources (15 instead of 10). This is beneficial for me since I am trying to acquire more Y. I should accept this trade since it aligns with my goals.
