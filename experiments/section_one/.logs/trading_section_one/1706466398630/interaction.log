message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to balance my resources. I propose the following trade to see if it aligns with your interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I want to open with an offer that is favorable to me but still leaves room for negotiation. I aim to trade more of my abundant resource (X) for the less abundant one (Y) to balance my portfolio and maximize total resources.

message: This trade works for me. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 4 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be gaining more resources overall.
