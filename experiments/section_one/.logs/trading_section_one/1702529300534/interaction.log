message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I will start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly revised trade. I am willing to trade my Y for your X, but I would like a better exchange rate given that I have a surplus of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity, but without knowing the value they place on each resource, it's difficult to determine if this trade is beneficial. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and we have a surplus of Y, trading an equal amount could be advantageous if X is of higher or equal value to us. I will propose a counteroffer that slightly favors us by asking for a bit more of their X in exchange for our Y. This is the first proposal out of the three I am allowed.

message: I can increase my offer to a 2:3 ratio - 8 of my X for 12 of your Y. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 6 of my X resources in exchange for 5 of their Y resources. My original offer was a 1:1 ratio, but they want a better rate since they have more Y. I could counter offer a 2:3 ratio - give up a bit more X but get more Y in return. This aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources overall.

message: Your offer sounds reasonable, and I'm happy to proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade offer from Player RED is less favorable than the previous one. Originally, they offered 5 X for 5 Y, which is a 1:1 ratio. Now they are offering a 2:3 ratio, which means I would be giving more Y for less X in comparison to the original offer. However, since I have a surplus of Y, accepting this trade would still increase my total resource count, aligning with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. As this is the last round of trading, and I have not made a trade yet, securing additional X resources would be beneficial.
