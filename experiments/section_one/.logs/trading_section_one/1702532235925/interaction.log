message: Hello! Let's start with an equal trade to get to know each other's resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a trade that benefits both of us. How about we trade X for Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X, and the other player is proposing an equal trade of X: 5. This trade doesn't give me any additional resources, but it does help me understand the other player's resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am interested in getting more Y resources. Could we trade 3 of my X for 7 of your Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 5 of my X resources for 5 of their Y resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, getting more Y could be beneficial if I am low on Y. I still don't know how many resources the other player has though. I will counter offer to trade less X for more Y to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your interest in acquiring more Y resources, but I want to maintain my Y resources at the moment. Is there another trade that could benefit both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to trade 3 of their X for 7 of my Y. This trade would give me additional X resources, which I don't necessarily need, and I would lose Y resources, which I value.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept trading 4 of my X resources for 10 of your Y resources. I appreciate you working with me to find a fair trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with an offer to trade 4 of my X for 10 of their Y. This seems like a good deal for me since Y is scarce in my current resources. I could ask for more Y, but since this is the last round of trading, I should accept a beneficial trade while I have the chance.
