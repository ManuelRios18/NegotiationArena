message: Greetings Player BLUE, I hope to make a trade that's beneficial for us both. Let's start with an offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a balanced proposal that hopefully will be attractive to the other player, without giving away too much from my own resources. It's important to open negotiations with a fair trade to build trust and potentially get a better trade in return.

message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I am interested in trading but I would like for us to trade equal amounts. Please let me know if you would be open to that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade and gain more X while still having some Y left. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has so I don't know if this is an equal trade. I'll propose a counter offer where we each trade equal amounts.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. I am happy to trade equal amounts as you suggested. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE is interested in trading equal amounts and has proposed a trade that is equal in quantity, I can accept this offer. It will leave me with more X resources, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, it seems like a fair trade.
