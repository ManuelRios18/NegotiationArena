Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade evenly to start. I have some X and Y available. What do you have to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This is an acceptable trade for me. I am interested in acquiring more resources overall.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 5 for 5 trade in resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should accept trades that give me more resources overall.
