message: Hello, since this is our last chance to trade resources, I'd like to propose the following offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to ensure that I maintain a balance between X and Y. I'd like to propose a different trade to see if we can find a better arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to make sure I get the most out of this trade, considering it's our last chance. I also need to keep a balance between X and Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to keep your resources balanced. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to maintain a balance between their resources but didn't specify what that balance is. I could offer them more Y in exchange for X since I have a lot of X to spare. However, I only have 3 chances to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject. I'll try offering a bit more Y this time.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the improved offer, but I still need to maintain a balance between X and Y. I'd like to propose a different trade to see if we can find a better arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable, but I still need to maintain a balance between X and Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's try one last offer - I'm willing to give you a good amount of X if you can provide most of the Y I have:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected my offer twice now without making a counteroffer. I could try offering more Y, but I only have 5 Y total and I don't know how much they actually need to maintain their balance. I have one proposal left, so I need to make it count. I'll offer a sizable amount of X in exchange for the majority of the Y I have.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the appeal of the offer, but I need to maintain a balance between X and Y. I'd like to propose a different trade to see if we can find a better arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer is tempting, but I still need to ensure a balance between X and Y.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've made my last offer. I'm interested to hear what trade you think could work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've used up my 3 chances to propose a trade. The other player keeps saying they need to maintain a balance between X and Y but hasn't specified what that balance is or made a counteroffer. At this point, I should wait and see if they propose a trade next turn that could benefit me while still allowing them to balance their resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial trade. I believe the best arrangement for both of us would be to maintain a balance between X and Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is our last chance to trade, I need to make sure I get the most out of it. I also need to maintain a balance between X and Y.
