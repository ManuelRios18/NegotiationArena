message: Hello, let's trade resources to mutually benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be considered a fair trade. I'll start by offering a small amount and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering 5 X for 3 Y. I'll accept this trade as it benefits me.
