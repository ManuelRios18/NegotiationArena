Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, since this is the last round let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade. I can offer some X resources in exchange for some Y resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer. I need to think about the trade before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X resources but I have more Y resources than the other player. I need to consider how much I value my Y resources compared to their X resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time to consider the offer. Let me know if you have a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They said they need to think about it. I will wait and see if they come back with a counter proposal that works for both of us. Since there are no more rounds after this, it is in our mutual interest to trade rather than ending without trading anything.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. I will consider the trade and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to a counter proposal. I need to consider how to maximize my resources in the final trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, let me know what you decide.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still thinking about the initial offer and has not proposed a counter offer yet. Since this is the final round, I will wait to see what they propose rather than changing my offer at this point. If they reject my initial offer, I can propose something else as I still have 2 proposals left.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I will finalize my decision soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is waiting for my decision. I need to carefully evaluate the trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No worries, let me know when you've made your decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still undecided. I will continue waiting since I still have 2 proposals left in case my initial offer is rejected. Pushing for a quick response may make them less likely to accept. If this was not the final round, I may have changed my offer by now, but since it's the last chance I'll wait it out.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I have decided to accept the trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: Player BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to make a decision on the trade and ensure it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
