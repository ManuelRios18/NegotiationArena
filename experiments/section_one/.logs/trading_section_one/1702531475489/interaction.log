message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm not interested in trading X for Y, but I'm open to other proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X, so I don't need more. I want to get more X for Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know what kind of trade you would be interested in.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading X for Y. I still don't know what resources they have. I'll try proposing a different trade with smaller amounts to see if I can get some information.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm focused on acquiring more resources without trading Y for X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still don't want to trade Y for X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Let me know if you'd be open to trading something else.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Z: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems set on not trading Y for X. I could try offering Y for something else, but I don't have very much Y to give up. I'll try one more proposal offering a different resource and see if they respond with any useful information before deciding whether to accept a trade or not.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately, I don't have Z to trade. Is there anything else you'd be interested in?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I don't have Z, so I can't trade it.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Since I'm not sure what resources you have, let me know what you think would be a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Any Resource: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player does not have Z. They asked what else I would be interested in, but I still don't know what resources they actually have. I'm down to my last proposal, so I should make one that has a decent chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X for an unspecified resource. If they reject again, I will have to carefully consider their next proposal before accepting.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in trading for X at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X, so I don't need more.
