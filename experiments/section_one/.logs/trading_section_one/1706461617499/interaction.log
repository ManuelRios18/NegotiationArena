message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's start off with a fair trade. I propose the following and look forward to counter-offers if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make a balanced offer that would appear fair without undervaluing my own resources. I will propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering some of both of my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposed trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 5 X and 5 Y from me. This would result in me having 10 X and 22 Y total, while the other player would have 5 X and 7 Y.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be getting more resources overall. I don't know what resources the other player has available to them, but from my perspective this trade allows me to gain more.

I will accept the trade since it aligns with my goal of maximizing my resources.
