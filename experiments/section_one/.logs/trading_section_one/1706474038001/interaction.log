message: Hello, let's have a good trade. I have a lot of X and could use more Y. Would you like to trade some Y for X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing a small trade to test the waters.

message: That trade works for me. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X in exchange for 5 Y. Since I have plenty of Y and could use more X, this seems like a reasonable trade to accept.
