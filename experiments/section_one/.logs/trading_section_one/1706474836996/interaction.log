message: Hello Blue! Let's trade resources. I propose an even trade since I don't know what you have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Blue's resources so I'll start with an even trade to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently do not have any resources I can part with and gain more overall resources. Do you have another offer in mind that could benefit us both in total resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 5 for 5 trade in resource X. Since I have 5 units of X, this trade would not change my total resources. However, since more resources are always better and this is the last round, I should try to gain more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer 10 X for 5 Y since I have more X. Would that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Blue does not have resources to spare but is asking for a trade that benefits us both. I have lots of X to spare so I can offer more. I'll propose giving 10 X for 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer Player RED. This trade benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is now proposing 10 X for 5 Y. This would increase my total resources from 30 to 35. Since more resources are always better and this is the last round, I should accept this trade.
