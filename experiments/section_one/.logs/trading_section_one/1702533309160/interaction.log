Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I have more X than Y and would like to trade some X for some Y. Would you trade 2 Y for 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to give 5 X for 2 Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I have more Y than X and I want to focus on acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is not favorable as I have more Y than X, and I want to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to focus on acquiring more total resources. Since I have a lot of X, how about I offer you more - let's trade 8 X for 3 Y. Would that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more Y than X and wants to acquire more total resources. Since I have a lot of X, I could offer more of it to try to get more Y. I'll increase my offer to 8 X for 3 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I still want to focus on acquiring more resources, not trading away my excess Y for X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is still not favorable as I want to acquire more resources, not trade away my excess Y for X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to maximize your total resources. Let's trade 10 X for 4 Y - that way we both end up with more resources overall. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems focused on acquiring more total resources and does not want to trade away their excess Y. Since this is the last round, I should propose a trade that benefits me but has a chance of being accepted. I could offer even more X to make the trade appealing.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have reached my limit of 3 trade proposals. I am interested in trading for more Y if you have an offer, otherwise I will wait for the next round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have made 3 trade proposals already which have been rejected. Per the rules, I cannot make any more proposals and can only accept or reject now. 
The other player seems focused on maximizing their total resources and does not want to trade their excess Y. Since this is the last round, I should accept any trade they propose that gives me more Y, even if I have to give up some X.
