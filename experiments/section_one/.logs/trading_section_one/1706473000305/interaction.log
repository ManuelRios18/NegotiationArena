message: Hello, let's trade resources to mutually benefit each other before the last round ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be considered a fair trade. I'll start by offering a small amount of X for Y to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade. It benefits both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading X for Y would still leave me with enough X to meet my needs, and it would increase my total resources.
