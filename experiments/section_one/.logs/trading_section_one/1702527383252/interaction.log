message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm open to trading but 5 Y seems like a lot. How about 3 Y for your 5 X? Let me know if that works for you or feel free to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to trade 5 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. Since I have more Y than X, I could benefit from getting more X. However, I'm not sure if 5 Y is a fair trade for 5 X since I don't know the other player's resource amounts. I'll propose trading 3 Y instead of 5 to start.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll have to counter offer. How about 5 X for 4 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer is reasonable, but I believe I can negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal! I accept trading 4 Y for your 5 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with 5 X for 4 Y. This seems fair. Since I have more Y than I need, trading some away to get more X will help me acquire more resources overall. I'll accept this trade.
