message: Hello, let's trade resources fairly since this is the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know the other player's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to acquire more Y resources if possible in this trade. Could you offer some Y resources in addition to the X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y in return for my X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have limited Y resources. I can offer 1 Y in addition to the X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more Y resources. I only have 5 Y resources so I cannot offer too many. I will counter offer with 1 Y resource since my goal is to maximize my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the additional Y resource. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED can offer 1 additional Y resource. Since I want to maximize my resources, getting the additional Y is beneficial. I will accept this trade.
