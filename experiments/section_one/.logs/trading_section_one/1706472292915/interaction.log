my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED

Turn: 1
message: This trade gives me more total resources, so I am happy to accept it. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me more total resources (10 + 3 = 13) than what they are asking for (6 + 4 = 10). This seems like a good trade for me.
