message: Hello! I have more X resources available. Would you like to trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

message: I understand you want to keep your Y resources. I still have a lot of extra X available. Would you trade some other resource you may have for more X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives any other resource: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
