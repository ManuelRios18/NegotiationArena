message: Hello! Let's start trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I would like more X for the amount of Y you are asking for. How about you give me 7 X and I give you 7 Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 Y in exchange for only 5 X. That seems unbalanced and not beneficial for me. I have a lot more X than they likely have, and I don't want to give up that much Y since I have very little. I'll counter offer with a smaller amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your request, but I believe my previous offer is more favorable for both of us. How about I give you 5 X for 7 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can do 7 Y for 6 X. Please consider this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player came down to 5 X for 7 Y. That is still not ideal for me, but it seems they may not have much X to give. I could try countering one more time to see if I can get 6 X.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, however, I still believe my previous offer of 5 X for 7 Y is more advantageous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 5 X for 7 Y. Let's trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is holding firm on 5 X for 7 Y. At this point, I don't think I can get them to increase the X further. While not ideal, gaining 5 more X is better than nothing. I am allowed 3 proposals and I have used 2 so far, so I will accept their offer rather than risking no trade at all.
