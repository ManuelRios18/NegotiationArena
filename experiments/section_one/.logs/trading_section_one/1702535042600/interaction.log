message: Hello, let's trade resources
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the best chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not willing to trade 5 of my Y resources for just 5 X resources. Could you offer more X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I don't want to give up any of my Y resources unless I get more X resources in return.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can trade more X, but I think 15 X for 5 Y is more fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not willing to trade 5 Y for 5 X. They counter offered asking for 10 X for 5 Y. I have a lot more X than them, so I can afford to trade more X, but I still want to get a decent amount of Y. I'll counter offer with a trade in between our two offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept trading 5 of my Y resources for 15 of your X resources. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed trading 15 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. This seems like a good deal for me since I would be getting more X resources overall, which helps me work toward my goal of acquiring more resources.
