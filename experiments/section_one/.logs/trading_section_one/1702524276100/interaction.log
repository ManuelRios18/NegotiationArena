message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? I'm looking to acquire more resources to strengthen my position.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I accept your proposed trade as it allows me to gain more total resources while also providing you with more X to strengthen your position. I look forward to successful trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 4 units of X and 4 units of Y from me. This would result in me having 6 units of X and 23 units of Y after the trade, while Player RED would have 9 units of X and 2 units of Y.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me because I would be getting more total resources (7 total) than what I would be giving away (8 total). 

I don't know Player RED's resource amounts or goals, but they seem interested in acquiring more X, likely to strengthen their position as they said. This trade helps them do that while allowing me to gain more total resources.

Since this is the last round and I can't make more than 3 trade proposals, I should accept trades that get me more total resources when possible.
