message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from each other's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings! I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is equal in terms of quantity, but with no knowledge of Player RED's resources, I cannot determine whether this is beneficial for me or not. I should counter with a proposal that leans more in my favor, given that it's the last round and I want to maximize my resources. I should also consider not revealing my resource amounts to keep my advantage.

message: I understand your proposal, but I believe we can find a trade that benefits us both more equally. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3, X: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade doesn't benefit me much, so I'll make a new offer.

Turn: 1
message: This trade seems fair and balanced. I'm happy to proceed with this exchange. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal suggests a balanced exchange of both resources, but it seems to be tilted slightly in my favor as I would end up with a net gain of 2 Y resources. However, without knowing RED's resources, it's hard to gauge whether they would be at a disadvantage. Given that it's the last round and my goal is to maximize resources, accepting a balanced offer might be the best course of action, especially since I don't know if I can get a better deal with my remaining proposals.
