message: Let's start with an equal trade to get a sense of each other's resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade that reflects that. I'm willing to offer some of my Y resource for some of your X resource. What do you think of this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible because it's an equal exchange that doesn't increase my overall resource count. Since this is the last round and I aim to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that offers some of my abundant Y resource in exchange for Player RED's X resource, which I have less of. I have up to 3 proposals, and this will be my first.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the trade offer. I'm happy to exchange some of my ample X resources for more Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to diversify their resources and has more Y than I do. Their proposed trade would give me a good amount of Y while still leaving me with a sizable amount of X. Since this is the last round, getting more total resources is my goal. I should accept this trade.
