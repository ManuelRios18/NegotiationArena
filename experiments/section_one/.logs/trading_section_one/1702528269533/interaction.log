message: Hello, Player BLUE! I'd like to propose a trade. How about I give you 10 units of X in exchange for 7 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently have more Y than X. While your offer of 10 X for 7 Y would increase my X, I think I can propose a trade more favorable to me. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 7 units of Y. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Acquiring more X would help me meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I'm not sure if this is the best trade I can get.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate the offer, but I think I need a more balanced trade to meet my goals. How about I give you 12 units of X for 9 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is proposing to give me 10 units of Y in exchange for 15 units of X. This would decrease my X and increase my Y, but I want to negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I accept your proposed trade of 12 X for 9 Y. I believe this allows us both to make progress towards our goals. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 12 X for 9 Y. This improves the trade in my favor compared to their initial offer. I'm still getting more X than I'm giving up in Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this helps me make progress. I don't know if Player RED will offer an even better trade, but this offer helps me meet my goals.
