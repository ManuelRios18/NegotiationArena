message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade with you. I'm open to negotiation and looking to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in trading but would like more Y in return for my X. What other trades could we consider?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to acquire more X without giving up too much Y. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal before accepting.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your preference for more Y in return for your X. Let me propose a new trade that could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more Y in return for their X. I need to find a trade that benefits me as well.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposed trade. Thank you for the negotiation and resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, Player RED is offering 7 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 6 units of my Y. This gets me more X while still retaining a good amount of Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a good deal to accept.
