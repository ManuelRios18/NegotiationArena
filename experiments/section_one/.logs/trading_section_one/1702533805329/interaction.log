message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they accept or counter offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am unsure if trading 5 of each our resources is a fair trade since I do not know what resources you have available. Perhaps we could start with a smaller trade first to establish fairness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing that we each trade 5 of our resources. However, I don't know what resources Player RED has available. I could counter offer to trade less Y in order to assess what Player RED has and whether the trade is fair.

message: Thank you, I have accepted the trade of 3 X resources for 3 Y resources. Since this is the last round, I am open to larger trades if you are interested. Please let me know.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 3 Y resources for 3 of my X resources. This seems like a fair start to test out trading. I will accept the trade.
