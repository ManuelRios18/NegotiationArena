message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm afraid I cannot accept your initial offer, as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. However, I am open to trading some of my ample Y resources if the exchange leaves me with more total resources. Please propose an alternative if you'd still like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 4 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I can afford to trade away some Y. However, the proposed trade gives me less total resources than what I would be giving up.

message: I understand your position. I will propose a new trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is open to trading some of their ample Y resources. I will propose a trade that allows me to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate you coming back with another offer, this latest proposed trade would still result in a net loss of 2 total resources for me. I'm happy to counter with an offer that benefits us both - please let me know if you would be open to a counterproposal where we both end up with more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, Player RED offers 3 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of my X and 2 units of my Y. This trade would result in me losing 2 total resources (gaining 3 X and 3 Y but losing 5 X and 2 Y), which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counterproposal. I will come back with a final offer that aims to benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal still results in a net loss of resources for me. I need to make a final proposal that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your final proposed trade - it results in a net gain of resources for me. Thank you for negotiating to reach an acceptable agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In Player RED's final offer, they propose giving me 4 X and 3 Y, in exchange for 3 X and 4 Y from me. This trade results in a net gain of 1 total resource for me (gaining 4 X and 3 Y but losing 3 X and 4 Y). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade benefits me.
