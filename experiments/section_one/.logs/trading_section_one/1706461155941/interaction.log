message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose a balanced trade to start with. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize the resources I can acquire. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am looking to gain more resources in this trade since there are no future rounds. Could you propose something where I gain some X and/or Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 10 X and 2 Y for 12 X and 1 Y from me. This would reduce my total resources, so I should reject it and propose something more favorable where I gain resources. Since there are no future rounds, I should try to maximize my resources in this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I see that you're looking to increase your resources. I'm willing to give up some of my Y in exchange for more X, but the current proposal is not beneficial enough for me. Here's a counteroffer that might work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not attractive as it doesn't allow me to increase my overall resources. I will counter-propose with a trade that allows me to gain more X while giving up some Y, trying to ensure that I end up with more total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, while I appreciate your willingness to give up some Y, your proposal takes too much X from me without giving enough Y in return. Let's try to find a fair trade that benefits both of us in resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my proposal and countered with giving me 3 Y for 15 X. This would significantly reduce my X without gaining much Y. I should reject this and see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I understand your need for a fair exchange. However, your last proposal doesn't align with my goal of increasing my total resources. Here's another proposal that should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE would result in a net loss of resources for me, as I would be giving up more than I receive. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not acceptable. However, to move towards a compromise, I will make a counteroffer that allows Player BLUE to gain in one resource while ensuring I still end up with a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, your latest proposal works for me - I can gain some additional X resources while giving up a smaller amount of Y. Let's complete this trade. Thank you for working with me to find a mutually beneficial exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my last proposal and offered a new trade of giving me 7 X for 5 Y from me. This allows me to gain X while giving up a smaller amount of Y, aligning with my goal of maximizing total resources. I should accept this offer since it benefits me.
