message: Hello Player BLUE. Since this is the last round, let us trade in a way that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I agree that this trade should benefit both of us. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. This trade benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE wants 7 X and all 5 of my Y resources in exchange for 10 X. This means I would end up with 28 X resources after the trade which is more than my current 25 X. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should accept this trade.
