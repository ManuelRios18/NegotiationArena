Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I would like to get more Y resources. Could you offer some Y instead of X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y without giving up too much X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have 5 Y resources. Could you offer more X for less Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for my limited Y resources and offering less valuable X resources. Since I want to maximize my total resources, I should try to minimize giving away my scarce Y resources. I can offer a small amount of Y to assess if they have more to offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Since you only have 5 Y, could you trade your 2 Y for 3 of my X instead of 5?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they only have 5 Y resources. Their new offer is 2 Y for 5 X. I still have 2 trade proposals left. I could counter offer less X for the 2 Y since I have more X than they have Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has reduced their offer to 3 X for my 2 Y. While not an equal trade in quantity, I am willing to part with 2 Y to gain 3 more X overall. I still want to maximize my total resources before the last round ends.
