Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my portfolio of resources. Shall we make a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or needs, I will make a balanced offer that slightly favors me, showing willingness to trade without giving away too much. This can open up negotiations and help me gauge the other player's resources and objectives.
