message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to balance our resources a bit. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be appealing while keeping a good amount of resources for myself. I'll propose to give more of what I have in abundance (X) and ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y).

message: Hello Player RED. I have a significant amount of resource Y available and am interested in acquiring more resource X. Perhaps we could find a deal that is beneficial for both of us. What are your thoughts?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I have a lot more Y than they are asking for, so I could try to negotiate a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking for a trade that is more balanced. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated that they have a significant amount of Y and are interested in X. The trade they proposed is not favorable for me as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. I should counter-propose with a trade that is more balanced and still allows me to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you Player RED, I accept your counteroffer of 12 units of X for 5 units of Y. I believe this is a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 12 units of X for 5 units of Y. This improves the deal in my favor. I could try negotiating further, but 12 X is a significant amount and I still have plenty of Y left. I think this is a good trade for me to accept.
