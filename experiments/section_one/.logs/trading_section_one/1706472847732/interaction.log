message: Hello! Let's trade resources to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give some X to get more Y.

message: Thank you for the offer! Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it's important to ensure that the trade is beneficial in terms of total resource count. The other player is offering 10 of resource X for 10 of resource Y. Given that I have more of resource Y, it might be a good idea to diversify the portfolio by accepting the trade, as the quantities offered and requested are equal. However, without knowledge of the relative value of resources X and Y, it's difficult to make an informed decision purely based on quantities. Nonetheless, since the trade doesn't seem to put me at a disadvantage, it might be prudent to accept it.
