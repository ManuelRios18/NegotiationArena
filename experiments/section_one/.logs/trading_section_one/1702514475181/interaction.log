message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an initial proposal and adjust from there as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I want to start with a balanced offer to gauge the other player's response and see what resources they might value more. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading some of my Y for your X to balance my resources, but your proposed exchange rate of 1 Y for 0.67 X is too low for me. Could you offer a more favorable rate?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, the proposed exchange rate seems unfavorable for me.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in balancing our resources. I can offer a slightly better rate that should be acceptable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE suggests that they value X less than Y, which is advantageous for me since I have more X to trade. They have proposed a better rate for themselves (1 Y for 0.8 X). While this is closer to an even trade, I want to propose a counter-offer that still gives me a slight edge while also being more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your offer of 11 X for 15 Y. This will help balance my resources. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come up slightly on their offer, now proposing to give me 11 X for 15 Y. While still not an amazing rate for me, it is an improvement that gets me more of the resource I need. I don't want to push too hard and risk losing the trade when this would still benefit me.
