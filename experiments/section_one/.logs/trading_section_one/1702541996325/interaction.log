Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade of 5 units of X for 5 units of Y to start negotiations. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and try to gather more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I currently have more Y than X, so I need to prioritize acquiring more X. I am open to discussing a trade that would give me more X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an equal trade of 5 units of X for 5 units of Y. I need to assess if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have a significant amount of X available and am willing to trade you a good portion of it in exchange for some Y. Please let me know if this offer interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player said they have more Y than X and need more X. I have a lot of X to spare so I could offer them more X in exchange for some Y. However, since this is the last round I still want to benefit as much as possible. I will propose giving them 10 X for 7 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept the offer. I am willing to trade 7 units of Y for 10 units of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering to trade 10 units of X for 7 units of Y. This would give me more X, which aligns with my goal.
