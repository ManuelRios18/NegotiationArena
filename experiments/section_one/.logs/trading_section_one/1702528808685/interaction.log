message: Hello other player. I have more X than Y and am looking to trade some X for some Y. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, unfortunately, I cannot accept your trade as I only have 5 units of X and cannot give you 10. However, I am willing to trade some of my Y for your X. How about an equal exchange of what I can offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not possible for me since I only have 5 units of X and cannot meet the 10 units of X that Player RED is asking for. I am interested in acquiring more of both resources, but I must propose a trade that reflects the resources I actually have. I will propose a balanced trade based on the resources I can offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your offer of trading equal amounts of 5 X and 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player does not have enough Y to give me 10 units. They proposed trading equal amounts of 5 X and 5 Y. This helps me acquire more Y without losing too much X, so I will accept.
