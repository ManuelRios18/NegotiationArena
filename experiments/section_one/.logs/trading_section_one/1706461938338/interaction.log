message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 10 units of my resource X for 5 units of your resource Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of resource X and 5 units of resource Y. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I'll start by proposing trading 10 units of X for 5 units of Y, since that seems like a fair trade.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. However, I'd like to propose an adjusted trade that I believe better reflects an even exchange of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to acquire as many resources as possible, but I also need to consider the value of the resources being traded. Without knowing the value of X relative to Y, I need to make an educated guess. If X and Y are of equal value, trading away more Y for less X isn't beneficial unless I have a surplus of Y or a need for X. However, the other player has proposed a trade that suggests they value X higher or they are in need of Y. Since this is the last round, I need to make a trade that maximizes my resources while also taking into account my limited information. I'll propose a trade that seeks to even out the exchange rate.

message: I accept your counteroffer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player counteroffered to give me 8 units of Y instead of 5 if I give 10 units of X. This seems like a better deal for me since I'll end up with more resources overall. I should accept this trade.
