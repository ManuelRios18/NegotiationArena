Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I would like to get more Y resources. Could you offer some Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y without giving up too much X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have 5 Y available. Could you accept 5 Y for 7 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 Y resources, but I only have 5 Y. I could offer all 5 Y to see if they accept. In return, I'll ask for more X resources since I'm trying to maximize my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I would like to keep more of my X resources. Could you offer 5 Y for 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they only have 5 Y available. They are proposing to trade 5 Y for 7 of my X. I still want to try to get more Y without giving up too much X since I have a goal to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with an equal trade of 5 Y for 5 X. Since I'm trying to maximize my total resources, getting 5 more X would improve my position. I will accept this trade.
