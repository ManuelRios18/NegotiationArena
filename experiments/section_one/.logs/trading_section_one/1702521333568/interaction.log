message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make this last round count. I propose the following trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, my strategy will be to propose a trade that appears fair and beneficial to the other player while keeping in mind that I want to end up with more resources. I will start with a proposal that gives me a good amount of X and a few of Y, assuming that Player BLUE might also be looking for a balanced trade. I don't want to show all my cards in the initial proposal so that I have room to negotiate and improve the deal in my favor if needed.

message: Hello Player RED. I have a good amount of resource Y available. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 1 Y in exchange for 8 X and 3 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to get more X. However, I think I could try to negotiate a better deal since I have a lot of Y to offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I see you have a surplus of Y. I would like to make a counter-proposal that I believe is more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not favorable for me since I would be giving up a significant amount of resource X while only gaining a small amount of it, which is against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, knowing that Player BLUE has a good amount of resource Y, I can try to capitalize on that without losing too much of my X resource. I will counter-propose a trade that is more balanced in terms of X and leverages Player BLUE's abundance of Y.

message: Hello again Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating further. Getting more X would help me, but I don't want to lose too much Y either. Could you do 9 X for the 8 Y? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8 | Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 7 X and 2 Y in exchange for 5 X and 8 Y from me. This means I would gain 2 more X overall, while losing 6 Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I think I can try to get a few more X without giving up too much more Y.

message: Player BLUE, your offer seems fair. I am willing to accept this trade. Thank you for the negotiation, and may this trade be beneficial for us both!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is more favorable to me than the previous one. By accepting this trade, I will be gaining a net of 4 units of Y while losing only 4 units of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and given that this is the last round of trading, it might be wise to accept this trade as it increases my total resource count. Accepting this trade would give me a final tally of 21 X and 9 Y, which is a net gain of 4 resources.
