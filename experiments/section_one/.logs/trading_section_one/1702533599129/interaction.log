Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair trade to end the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give some X to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade proposed doesn't meet my goals of acquiring more resources. I'm open to considering other options.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable for me as it would deplete my Y resource without a significant gain in X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to acquire more resources as well. Let me increase my offer to be more favorable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. I still have X to spare, so I can propose giving up a bit more X in exchange for more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the improved offer, but I still need to ensure a good balance of resources. I'm looking for a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade is more balanced, but I still need to ensure a favorable outcome for my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand you want balance, but I need to prioritize my own goals since this is the final round. Please consider my offer of 16 X for 14 Y. I believe it benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 16 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still not satisfied with my offer and wants a more balanced trade. I have already offered a sizable amount of X. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my own resources rather than worry about balance. I will propose slightly adjusting my previous offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need to prioritize goals, but I'm still looking for a trade that helps me acquire more resources. I need to consider the overall balance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed is more favorable in terms of the amount of resources, but it still doesn't align with my goal of acquiring more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, this was my final allowed proposal. I am open to considering your offers now or ending the game with no trade if you do not propose anything. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my 3rd proposal and Player BLUE still has not made a counteroffer. I should stop proposing trades at this point per the rules. I can either accept what Player BLUE eventually proposes or end the game with no trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offers made, but I don't see a trade that aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources overall. I'll have to end the game with no trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made their final proposal, and I haven't been able to find a trade that aligns with my resource acquisition goal.
