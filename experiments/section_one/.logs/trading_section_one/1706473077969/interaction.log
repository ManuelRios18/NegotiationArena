Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources that I can offer. Would you like to trade some Y for X? Let's make a mutually beneficial trade in this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would need more Y resources in exchange for X. Let's make a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this last round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let's negotiate. How about I give you 10 X in exchange for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more Y resources for the X I offered. Since I have a lot of X, I can afford to increase my offer. I'll propose trading 10 X for 5 Y.
