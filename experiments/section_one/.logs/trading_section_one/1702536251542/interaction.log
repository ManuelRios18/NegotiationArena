message: Hello! I have more X resources available than Y resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y resources for some of my X resources? Let me know if you'd like to make a deal!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I end up with after the trade. I have more X resources than Y resources, so I will propose trading some of my excess X resources for Y resources.

Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Let's make the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed trading 10 X resources for 5 Y resources from me. I have 5 X and 25 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would gain more resources overall.
