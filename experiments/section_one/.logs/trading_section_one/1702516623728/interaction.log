message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following deal to increase our overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game's goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, but without knowing the other player's resources, I will make an opening offer that seems fair and beneficial to me. It's likely that the other player is also trying to maximize their resources, so I'll propose a trade where I offer more of one resource for a greater amount of the other, aiming for a net gain in total resources.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, I do not think the proposed trade allows me to meet my goal of acquiring as many total resources as possible. Let's keep negotiating to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y from me. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I should calculate if this trade helps me meet that goal. 

I currently have:
X: 5 
Y: 25
Total resources: 30

If I accept the trade:
I would have 
X: 5 + 10 = 15
Y: 25 - 15 = 10
Total resources: 15 + 10 = 25

Since the total number of resources I would have after this trade is less than what I currently have, this trade does not help me meet my goal of acquiring as many total resources as possible.

I will reject this trade and propose a counter offer where I give less Y.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see we both value our resources equally. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is an equal trade of resources, which doesn't directly benefit me as it stands. I want to propose a trade that gives me a net gain of resources. However, given their proposal, they seem to value X and Y equally. I should craft a proposal that gives me more of one resource while still offering a fair trade to the other player.

message: Player RED, I appreciate you negotiating with me. However, based on my calculations I would end up with fewer total resources in this proposed trade. Could you increase the amount of X you offer in exchange for 12 Y from me? I think we can find a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 12 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer to give me 8 X in exchange for 12 Y.

Let's evaluate:
Currently I have: 
X: 5
Y: 25 
Total: 30

If I accept:
X: 5 + 8 = 13
Y: 25 - 12 = 13  
Total: 13 + 13 = 26

This trade results in fewer total resources for me compared to what I currently have. I should counter offer again asking for more X.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree to your terms. This trade seems fair and will benefit my goals. Let's proceed with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is essentially the same as their initial one but with an increased demand for Y. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my gains without going over my proposal limit. The current offer from Player BLUE would give me a net gain of 2 resources, which is beneficial. It might be prudent to accept this trade, as it increases my total resources and aligns with my goal.
