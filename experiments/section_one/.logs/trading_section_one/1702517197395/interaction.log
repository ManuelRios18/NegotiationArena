Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in making a trade that benefits us both. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, I should aim to make a proposal that is beneficial to me while also being enticing enough for the other player to consider. I do not have information about Player BLUE's resources, so I will make an initial balanced offer that shows willingness to trade but also leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to prioritize acquiring more X at the moment. Do you have any X resources to offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than X, so I should prioritize acquiring more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. I understand your need for X resources. I am willing to offer you some of my X in exchange for Y. Let's find a balance that works for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a need for X resources. I can use this information to propose a trade that prioritizes giving away some of my X resources while acquiring more Y resources, which I have fewer of. I should make an offer that is appealing to Player BLUE but still leaves me with a good amount of X, as it seems to be a valuable resource.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The offer is more balanced, but I'm still evaluating my options. I'll get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade seems more balanced now, but I still need to consider if it's the best option for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need to make the right decision. Let's finalize a trade that we both feel good about. As this is the last round of trading, I'm willing to make a final offer that I hope you will find acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be considering the trade but is still hesitant. Since this is the final round, I might need to make a slightly more attractive offer to ensure a trade happens. However, I should also be careful not to propose a trade that is too favorable to Player BLUE and leaves me with fewer resources than I started with. I will make a final offer that increases the amount of Y I receive while still providing a good amount of X to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: This offer seems fair, and it will help me balance my resources better. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer seems quite favorable as it will help me balance my resources.
