message: Hello other player. I am proposing we exchange some resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you would be interested in a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a conservative offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer. However, I am looking to increase my total number of resources, not just exchange them. Could we adjust the trade so that it is more beneficial to both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is equal in terms of numbers, but without knowing the value of X and Y relative to each other, I have to consider the proportion of my resources this trade involves. I am giving up 20% of my Y while only receiving an equal amount of X, which doesn't increase my total number of resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should counter with a trade that increases my total count or maintains it while balancing the types of resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to increase total resources. Here is a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more resources from me while offering less in return. However, they want to increase their total number of resources. I could counter offer by increasing my side of the trade as well, so we both end up with more.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. This trade works for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED offers a total of 11 units of resources for 10 units of my Y. This is a net gain of 1 resource unit, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources from 30 to 31. It's beneficial to accept this trade since it's the last round and it will increase my overall resources.
