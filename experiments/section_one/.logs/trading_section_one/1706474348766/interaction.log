Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you'd like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see if that gets accepted or countered.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading but your proposed exchange rate seems unbalanced to me. Could you offer some more X for my Y? Or perhaps we could find another trade that benefits us both. Let me know if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 3 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, giving up 3 units of Y for only 5 units of X may not be a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can increase my offer of X if you can also increase the Y you provide. Could we do 8 X for 5 Y instead? Let me know if that works for you or if you have another trade in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered my original offer and wants me to give more X for the same 3 Y. I still don't know how many resources they have, but I could offer a bit more X since I have a lot. However, I don't want to give up too much without getting more Y in return. I'll counter back asking for more Y if I'm giving more X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 8 X for 5 Y. This trade will benefit us both. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 8 X for 5 Y. This seems like a fairer trade ratio. While I would be giving up more Y, I would get more X to balance out my resources. Since this is the last round, getting more total resources is my goal.
