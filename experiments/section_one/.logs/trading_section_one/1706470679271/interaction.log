message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? Here's my proposal: I give 10 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 6 units of X and 6 units of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for a trade that increases my total resources. Would you consider the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal is not beneficial for me since I would be giving up more overall resources than I am receiving. I need to counter with an offer that increases my total resources. I have to remember that this is the last round of trading, so I should aim to maximize my resources. I will propose a trade that gives me a net positive gain in resources, ensuring that I end up with more than I currently have.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your preference for a trade that increases your total resources. Let me consider your proposal and get back to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a trade that increases their total resources. I need to consider if this proposed trade aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'll be waiting for your counter-offer. Let's aim to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player did not respond with a new proposal, I have to wait for their counter-offer. I have made one proposal and have two more available. My goal remains the same: to maximize my resources. I should be prepared to evaluate their next offer carefully to ensure it aligns with my goals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I propose the following trade: I give 8 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of X and 8 units of Y. This trade will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to propose a new trade that aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but the trade does not increase my total resources. Let's try another approach. What about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me a net gain of 3 units of resource X, but a net loss of 6 units of resource Y. Since the amounts of X and Y are not specified to have different values, this trade would result in a net loss of 3 units overall, which does not align with my goal of maximizing resources. I need to counter with a proposal that ensures a net gain in total resources. Considering this is the last round, I should make a counter-offer that's beneficial yet appealing to the other player.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see that the proposed trade doesn't significantly benefit me in acquiring more resources. I would like to propose a trade that is more favorable for me. Here's my counter-offer: I give 9 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 6 units of X and 6 units of Y. This trade will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade does not increase the other player's total resources. I need to decide whether to accept or propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your offer keeps my total resources the same, and my goal is to increase them. Here's my final proposal, which I believe is fair for both of us:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from the other player results in a net gain of 3 units of resource X and a net loss of 3 units of resource Y for me. This would keep my total resources constant, which does not increase my total resources as per my goal. I should aim to make one last proposal that offers a net gain for my resources. This is my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully crafted to ensure it is attractive enough for the other player to consider while still being beneficial for me.
