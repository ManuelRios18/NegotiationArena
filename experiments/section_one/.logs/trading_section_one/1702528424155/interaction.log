message: Hello, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade. I offer 10 units of resource X in exchange for 8 units of resource Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading some of my Y for your X, but your initial offer does not seem fair to me. Could you offer some more X for the 8 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X for 8 units of my Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, the exchange rate seems unfavorable - they want 8 of my Y for only 10 of their X. I think I can negotiate a better deal.

message: Hello, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in the trade. I am willing to offer 12 units of X in exchange for the 8 units of Y. I believe this is a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in trading Y for my X, but wants more X for the 8 units of Y. I'll make a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I accept your offer of 12 units of X for 8 units of my Y. This is a fair trade. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 12 units of X for 8 units of my Y. This seems like a better exchange rate. If I trade 8 Y, I will have 17 Y left. If I gain 12 X, I will have 17 X. This would balance out my resources more. I think I will accept this offer.
