message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade. I offer 10 units of X in exchange for 7 units of Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: This trade seems fair to me. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers me more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for resource Y, of which I have a larger amount. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I should aim to maximize the total number of resources I have while keeping a balanced portfolio. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources from 30 to 33 and diversify my holdings, which aligns with my goal.
