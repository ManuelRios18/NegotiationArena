message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know the other player's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing a fair trade by exchanging X: 5 for X: 5. This trade doesn't change the overall balance of resources.
