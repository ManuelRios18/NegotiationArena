Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. I propose giving you some of my abundant resource in exchange for a smaller quantity of your resource. If you have a preference, let me know, and we can adjust the trade accordingly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, I want to make a strong initial proposal that benefits me but also seems fair to the other player. Since I don't know their resources, I'll propose a trade that offers a higher amount of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of my scarce resource (Y). This way, I can increase my total resources and potentially reach my goal.
