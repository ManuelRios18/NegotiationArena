message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Without knowing your specific needs, I would like to offer a trade that might benefit us both. I am willing to offer resources that could balance our inventories. Let's start with a proposal, and feel free to counter if it doesn't meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources or goals, I must craft a proposal that is enticing enough to be considered but still beneficial to me. I want to increase my overall resource count, ideally without knowing what the other player values. I'll propose a trade that offers more Y than X since I have a surplus of X and Y is less abundant.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but am going to pass for now. I would be interested in a trade that allows me to gain more X without losing Y. Please let me know if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 1 Y in exchange for 5 X and 3 Y from me. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would give me a net gain of 5 X but a loss of 2 Y. Given that I have more Y than X, I think it's better for me to hold onto my Y and try to gain more X.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking to increase your X without losing Y. I'm willing to make an offer that reflects that. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in acquiring more of resource X without losing any Y. Since I have a surplus of X, I can offer them X in exchange for some of their Y resources. This will help me meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible while providing them with the X resources they desire. I must be careful not to give away too much X in relation to what I receive in Y to maintain a beneficial trade.
