message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what the other player is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. This trade seems fair and beneficial to both of us. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposition is favorable as it allows me to balance my resources while still retaining a surplus of Y. Accepting would give me an equal amount of each resource, which could be beneficial for future trades or utility. Since this is the last round, maximizing the total number of resources is crucial, and this trade does not reduce my total count.
