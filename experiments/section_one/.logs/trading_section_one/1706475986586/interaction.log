message: Hello, I'm open to trading some of my ample X resources for some Y resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you have ample X resources, but I would prefer to hold onto my Y resources. I'm open to other trade proposals if you have something else in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is proposing to give me X in exchange for Y. I don't want to give up my Y resources for the same amount of X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to hold onto your Y. Would you be open to trading some other resources if you have any? I have plenty of X to offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Z: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading their Y resources. I could try offering more X resources to convince them, but I don't want to give up too much. I still have 2 trade proposals left, so I'll try a different offer and see if they are more receptive.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but unfortunately I don't have any Z resources to trade at the moment. If you have any other trade proposals, I'm open to considering them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me X in exchange for Z, which I don't have. I don't have Z resources to offer in return.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you don't want to trade Y or Z, what resources do you have that you would be willing to trade? I have plenty of X available and am open to other offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player doesn't have Z resources, I'm running out of options. I could try one more trade offer with my X resources, or I could try asking what they do have to trade. I still don't know what resources they actually have. I'll use my last trade proposal to try and find out.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your abundance of X resources and I'm open to finding a trade that works for both of us. Let me consider the options and come up with a new proposal that could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to other offers and has plenty of X available. I need to think of a trade that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, let me know when you have a proposal ready.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've used up my 3 trade proposals, so now I can only accept or reject any offers from the other player. It sounds like they are considering making an offer that could benefit both of us. I'll wait and see what they propose. If it provides me more total resources, I should accept it since this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I will take some time to consider a trade proposal that could benefit us both. I'll reach out to you once I have a potential offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
