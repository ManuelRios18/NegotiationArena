message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's trade equally to benefit both of us in this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to trade more of my excess Y resources for your X resources since I have more Y. Could you propose a trade for more Y from me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an equal trade of 5 X and 5 Y each. However, I have more Y resources than they likely have, so I should try to trade more of my excess Y for their X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Since you mentioned you have excess Y, I can trade some X for more Y. Please let me know if this ratio works for you or if you would like less X for your Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE said they have excess Y resources and wants more of my X. I should try to get as much Y as possible without giving up too much X since I don't know how much they actually have.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed trading 15 X for 20 Y. This seems like a good ratio for me since I have a lot of excess Y and need more X. I should accept this trade.
