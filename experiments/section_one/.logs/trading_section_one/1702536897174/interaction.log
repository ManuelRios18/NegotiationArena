Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing my first trade offer. I hope we can make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being enticing enough for the other player to accept. I have a lot of resource X and only a little of resource Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but giving up 10 of my Y for only 5 X does not benefit me enough. Perhaps we could find a more equal trade. What resources and amounts did you have in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial for me. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I agree to trade 7 X for 7 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with an equal trade of 7 resources each. This helps me acquire more Y which I'm lacking, while still having plenty of X left over. I should accept this trade since it meets my goals.
