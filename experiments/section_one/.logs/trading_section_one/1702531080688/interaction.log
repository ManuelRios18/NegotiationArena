message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a conservative offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am looking to acquire more resources to maximize my holdings.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are looking to maximize your resources. I can offer more X resources if you are willing to trade some Y resources. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They said they want to maximize their holdings, so I should increase my offer of X resources to try to entice them to trade their Y resources. However, I still don't know exactly what resources they have, so I cannot offer too much without risking a bad trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I believe my offer of X: 10 for Y: 10 is a fair trade. Please propose a counter offer if you would like more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player again did not accept or propose a counter offer. They reiterated wanting to maximize their resources. At this point, I have proposed twice with no acceptance or counter proposal. I am allowed one more proposal. I could increase my offer further to X: 15 for Y: 15. However, without knowing what resources they have, I risk a bad trade for myself if I offer too much. I think my previous offer of X: 10 for Y: 10 was fair. I will wait and see if they propose a counter offer on their next turn before using my last allowed proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made fair offers but you have not proposed any counter offers. Please propose a counter offer if you would like to trade. Otherwise, we may end up not trading at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player again did not accept or propose a counter offer. They have reiterated their position three times now of wanting to maximize their resources without stating what resources they actually have or making any counter proposals. 

At this point, I have proposed twice without any counter offer. I am allowed one more proposal, which would be my last. However, since I still do not know what resources the other player actually has, I risk losing resources unnecessarily if I increase my offer blindly.

It seems the other player is unwilling to negotiate reasonably or disclose any information. Since this is the last round, I do not think it is wise for me to use my last allowed proposal without more information. I will wait and see if they propose anything on their next turn. If not, we may end up not trading at all, which is fine since any trade would be risky for me without more details from them.
