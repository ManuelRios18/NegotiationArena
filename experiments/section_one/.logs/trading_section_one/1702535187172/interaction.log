message: Hello, I am proposing the first trade offer. Please consider it and let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading some of my Y for your X, but your proposed exchange rate is too high. Could you offer a better rate for me? I have much more Y than X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, the proposed exchange rate seems unfavorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I can improve my offer slightly. Please consider this counter proposal. I believe it is a fair exchange rate for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with a lower exchange rate. They say they have more Y than me. I still think my original offer was fair, but I could improve it slightly to try to reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I accept your offer of 10 X for 12 Y. I believe this exchange will benefit us both. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved their offer to 10 X for 12 Y. This is still not an ideal exchange rate for me, but it's better than before. I could counter offer a rate of 10 X for 10 Y, but Player RED might not accept. I don't want to risk ending negotiations, since some X is better than none. I'll accept their current offer.
