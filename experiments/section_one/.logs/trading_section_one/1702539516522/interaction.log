message: Hello, shall we trade some resources? I propose an equal trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and try to gain more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thank you for the offer. To make things more interesting, how about we trade different resources? I propose the following trade to diversify our holdings.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal trade of the same resource, which doesn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will propose a trade that allows me to gain an advantage by receiving more resources than I am giving away, keeping in mind that I can only propose a maximum of three trades.

message: I'm interested in diversifying resources, but your offer leaves me with none of resource Y. Could you provide some more Y to make it more fair?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 5 X and 10 Y from me for 15 Y from them. This would leave me with 20 X and 0 Y, while they would have 5 X and 15 Y. I'm unsure if this is an equal trade since I don't know their total resources. I could counter offer by asking for more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair deal. Let's proceed with this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is more balanced and still allows me to increase my total resource count. By accepting this trade, I would give away 10 units of Y and receive 5 units of X and 5 units of Y in return, effectively gaining 5 units of X for a net increase of 5 total resources. This is aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
