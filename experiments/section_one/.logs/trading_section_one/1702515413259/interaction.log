Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start the negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I am aiming to acquire as many resources as possible and I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations, showing willingness to trade but not revealing any urgency or specific need for either resource.
