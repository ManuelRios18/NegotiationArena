message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading, so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept or counter offer, which will give me more information.
