message: Hello, I am proposing we exchange some resources. Please let me know if you are interested in trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading but your offer of 5 Y for 5 X does not benefit me much since I already have a lot of Y. Could you offer more X for less Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I have a lot more Y than they are asking for, so I can try to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give you 8 X for the 3 Y. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and countered with asking for 10 X for only 3 Y. This suggests they have a lot more Y than I do and are looking to gain more X. While I'd prefer not to give up that much X, getting some additional Y would still help me. I'll see if I can negotiate the terms more in my favor.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 8 X for 3 Y. This is better for me since I get more X without giving up too much Y. Since this is the last round, I should accept a good trade while I can.
