message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we both aim to maximize our resources, let's start with a fair trade. Please consider my offer and feel free to propose a counteroffer if it doesn't meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I don't have any information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly, as is typical in initial trade negotiations. This initial proposal will help me gauge the other player's resource situation and willingness to trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I will consider the trade carefully and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is giving up 15 units of Y in exchange for 10 units of X. This would mean losing some Y, which I currently have more of, in exchange for X. I need to carefully consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for considering the trade. I await your counteroffer or thoughts on how we can make a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not made a counteroffer, so I still don't have information about their resources or preferences. Since this is the last round and I have a maximum of three proposals, I will wait for their next move before making another proposal. It's important to not use up my proposals too quickly without gaining any new information.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm still evaluating the potential trade and considering how we can both benefit from an exchange. I will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to a counteroffer. I need to carefully consider the trade and how it aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of careful consideration. Please let me know your thoughts or any trade ideas you might have when you're ready.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not providing any information or a counteroffer, which makes it difficult to proceed with a trade. Since this is the last round and I've already made one proposal, I will hold off on making another proposal until I receive more information that could inform my next offer. I must be cautious to not exhaust my limited proposals without gaining insight into the other player's position.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your patience. I am still evaluating the trade and considering potential options. I will get back to you once I have made a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is waiting for my response. I need to make a decision on whether to accept, propose a counteroffer, or continue to evaluate the trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand that finding the right trade can take time. Do let me know if there are specific resources you are looking for or if there is a particular ratio that would work for you. I am open to negotiation and want to ensure we both leave this trade satisfied.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to be non-committal and has not provided any information or a counteroffer. Given that this is the last round, and that I have two proposals remaining, I may consider making another offer to encourage a response. However, I also need to be mindful that without additional details on the other player's resources or needs, any proposal I make is a shot in the dark. Since the other player seems to be stalling, they might be waiting for me to make a concession or reveal more about my resources. It might be strategic to wait for their next move, bearing in mind that I only have two proposals left.
