message: Hello, I am proposing the following trade offer to acquire more resources. Please consider it and let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. I can part with some Y in order to gain more total resources with your X. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. I have plenty of Y to spare and getting more X would help me acquire more overall resources.
