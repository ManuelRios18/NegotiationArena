Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing that we each trade 5 of our resource X. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading, so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept or counter propose.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources instead of trading them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 of resource X doesn't benefit me as it doesn't increase my total resources. I need to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are looking to build up resources. I have a lot of X available and am interested in acquiring more Y. Would you trade 10 of your Y for 15 of my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in an equal trade and wants to acquire more resources. Since my goal is to acquire resources, I will propose trading some of my abundant resource X for their scarce resource Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking to increase my overall resources. I need a trade that will give me a net increase.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 10 of Y for 15 of X would decrease my Y resources and increase my X resources, but it doesn't significantly increase my total resources. I need a trade that increases my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can offer up to 20 units of X. Would you trade 15 units of your resources for 20 units of my X? This allows us both to end up with more total resources. Please let me know if we can make a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made clear they are only interested in trades that net them more total resources. I still don't know what resources they have available. I will propose trading more of my abundant resource X in an attempt to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm still looking for a trade that will increase my overall resources. I need to find a trade that benefits both of us in that way.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 15 of Y for 20 of X would increase my X resources, but decrease my Y resources. This doesn't align with my goal of increasing my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have offered several trades aimed at mutual benefit and net resource gain, but it seems we are not able to find common ground. I am going to wait and see if you have a new offer for our final round here. Please let me know if you have any ideas, otherwise we may need to conclude without a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have made 3 trade proposals now without the other player proposing anything in return. They are clearly trying to maximize their resources while revealing little information. I only have resources to give and they seem unwilling to trade unless I overpay. I should accept that we likely will not find common ground at this point.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of finding a mutually beneficial trade. I'll take some time to consider and come up with a final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have to be careful with my final proposal. I need to make sure it benefits my goal of acquiring more resources.
