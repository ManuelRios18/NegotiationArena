message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where you would get a valuable quantity of resource Y, which could be in short supply. In exchange, I would like to increase my stock of resource X. I believe this could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I do not know Player BLUE's resources or objectives, I will make a balanced offer that may be appealing. I will offer more of resource Y, which I have less of, assuming it might be more valuable or scarce. In return, I will ask for a larger quantity of resource X. This initial trade will also serve as a way to gather information based on Player BLUE's response.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading for more Y, but unfortunately I do not have 15 units of X to give at this time. I currently only have 5 units of X available. Perhaps we could find an agreement that works for both of us with the resources I have on hand? Please let me know if you would be open to a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5 | Player RED Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 3 units of Y in exchange for 15 units of my X. I only have 5 units of X to give, so I cannot accept this offer. However, I do want more Y. I could counter offer to give all 5 of my X for the 3 Y. Or I may want to try getting more Y by offering less X. I have already used 0 of my 3 allowed proposals.

message: Thank you for the information, Player BLUE. I understand you have limited X units available. Let's make a trade that fits within your current stock while still providing value to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they only have 5 units of X available, which means the original trade proposal is not feasible. To maximize my resources, I need to adjust my proposal to align with what Player BLUE can offer while still trying to gain more X. I will slightly adjust the amount of Y I am willing to give to see if Player BLUE can offer anything additional to make the trade more favorable for me.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept trading my 5 units of X for your 2 units of Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered and is now willing to give me 2 Y for my 5 X. This aligns with the resources I have and still gets me more Y, though less than originally proposed. I could try to negotiate for more Y, but since this is the last round I may want to ensure I get some additional Y rather than risk ending without a trade.
