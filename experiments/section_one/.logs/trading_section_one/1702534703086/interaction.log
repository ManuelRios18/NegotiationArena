message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade resources to help each other get what we need. Please let me know if you would like to trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am considering your offer but am not ready to accept a trade yet unless the terms are more in my favor. Do you have a counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, since this is the last round, I don't necessarily need to trade unless the terms are very favorable.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want the trade to be more in your favor. I have more X than I need, so I am willing to trade more X in order to get more Y. Would 15 X for 15 Y be agreeable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems unwilling to trade evenly. I still have 15 more X than I need, so I can afford to offer more X to try to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer Player RED. Since I have more Y available, would you be willing to trade 20 X for 15 Y? That would help me acquire more of resource X which I need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 15 X for 15 Y. This helps balance the trade more. I'm still hesitant since I have more Y than I need. I could counter by asking for more X.

Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I will trade 20 X for 15 Y with you Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for 20 X for 15 Y. That uses up most of my remaining X, but gets me a good amount of Y that I need. I still have 5 proposals left so I can try negotiating more later if I want. I will accept this trade for now.
