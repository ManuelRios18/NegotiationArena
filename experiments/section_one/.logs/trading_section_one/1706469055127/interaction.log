message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. However, as this is the last round, I would like to propose a trade that reflects the resources I currently have in excess. How about we make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair but slightly favors me, as I have no information about the other player's resources. A balanced trade would involve exchanging equal amounts of different resources. I will offer more of my abundant resource, X, in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, which I have less of, aiming to maintain a good overall balance.

message: Hello Player RED. I am unsure about the relative values between X and Y. Could you provide some information to help me evaluate if giving 3 Y for 10 X is a fair trade for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I'm not sure if giving away 3 Y is worth 10 X since I don't know the relative values.

message: Hello Player BLUE. In general, the value of resources can be subjective and often depends on the quantities each player has or needs. In my case, I find Y slightly more valuable due to its scarcity, which is why I proposed giving more X for less Y. I believe this trade could be beneficial for both of us since it allows for an increase in the diversity of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is looking for more information to assess the fairness of the trade, I should offer some insight without disclosing the exact number of resources I have. I can indicate that I value Y slightly higher than X due to my lower quantity of Y, which can justify the trade ratio I proposed. This may help convince the other player without giving them too much leverage for counter-proposals.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the insight on the values. I agree that trading some Y for X could be beneficial for both of us. Would you consider 10 X for 2 Y instead of 3 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED explained that Y is more valuable due to scarcity. Since I have a lot more Y than X, it makes sense to trade some Y for X to diversify my resources. I could counter offer 2 Y for 10 X since I still want to hold onto my Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I believe this trade is fair and aligns with my goal of increasing my resources. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE suggests trading 10 of my X for 2 of their Y, which is a decrease from my initial offer. Since my goal is to maximize resources and this is the last round, I should consider accepting the trade as it still aligns with my goal of increasing my Y resources. Additionally, I have a surplus of X and this trade would leave me with a substantial amount, allowing me to achieve greater overall resource quantity.
