message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am looking to acquire more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X if you are willing to give me more Y in return. Please make a counteroffer if interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or counter my initial offer. They said they want to acquire more resources overall. I still don't know what resources they have. I could increase my offer of X to try to entice them to trade more Y. But I shouldn't offer too much X without getting much in return since I only have 3 trade proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am still aiming to acquire more resources overall. I would be interested in a trade that gives me more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am interested in trading, but cannot offer much more without a counterproposal from you. Please propose a trade you think would work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player still did not make a counteroffer. They seem to be focused on acquiring the most resources possible. I could offer more X, but I am running out of proposals and don't want to give too much without knowing what the other player has. At this point, it may be best to wait for them to propose a trade since they want more resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. I will propose a trade that could work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 8 X for 8 Y. This helps me acquire more Y while still retaining a good amount of X. And I still have 1 trade proposal left if needed. Overall it moves me closer to my goal of acquiring the most resources possible.
