message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade that I believe would be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would result in a net loss of resources for me. I would be giving away 6 units (4X + 2Y) and receiving only 6 units (5X + 1Y) in return. Considering my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, I should either propose a trade that gives me a net gain or at least breaks even. I have not used any of my three proposals, so I will propose a trade that is advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE gives me more Y, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. I will accept the trade.
