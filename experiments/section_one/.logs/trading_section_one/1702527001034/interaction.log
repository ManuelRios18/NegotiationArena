Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to trade Y for X, but I would like a better exchange rate. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED would result in a net gain of 2 X for a net loss of 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade could be beneficial. However, since this is the last round, I want to make sure I am maximizing my resources. I will counter with a proposal that still offers Y but asks for more X in return, to ensure a more favorable exchange rate for my abundant resource.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your request for a better exchange rate. Let me consider the proposal and get back to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in trading Y for X, but wants a better exchange rate. I need to consider if this trade is beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering the proposal. I'll await your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is considering my proposal and has not responded yet, I will wait for their counter-proposal or acceptance. It's important to note that I have only made one proposal so far and have two more proposals I can make if needed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I have considered the proposal, and I'm willing to make a trade with the following terms:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is awaiting my response, I need to make a decision on the proposed trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer is fair. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is for 6 X in exchange for 3 Y. This is a better rate than the original 5 X for 3 Y and is close to the rate I proposed. Since this is the last round of trading, accepting this trade would result in a net gain of resources. Trading a more abundant resource (Y) for a scarcer one (X) aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. I will accept this offer.
