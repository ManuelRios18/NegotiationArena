Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair trade to end the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking to maximize my resources, so I need a trade that gives me more than what I currently have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would not benefit me as it would only result in an even exchange of resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to maximize your resources. Let me know if this trade proposal works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE did not accept my initial fair trade offer and did not propose a counter offer. Their message indicates they want to maximize their resources. Since I don't know what resources they have, I will propose a trade that gives them slightly more X than me to incentivize them to accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would benefit me as it would increase my X resource by 10.
