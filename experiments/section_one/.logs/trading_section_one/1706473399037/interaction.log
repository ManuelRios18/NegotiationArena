message: Hello, I am proposing we start trading to see if we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing a small trade to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering to trade X for Y. I want to keep my resources balanced, so I'll reject this trade and propose a new one.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer but proposed an alternative that is more favorable to them. I could accept to complete the trade, or try negotiating further. Since this is the last round, I don't want to risk the other player walking away, so I will accept their offer.
