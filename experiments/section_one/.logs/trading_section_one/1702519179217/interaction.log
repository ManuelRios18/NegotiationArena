message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources and I'm open to a fair trade. Let's work something out that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, I want to propose a trade that is beneficial for me but also appealing to the other player, without knowing their resources or goals. I will start with a modest trade offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the offer, but I need to prioritize acquiring more resources. Let's see if we can come up with a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is interesting, but I need to consider my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your response! I understand we both want to maximize our resources. Perhaps we can agree on a trade where the total number of resources increases for both of us. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept the initial offer and did not propose a counter-offer, indicating they may be looking for a more enticing deal. Since this is the last round, I should propose a trade that is still favorable to me but more generous to ensure a deal is made. I need to be cautious not to give away too much as the goal is to maximize resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial trade. I need to prioritize gaining more resources. Let's see if we can come up with a trade that allows both of us to gain more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal seems reasonable, but I need to ensure that I'm gaining more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to increase your total resources. Let's try this proposal: I give you a larger amount of my X resources, and in return, I receive a proportionate amount of your Y resources. This should increase our total resources and be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still looking for a trade that allows for an increase in their total resources. Since they have not made a specific counter-offer, I need to propose a trade that is clearly beneficial for both sides while still adhering to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Itâ€™s important to propose a trade that increases both of our total amounts of resources to make the offer appealing.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see the potential for a mutually beneficial trade here. However, I need to ensure that I'm gaining a significant amount of resources. Let's see if we can come up with a trade that allows both of us to gain more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade could be beneficial in increasing the overall resources, but I need to ensure that I'm gaining a significant amount in return.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the importance of a significant gain. Here's my final offer, which should be very appealing to you, while also allowing me to increase my resource pool. Let's finalize a trade that helps us both end on a high note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not yet accepted any offers and continues to emphasize the need for a significant gain in resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a final proposal that is more generous to ensure a trade goes through, while still increasing my total resource count. This will be my third and final proposal, so it needs to be carefully considered.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I think we can both benefit from this trade. I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last opportunity to propose a trade. The new offer seems favorable in terms of increasing my resources.
