message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start the trade with an offer that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in trading my Y resources right now, but could offer more X if you reduce the Y you're asking for.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than the other player is offering, so I don't want to give up my Y. I could counteroffer more X for less Y.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let's try to find a balance that works for both of us. How about this revised trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to offer more X if I reduce the Y I'm asking for. I need to consider if it's worth increasing the X I'm giving up in exchange for more X.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has increased the amount of X they are offering while keeping the Y cost the same. This seems like a better deal for me.
