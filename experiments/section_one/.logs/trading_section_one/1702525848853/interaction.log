message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from exchanging resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the goal is to maximize resources, I should consider the value of X relative to Y. If I trade away 3 Y for 5 X, I am gaining resources overall, which aligns with my goal. However, I want to make sure I'm getting the best possible deal. I don't have information on the other player's resources, so I can't assess the relative scarcity. Nonetheless, since this is the last round, I should make a decision that ensures a net gain. Accepting this trade seems reasonable as it gives me a net gain of 2 resources.
