message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's work towards a deal that's mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts on the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair and beneficial to both parties without knowing the other player's resources. I will start with a balanced trade that might interest the other player while also increasing my resources.

message: Hello Player RED. Unfortunately your proposed trade does not match my goal of acquiring more resources, since you are asking for more from me than you are offering. Let's try to find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing that I give up more resources than they are offering. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not benefit me.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I see your point, and I would like to propose another trade that could work for both of us. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I need to counter with a proposal that would increase my total resources while also being attractive to Player BLUE. I should aim to give less than I receive, but keep the trade fair and appealing.

message: Hello again Player RED. I appreciate your new offer, but you are still asking for more resources from me than you are willing to give. Could we find a deal where we exchange equal amounts? That seems fairest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade offer from Player RED is better, but still asks me to give up more resources than they offer. I will try to negotiate a more equal trade.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of a fair trade. However, I am looking to make a deal that will slightly increase my total resources. Here's another proposal that might work for us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is for an equal exchange, which does not help me reach my goal of acquiring more resources. I should aim to propose a trade that appears balanced but slightly favors me to maximize my gains.

message: Hello Player RED. I can agree to trade 5 of my X resources and 4 of my Y resources in exchange for 4 of your X resources and 4 of your Y resources. This achieves my goal of increasing my total resources. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with an offer that is closer to equal, but still asks for 1 more X resource from me. I could accept losing 1 X resource if it means ending the negotiations and making a deal.
