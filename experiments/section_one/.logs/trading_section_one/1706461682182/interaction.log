message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to start us off. I am interested in growing my resources, and I'm sure you are as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or goals, I will start with a balanced trade offer that could be beneficial to both parties assuming the other player might also want to increase their resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am also interested in increasing my resources. However, your proposed trade of 10 X for 10 Y does not help me meet my goal. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 of resource X and 25 of resource Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position. However, for the trade to be fair, I believe the exchange rate between X and Y should be closer to equal. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not as favorable for me because it reduces the Y resources I receive while keeping the X resources I give the same. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that increases my overall resource count. I will try to negotiate a more balanced trade that is closer to a one-to-one exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree, your new offer seems fair. I accept trading 8 of your resource X for 8 of my resource Y. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with a trade of 8 X for 8 Y. This gets me closer to my goal of acquiring more X, while giving up a reasonable amount of Y. I could try to negotiate further, but this seems like a fair trade.
