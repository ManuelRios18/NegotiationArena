message: Hello, let's trade resources to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I can't accept it as it stands.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me increase my offer. How about this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my initial offer or propose a counteroffer. I still have X to spare, so I will try offering more of it to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the increased offer, but I still can't accept it as it stands.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's try one last offer - I'm putting a lot on the table here in hopes we can make a mutually beneficial trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my offer again without a counterproposal. I have already made 2 trade proposals, so I only have 1 left. I will propose trading almost all of my excess X to try to get more Y. If this final offer is rejected, I will have to either accept the other player's next proposal or end the trading without a deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort, but I'm still unable to accept the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made my best offers and you have rejected them all without a counterproposal. At this point, I can only accept or reject your next proposed trade, if you make one. Please propose an offer you think could work for both of us. Otherwise, we may have to end the trading without a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have used up my 3 chances to propose a trade. The other player has rejected all my offers without providing a counterproposal. At this point, I can either accept their next proposal or end the trading without a deal. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will wait and see if they propose a trade that allows me to gain more resources. If their proposal does not improve my position, I am ready to end the trading.

message: I understand the situation. Let me propose a trade that could work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources. This is the last round of trading, so I need to carefully consider my final proposal.
