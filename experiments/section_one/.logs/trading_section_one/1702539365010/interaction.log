message: Hello, since this is the final round, let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade. I have more X than Y, how about trading some X for some Y? Please propose an offer you think could work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Thank you for the offer, I agree to an even trade. This has been a great game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the final round, I need to make sure the trade is beneficial for me. The other player has offered to trade evenly, 5 of their X for 5 of my Y. Given that I have more Y than X, and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade. Accepting this trade would increase the variety of my resources while keeping the total count the same, which aligns with my goals.
