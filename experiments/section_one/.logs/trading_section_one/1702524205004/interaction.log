message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? I am open to different offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade offer works for me. Let's make the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 3 Y in exchange for 8 X and 5 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 more X and 2 less Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me.
