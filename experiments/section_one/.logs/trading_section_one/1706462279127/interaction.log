message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit one another before the last round ends. Please let me know if you would like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X resources for 3 Y resources and see if that is accepted or countered.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your offer seems unbalanced. Could you propose something more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 3 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, 3 units of Y for 5 units of X seems unbalanced in Player RED's favor.

message: I accept your counter offer of me giving 3 X resources for 2 Y resources from you. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and countered with trading 3 X resources for 2 Y resources. This seems more balanced since I have more X resources. I will accept their offer so we can both benefit before the last round ends.
