Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to try to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Yes, I can accept trading 3 of my Y resources for 5 of your X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, so giving up 3 Y to get 5 X seems like a good trade for me. Since more resources are always better and this is the last round, I should accept trades that give me more total resources.
