message: Hello, I'm proposing we make a trade. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could propose trading some of those for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm not interested in trading 5 Y for 5 X. Do you have any other offers?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering 5 X for 5 Y. I can afford to trade 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about this offer instead:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: My initial offer was rejected. Since I don't know how many resources the other player has, I'll increase my offer to try to make it more appealing. I can afford to trade more X resources if it means getting more Y in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can't accept the new offer as it would leave me with no X. Is there a different trade you can propose?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is to trade 10 X for 10 Y. This would leave me with 15 Y and no X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Okay, let's try this then:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player needs to keep some X resources. I'll propose a trade for less X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I can't accept the new offer as it would leave me with no X. Is there a different trade you can propose?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is to trade 5 X for 7 Y. This would leave me with 18 Y and no X.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need to keep some X. I cannot make any more trade proposals. Please let me know if you have an offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has reiterated that they need to keep some X resources. I've already made my 3 trade proposals, so I cannot propose anything further. I will wait and see if they make an offer instead.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I need to keep some X for my goals, so I can't accept the previous offers. I'll accept the trade of 10 X for 10 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player cannot make any more trade proposals. I need to make a decision based on the available offers.
