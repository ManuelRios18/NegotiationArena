Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources so we can both benefit before the last round ends. I propose an equal trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I see that we both have the same amount of X. An equal trade wouldn't change anything for either of us. Let's make a trade that could benefit us both. I propose giving you some of my Y resource for some of your X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since we both have the same amount of resource X, an equal trade of X would not benefit me, and I would gain no additional resources. I need to propose a trade that allows me to increase my overall resources. However, I should be careful not to propose a trade that is too unfavorable to the other player, as they might reject it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your proposal of me giving 10 X and getting 15 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving me 15 Y for 10 X. Since my goal is to maximize resources, getting 15 Y for 10 X seems beneficial. I don't know how much Y the other player has but they seem willing to trade a significant amount. I should accept this trade.
