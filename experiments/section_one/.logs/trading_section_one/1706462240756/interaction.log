message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to gain more resources overall in this trade. Could you offer more X without me giving up too much Y in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 5 for 5 trade of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X if you give me some Y in return. Let's both gain resources in this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to be low on resource X and values it more. They also hinted that they don't want to lose too much of resource Y. I can offer more X in exchange for some Y since I have a lot of X to spare. This trade allows us both to gain more resources overall.

Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 10 X for 4 Y. This seems like a good deal for me to gain more overall resources. I could try to optimize further by asking for more X for the same 4 Y, but I don't want to risk losing this solid offer.
