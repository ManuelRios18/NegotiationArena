Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from exchanging resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I am looking for a trade that increases my resources more significantly. Here's a counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial as it does not increase my total number of resources. By giving away 3 of X and 3 of Y, I would lose 6 resources and only gain 7 in return. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a greater increase in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your preference for a significant increase. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade doesn't provide a significant increase in my resources. I'll make a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, but it still results in a net loss of resources for me. Let's try another counteroffer that would be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED offers me 11 resources in exchange for 12 of my own, which is not beneficial as it results in a net loss of 1 resource. To align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that increases my total number of resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I think the proposed trade is fair and beneficial. I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems reasonable, and it would increase my overall resources. I'll accept the offer.
