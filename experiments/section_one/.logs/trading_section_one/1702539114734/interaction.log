message: Hello, let's trade resources. I have more X than Y. Would you trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I think we can make a better deal. I would like to propose a counter-offer that reflects the value of our resources better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to get a favorable trade. Although the other player is offering 5 X for 3 Y, I have no information about their resources, and I might be able to get a better deal. I should propose a counter-offer that gives me a larger net gain of resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-offer. Let's trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and countered with asking for 10 X for only 3 Y. That seems unfair based on my current resources. I could try negotiating the terms further or making a different offer. However, since this is the last round, I don't want to risk the other player ending negotiations. I'll accept their offer for now to guarantee I get some additional Y, even if I have to give up more X than I'd like.
