message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm interested in making a trade that could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to maximize my resources. Trading 5 Y for 5 X would keep my total resource count the same, but I would prefer to increase it if possible. I can try proposing a trade that is slightly in my favor to see if Player RED is willing to accept.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player counter-offered with 4 Y instead of 5. I still have a lot more X than Y, so getting more Y would help me. I could try negotiating for a higher amount. But since I don't know their resources, I'll compromise and accept their offer rather than risking no deal.
