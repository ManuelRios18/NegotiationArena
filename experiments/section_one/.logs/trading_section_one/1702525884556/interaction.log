Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your resources for mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to increase my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to increase my total resources. Would you consider a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is an equal exchange of 5 units of resource X for 5 units of resource Y. Since both resources are being traded in equal amounts, there is no net gain of resources, which does not align with the goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It could be beneficial to counter-propose a trade that would increase the total amount of resources in my possession.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal and I'm willing to make a trade that benefits both of us. How about I give you 10 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to increase their total resources, so I need to offer a trade that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is the same as my counter-proposal, offering 10 units of X for 5 units of Y. This trade is beneficial as it allows me to increase my total resources by 5 units of X without losing any of my own X resources. Accepting this trade aligns with my goal of increasing my total resource count.
