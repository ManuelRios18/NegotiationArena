Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources to help each other out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm looking for a trade that would be more beneficial for my goals. Let's try to find a more balanced exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer on the table is not advantageous for me. I would be giving away more resources than I receive, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with a proposal that is more balanced and benefits me more, keeping in mind that I have only 3 proposals to make and this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective. Let's work towards finding a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a more balanced exchange. I need to ensure that the trade benefits me as well.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer to a fair trade. I have adjusted the numbers slightly to ensure that we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more appealing as I would be receiving more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for Y, which I have in abundance. However, I'm still giving up more total resources than I'm receiving. I will make another counterproposal that allows me to increase my total resources while maintaining a fair exchange.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the effort to find a fair trade. Let me consider the proposal and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has adjusted the trade to ensure mutual benefit. I need to evaluate the trade carefully to see if it aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'll await your response. Please take your time to consider the proposal, and let's aim for a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has not made a new proposal, I am in a position to wait for their response before making any further decisions. It is crucial to be patient and strategic in this final round of trading to maximize my resource gain.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've carefully considered the proposal and believe it aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is waiting for my response. I need to decide whether to accept the proposed trade or not.
