message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, and more resources in general is better, this trade would help me acquire more resources overall.
