Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade for 5 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and the other player proposed an even trade for 5 X. I can accept this trade as it won't affect my current X resource.
