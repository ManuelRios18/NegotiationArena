Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit from it.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I currently have more Y resources than what you offered. Could you let me know how many X and Y resources you have available so we can try to work out a fair trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than the other player is offering, so I could propose trading some of my Y for their X. However, since I don't know how many resources they actually have, I'll start by asking for more information first.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y available for trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is requesting information about my available resources. I will share that information to see if we can work out a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for letting me know what you have available. Here is a trade offer: Player BLUE gives Y: 10 | Player RED gives X: 10. This allows us both to gain some of the resource we have less of. Let me know if you'd be interested in that trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that I know the other player has 25 X and 5 Y, I can propose a trade that benefits both of us. I'll offer 10 of my Y resources for 10 of their X resources. This allows us both to gain resources we are short on.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can aim for a trade that allows me to acquire more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered a trade to balance our resources. I need to consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted. I look forward to exchanging resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with an offer of 8 X and 2 Y for 10 of my Y. This allows them to gain more resources overall. However, since my goal is to maximize resources, I would be better off accepting this trade. Gaining 8 more X is worth giving up 10 Y.
