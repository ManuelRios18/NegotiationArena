message: Hello, I have more X than Y. Would you trade 1Y for 2X? Let me know if you're interested or would like to propose something else.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can get. I have a lot more X than Y. I could offer some X in exchange for Y. But I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer for 2X for 1Y to see if they are interested.

message: That trade works for me. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a lot more Y than X. Trading 1Y for 2X seems fair and gets me more total resources. Since this is the last round, I should accept.
