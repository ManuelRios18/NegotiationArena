message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources. Would you be willing to trade some Y resources for X? Let's start with a small trade and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could propose trading some of those for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

message: That works for me. Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since I have plenty of Y and getting more resources in general is good, this seems like a good trade to accept.
