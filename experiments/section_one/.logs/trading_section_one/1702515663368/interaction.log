message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that could benefit us both. Shall we start with an offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I should aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to accept. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial to both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently have less X than Y. What is your resource distribution? Perhaps we could find a trade ratio that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, I'm not sure if a 1:1 ratio is fair since I don't know Player RED's resource amounts.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your openness. I currently have 25 of resource X and 5 of resource Y. It seems we have opposite resource distributions. I propose we find a ratio that could equalize our holdings a bit more. Would you be open to trading some of your Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has indicated they have less X than Y and have asked about my resource distribution, it might be beneficial to share this information to build trust and potentially reach a mutually beneficial trade. Given that I have more X than Y, there is an opportunity for a trade that could address both our resource imbalances.

message: Thank you for the fair trade offer Player RED. I accept! This will help us both achieve more balanced resource distributions.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade of 15 of their X resources for 8 of my Y resources. After the trade, I would have 20 X and 17 Y, while Player RED would have 10 X and 13 Y. This helps balance our resources. I could propose a counter offer asking for more X, but since this is the last round I think I should accept this trade rather than risking no trade at all.
