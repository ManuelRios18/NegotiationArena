Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade 10 of X for 10 of Y since I don't know what resources you have. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer but I need to balance my resources. I can't afford to give up 10 Y at the moment, but I could consider a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a surplus of Y and a lower amount of X. I need to make sure I don't deplete my Y reserves while also increasing my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, balancing resources is important. How about I give you 5 X in exchange for 3 Y instead? Let me know if that could work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE said they need to balance their resources and can't give up 10 Y. I could offer less Y in exchange for X to see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would help me balance my resources without depleting my Y reserves too much. It's a fair offer.
