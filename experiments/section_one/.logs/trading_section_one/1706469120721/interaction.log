message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Without knowing your current resource situation, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial exchange!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowing the other player's resources, it's best to make a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources while still being potentially attractive to the other player. I will offer a balanced trade that could be appealing.

message: Hello Player RED. I have less X than I would like. I could use more of that resource. However, your proposed trade takes away more resources from me overall, so I cannot accept. Let's try to find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 12 X and 3 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could benefit more from getting more X. However, the proposed trade takes more resources away from me overall.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand you are looking for more of resource X. Let's find a trade that increases your X while keeping our overall resource exchange beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not advantageous for me as it results in a net loss of resources. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain, or at least an equal trade, while also addressing Player BLUE's desire for more of resource X.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade. By giving up some of my abundant Y resources, I can increase my amount of the scarcer X resource. This is beneficial for me and moves me closer to my goals. Thank you for working with me to find a mutually agreeable exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade, offering 15 X in exchange for 10 X and 4 Y from me. This allows me to gain 5 additional X while giving up 4 Y. Since I have more Y to spare, this trade helps me work towards my goal of acquiring more X overall.
