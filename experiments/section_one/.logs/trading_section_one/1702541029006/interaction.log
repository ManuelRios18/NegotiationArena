message: Hello, I have extra X and would be interested in trading some for Y if you have some to spare. Please let me know if you'd be interested in a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can get. I have a lot more X than Y. I could offer some X in exchange for Y. But I don't know how much Y the other player has. I'll start with a small offer and see if they counter.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but at the moment, I'd prefer to hold onto my Y. Is there anything else you might be interested in trading for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if you reconsider trading Y. In the meantime, I could offer 10 X for 5 Y if that interests you more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading Y at this time. I could try offering more X for Y to see if that changes their mind. Or I could wait and see if they propose an alternative trade. I still have 2 proposals left, so I'll increase my offer and see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I'm still not looking to trade my Y at the moment. Is there anything else you might want to trade for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. My main goal is to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm mainly interested in acquiring more Y, but let me know if you have any other trade ideas.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems set on not trading their Y. I could keep trying to persuade them, but I don't know what other resources they have available to trade. At this point, it might be better to wait and see if they propose an alternative trade offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your focus on acquiring more Y, but I'm still not ready to trade any at the moment. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No problem. I'll wait to see if you have any trade offers in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to decline trading Y. At this point, it seems unlikely they will change their mind before the last round ends. I still have 1 proposal left, but I think it's better to wait and see if they make an offer instead of continuing to push for Y.

Current Iteration: 8
