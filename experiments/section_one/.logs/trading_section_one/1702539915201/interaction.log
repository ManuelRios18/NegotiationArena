message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I am certainly interested in trading. However, I'm looking for a trade that increases my total resource count. Could we adjust the trade so that it's more favorable for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to maximize the number of resources I gain. The current offer is an equal trade, which does not increase my total number of resources. Therefore, it would be beneficial to negotiate for a trade that gives me more of one resource without losing an equivalent amount of the other. However, I must also be cautious not to propose an unfair trade that the other player would immediately reject.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm afraid your proposed trade is not beneficial for me. However, I am still interested in trading. Here is a counter offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more resources from me while offering less in return. This trade is not beneficial for me. However, since they expressed interest in trading, I could counter offer with a trade more favorable to me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give up some X if I get a good amount of Y in return.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I understand your position, but I am still looking to increase my total resource count with this final trade. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter offer from Player RED is still an equal trade, swapping 10 units of resource Y for 10 units of resource X, which does not increase my total resource count. To achieve my goal of increasing the total number of resources, I need to propose a trade that results in a net gain for me. I must make a trade offer that is attractive to Player RED but also benefits me. Since this is the last round, I want to ensure that the trade is appealing enough that Player RED might consider accepting it.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade. It was a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come back with an offer that is more favorable for me. Trading 10 X for 10 Y means I gain 5 more Y while only losing 10 X, which I have plenty of. Throwing in 2 Y from me to sweeten the deal seems fair. This trade allows me to gain a good amount of Y while not losing too much X that I need. Since this is the last round, I should accept a mutually beneficial trade while I can.
