message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed is a 1:1 exchange, which doesn't really benefit me. I would prefer to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let's try this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more resources than I offered. I have a lot of X to spare so I could offer more. But I also don't want to give up too much without getting a decent amount of Y in return. I'll increase my offer but still start relatively small.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm still looking for a trade that will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is giving me more X in exchange for Y, which is not in line with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's try this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to be holding out for a better offer. I could increase my offer again, but I'm getting close to my limit of proposals. I'll make one more increased offer, but if they reject again, I'll have to consider accepting whatever they counter-propose.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking for a trade that will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is giving me more X in exchange for Y, which is not aligning with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I unfortunately cannot make any more trade proposals. Please let me know if you have an offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've made 3 trade offers now with no counter-offer from the other player. Based on the rules, I cannot make any more proposals. My only options now are to accept their offer if they make one, or continue rejecting. I still want to try to get more Y resources if possible, so I will wait and see if they propose a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand. I'm still focused on acquiring more resources, so I'll wait to see if you have any other offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have to be careful here, as this is my last chance to propose a trade. I still want to acquire more resources.
