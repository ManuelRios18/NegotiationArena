message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair trade to end the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to have a fair trade as well, but I think we could find an even better balance. Let me know what you think of my counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I have a lot more Y than Player RED likely has X based on them proposing 5, so I could ask for more.

message: That's a fair trade, I accept. Thank you for the good negotiation, Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is offering 10 Y for 10 X. Since I have a lot more X, this trade would benefit me by getting more Y which I have less of. I should accept this offer.
