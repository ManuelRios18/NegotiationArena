message: Hello! I am open to trading resources. Let's see if we can make a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! I am willing to trade, but would like to propose a slightly different exchange. I'm looking to increase my overall resources and would prefer to give away less of resource Y. Let's find a balance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, maximizing resources is crucial. The proposed trade from Player RED offers an equal exchange in terms of quantity, but without knowing the value or utility of resources X and Y, it is challenging to evaluate the fairness. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and I have a substantial amount of resource Y, I could consider offering a counter-proposal that still leaves me with a net gain in total resources. I will propose a trade where I give less of resource Y to maintain a higher total quantity of resources after the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted! I can agree to 5 Y resources in exchange for 5 X. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to give away less Y resources. I still have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to adjust my request for Y downwards. Getting some additional Y resources would still benefit me.
