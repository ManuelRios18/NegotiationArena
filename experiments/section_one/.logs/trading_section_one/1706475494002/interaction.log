message: Hello! I have a lot of resource X and am willing to trade some of it to get more resource Y. Please make an offer if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give up some X to gain more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see that you have a lot of resource X and are looking to trade for resource Y. I'm interested in making a trade, but I'd like to propose a different offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has a lot of resource X and is willing to trade for resource Y. I have a good amount of resource Y, so I could potentially benefit from this trade.

message: Deal accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed that I give 8 X for 15 Y. This is a better deal for me since I get more Y for less X given up. I should accept this trade.
