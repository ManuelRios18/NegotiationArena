Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have more X than I need and could use some more Y. Would you trade 5X for 3Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider my resources and goals before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5X and 25Y, and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no problem. Since I have a lot of extra X, I could trade up to 10X if you can spare some Y. What do you think about 10X for 5Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They may need more information about what I'm willing to trade before deciding. I still have excess X to trade, so I will make another offer proposing to trade even more X for Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the new offer, but I still need to carefully evaluate my resources and goals before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5X and 25Y, and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if you have a counter proposal after considering your resources and goals. I'm open to trading X for Y if we can find an offer that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not accepting or proposing a counter offer. At this point, I don't have enough information about their resources and what trade ratios they find acceptable. I have already made 2 trade proposals, so I cannot make more. I will wait and see if they propose a trade on their next turn before deciding whether to accept.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for being open to finding a mutually beneficial trade. I will consider a counter proposal that aligns with my resources and goals.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have reached my limit of trade proposals, so cannot offer anything else. Please let me know if you have a counter proposal that works for you on your next turn. If it aligns with my goals of maximizing resources, I am willing to accept. Otherwise we may have to end without a trade this round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player still has not proposed a counter offer or accepted one of mine. At this point I have reached my limit of 3 proposals. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my resources. If the other player proposes an offer on their next turn that gets me more Y without giving up too much X, I will accept it. Otherwise I will end without a trade.
