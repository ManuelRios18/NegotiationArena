Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my resources. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. Looking forward to a beneficial exchange!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't know the other player's resources, I need to make an initial fair offer to start the negotiation process. I will propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial to both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to maximize my overall resources. I'll need to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X but reduce my Y. I need to ensure I increase my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking to maximize your resources. I am willing to adjust the offer to come to an agreement that's mutually beneficial. Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not made a counteroffer, indicating they may be looking for a more advantageous trade for themselves. I should propose a new trade that is slightly more in my favor but still appears fair, as this is my second proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised proposal. However, I still need to focus on increasing my overall resources. I'll need to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised proposal gives me a small increase in X and a small decrease in Y. I still need to ensure I maximize my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: It's important for me to also increase my total number of resources. Let's aim for a trade that's balanced for both of us. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not making a counteroffer, which makes it difficult to gauge what they consider a favorable trade. I will make one final proposal that I find acceptable, keeping in mind that this is my last proposal before I can only accept or wait for the other player's offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the importance of balance, but I still need to focus on maximizing my overall resources. I'll need to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would reduce my Y without giving me any X in return. I need to ensure I increase my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Since I've reached my limit for proposals, I look forward to your offer and will consider it carefully to ensure it aligns with my goal to increase my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have now reached my limit of three proposals, and the other player has yet to make a counteroffer. At this point, I can no longer propose new trades and must decide between accepting an offer from the other player or ending the game without a trade. Since the other player is focused on maximizing their resources, they may be looking for an offer that is less favorable to me. I must be cautious and ready to either accept a fair deal or end the game without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding. I will carefully consider a trade that aligns with my goal of increasing overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to focus on maximizing my overall resources in this final trade.
