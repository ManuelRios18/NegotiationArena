message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. I propose the following offer to get us started. Please feel free to counter if you have other preferences.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or their goals, I will make a balanced offer that reflects a good faith trade, aiming to increase my resources while being fair to the other player.

message: Hello Player RED. I am also looking for a mutually beneficial trade, but your initial offer requires me to give up too much Y compared to the X I would receive. Let's continue negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to minimize the amount of Y I give up while maximizing the amount of X I gain.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concerns about the trade balance. Here's a new proposal that I believe could work for both of us, providing a more even exchange rate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is an equal exchange, but it doesn't increase the total amount of resources I have. I want to negotiate a trade that increases my total resources. I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me than the initial one but still offers Player BLUE a reasonable exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for improving your offer. I'm getting closer to a trade I'd accept, but the amount of Y you are asking is still more than I'd like to part with. Please make your best offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a new offer - 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. This improves the exchange rate slightly in my favor. However, I still think I could minimize my Y losses. I have room to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand we both want a fair trade. Here's my final offer, and I hope it meets your expectations for a balanced exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is again offering an equal exchange. To move the negotiation forward and aim to increase my total resources, I will make a final proposal that asks for slightly more Y than I am offering in X, but not as much as in my previous offer. This will be my third and final proposal, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your final offer as a fair trade. Let's complete the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a final offer of 10 units of X for 12 units of my Y. This improves the exchange rate slightly more in my favor compared to their previous offer. Since they said this is their final offer, I think I should accept it rather than trying to negotiate further and risk ending without a deal. 12 units of Y is an amount I'm willing to part with to get 10 more units of X.
