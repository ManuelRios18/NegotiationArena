message: Hello, would you be interested in making a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading 3 Y for 5 X at this time since I already have more X. Perhaps we could find another trade that is more fair. What other resources do you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

message: I have X and Y available for trade. What resources do you have and what trade would you consider fair?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not interested in the initial trade. I need to come up with a more balanced proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I also have access to resources X and Y. Since I already have a decent amount of Y, I would be interested in trading some of my excess Y for more X to balance out my resources. Would you consider trading 10 X for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has asked what resources I have and what trade I would consider fair. I have X and Y. Since I already have a lot of Y, gaining more X would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept the trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in trading 10 X for 5 Y. This trade would give me more Y, which aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.
