message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from exchanging resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not interested in giving away 5 of my limited X resources without getting any Y resources in return. However, I would be open to a trade where I get some Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 0, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 0
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, so I can afford to give away 5 Y. However, I only have 5 X resources, so I don't want to give any of those away unless I get some Y resources in return.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective. How about this trade instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in the initial trade, and they are open to a trade where they get some Y resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The player is now offering me 8 X resources, which is good since I only have 5 X. In exchange they want 3 Y resources, which I can spare from my 25 Y. This seems like a good deal for me.
