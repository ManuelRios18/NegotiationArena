Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than Y resources. Would you be willing to trade some of your Y resources for some of my X resources? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I also have an abundance of Y resources. Let's trade equal amounts of X and Y to help balance out our supplies.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they have more X than Y. Their proposed trade gives me 5 X for 5 Y. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, getting more X could be beneficial.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You have a lot of Y resources as well. I can offer more X if you are willing to trade more Y. Let's try to help each other gain more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE also has a lot of Y resources. Their proposed trade of 10 X for 10 Y is equal but won't give me more total resources. I can offer more X to try to get more Y since I have excess X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. This trade helps us both gain more overall resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 15 X for 10 Y. This seems like a good deal for me to get more total resources. I still have plenty of Y to spare.
