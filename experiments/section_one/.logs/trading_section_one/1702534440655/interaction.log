message: Hello! I have more X than Y. Would you trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y. I could offer some X in exchange for Y. But I don't know how much Y the other player has. I'll start with a small offer and see if they counter.

message: That trade works for me. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed trading 5 X for 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.
