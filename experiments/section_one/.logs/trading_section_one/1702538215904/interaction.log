message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

message: Greetings! I'm interested in trading, but I'd like to propose a slightly different trade to maximize benefits for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity; however, without knowledge of their resources, it's not possible to determine if this is the best trade. Since this is the last round and there's no penalty for proposing trades at this point, it might be beneficial to counter-propose to see if a more advantageous trade can be made. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I could attempt to propose a trade that gives me a larger quantity of resources in return for a reasonable amount of my own.

message: I would prefer to trade a smaller amount since this is the final round. Please let me know if you'd accept this counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 10 X for 10 Y. This is a better ratio for me since I have a lot more X than Y. However, trading away 10 X is a significant amount and since this is the last round, I want to maximize my total resources. I'll counter offer with a smaller amount.

message: Thank you for your offer. However, I'd like to suggest a different trade that might work better for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers a trade where I would give up more Y resources than I receive in X. Since our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not seem beneficial as it stands. I will propose a trade that is more advantageous to me, keeping the quantities small as suggested by Player RED while still trying to gain a net increase in resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of trading 6 X for 5 Y. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 6 X for 5 Y. This is very close to my last offer and seems fair. I'm willing to accept losing 6 X to gain 5 more Y since I have a lot more X. This will maximize my total resources for the last round.
