message: Hello! Let's trade some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 5 units of resource X in exchange for 5 units of resource Y. I want to maximize my resources, so I need to consider if this trade benefits me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, take your time considering. Here is another offer that may be more aligned with both of our goals:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or counter my initial offer. They seem to be taking time to consider if the trade helps them meet their goal. I could offer more X to potentially sweeten the deal. But I don't want to offer too much without knowing what resources they have available. I'll propose a slightly larger trade and see if that motivates them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. I'll need to evaluate if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is now offering 8 units of resource X in exchange for 8 units of resource Y. This trade seems more balanced, but I still need to assess if it benefits my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let me know if this revised trade offer works for you:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not countering or accepting. It seems they really want to maximize their resource gain. I could offer even more X, but I'm hesitant without knowing what resources they have. I still have one more trade proposal I can make. I'll try increasing the offer once more. If they don't accept after this, I may have to switch strategies.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has revised the offer to 10 units of resource X in exchange for 10 units of resource Y. This is a more favorable trade for me, as it allows me to acquire more resources.
