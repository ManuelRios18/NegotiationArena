message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my portfolio and would like to propose a friendly trade. I am willing to offer you a substantial amount of my X resources for some of your Y resources. I believe this could be mutually beneficial. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources or what they value, I want to start with a balanced offer that might appeal to them while ensuring that I do not give away too much of my resources. I will propose a trade where I offer more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a similar distribution of resources. This initial trade will help gauge Player BLUE's reaction and give me insight into their resource situation.
