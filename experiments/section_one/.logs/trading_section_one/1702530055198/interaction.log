message: Hello! I am proposing we start small to build some trust. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing a small trade to test the waters.

message: Greetings, Player RED! Thank you for your offer. I'm interested in a trade that could benefit us both more significantly. Would you consider the following counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is equal in quantity, and without knowledge of the other player's resources, it's difficult to assess the value. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to trade in a way that maximizes my total number of resources. I will counter with a trade that gives me more resources in total.

message: Hi there. I'm hesitant to trade 10 X resources without understanding what resources you have available and what your goals are in this game. Could you please share some information to help us find a mutually beneficial trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial small trade and countered with asking for more X resources from me. I still don't know how many resources they have. I could counter offer by asking for more Y resources from them, but since this is the last round I think I should try to learn more about what they have before proposing anything further.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello again, Player RED! I can share that I have a moderate amount of X and a larger surplus of Y. My goal is to increase my total resource pool. Could you offer a trade that would give me a net increase in resources? I'm open to suggestions and am looking for a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is seeking more information, which could be used to establish trust and potentially lead to a better trade for both of us. Sharing some information might encourage a more favorable trade, but I should be cautious not to reveal too much. I'll share that I have a moderate amount of X and a larger amount of Y without specifying the exact numbers.

Turn: 0
message: Since you have a surplus of Y resources, I can offer you some of my ample X resources in exchange. This should help us both end up with more resources total. Does this sound like a fair trade to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has a moderate amount of X and a larger surplus of Y. Their goal is to increase their total resource pool. Since I have a large amount of X, I could offer some of that in exchange for some of their surplus Y. This would increase both of our total resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED! This trade sounds fair and it will help me reach my goal of increasing my total resources. I am happy to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me a net increase of 5 resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for me. Since this is the last round of trading, it's important to maximize the trade's benefit.
