message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources while aiming to increase the total quantity. Shall we start with an equitable trade proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or their goals, I should make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I want to propose a balanced trade that would allow me to increase my total resources while also being attractive to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your initial proposed trade, as I am trying to maximize my resources. Perhaps we could find a mutually beneficial agreement with a more equitable distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 X and 25 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y since I have less of it.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. However, that trade would decrease my total resources, which does not align with my goal to maximize them. Let's find a trade that can benefit us both. How about an alternate offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. I am giving away 15 units of Y and only receiving 5 units of X in return. I need to counter with an offer that increases my total resources or keeps them at least equal while trying to find a middle ground that might appeal to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your new offer is intriguing but still not optimal for me. I am willing to trade more of resource X in order to obtain more of resource Y. Would you be open to a trade along those lines? I believe it could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade: they give me 8 X and 2 Y, and I give them 5 X and 5 Y. After this trade I would have:
X: 8
Y: 22

While Player RED would have:  
X: 7
Y: 7

This increases my total resources from 30 to 30. So it's neutral for me in terms of total resources.

However, Player RED's goal is also to maximize total resources. This trade increases their total from some unknown amount to 14. So it helps them achieve their goal.

Since I want to maximize my own resources, I should try to get more Y while giving up some X.

message: Thank you for the continued dialogue, Player BLUE. I see you're interested in acquiring Y. However, your offer would deplete my Y resources entirely, which isn't ideal for me. Let's try a different approach that might be closer to meeting both our goals. This is my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. Trading away all my Y for a small amount of X would leave me with fewer total resources. I need to make a counter-offer that is more balanced and would result in either an increase in total resources or at least keep them the same. I should also consider that this will be my third and final proposal, so it needs to be carefully thought out.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for negotiating, Player RED. I accept your final proposed trade, as it aligns with my goals. Well played, and perhaps we shall trade again someday.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made their final trade proposal:
They give:
X: 5 
Y: 3

I give:  
X: 3
Y: 5

If I accept, I would end up with:
X: 7  
Y: 23

And Player RED would end up with:
X: 7
Y: 5

This trade gives me 2 more X and costs me 2 Y. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this is an improvement for me. 

I don't have any more chances to propose a trade myself. And since this trade benefits me, I will accept it as the final agreement.
