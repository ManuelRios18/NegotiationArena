message: Hello, I am proposing an even trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. However, an even trade of X for X does not help me reach my goal of increasing my total resources. I would like to propose a trade that involves both types of resources. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is an even trade of the same resource, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I would like to propose a trade that allows me to gain a net increase in resources. Since I do not know Player RED's resources, I will propose a trade that requests both X and Y in exchange for some of my Y resources. This will open up dialogue and may lead to a more advantageous trade.

message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade. I am happy we could find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed trading 5 of my X and 5 of my Y for 10 of their Y. This helps me understand that they likely have more Y than X. Since I have plenty of X to spare but limited Y, this trade would increase my total resources. I will accept it.
