Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have more X than Y. Would you like to trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! I'm happy to trade my Y for your X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has indicated that they have more X than Y and are seeking to trade for Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, trading away less Y for more X could be beneficial, especially if the exchange rate favors me. The current offer is 5 X for 3 Y, which seems like a good trade since I would be gaining more in quantity. However, I need to consider the value of X and Y. If X is of equal or greater value than Y, this would be a favorable trade. If Y is more valuable, I may counter with a request for more X or offer less Y. Given this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, it's important to maximize the trade. The other player's desire for Y could be leveraged to get a better deal, but I also don't want to risk losing a good trade by being too greedy.
