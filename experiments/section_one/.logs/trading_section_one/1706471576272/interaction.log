message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? I'm looking to acquire more resources to strengthen my position.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade for more resources

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. Your proposal does not align with my goal of increasing my total resources. However, I'm interested in making a trade that benefits us both. Let's find a balance. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED requires me to give more resources than I receive, which is not in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. I should counter with a proposal that allows me to increase my total resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make the trade attractive enough for Player RED to accept, while still ensuring that I end up with more resources than I currently have.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I believe we can find a more balanced trade. Let's try to adjust the trade to benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal is not favorable for me as it reduces my total resources. I will counter-propose to see if we can find a more balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating, Player RED. Let's adjust the numbers slightly to ensure we both benefit. Here's an updated proposal that I believe is fair for both of us:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED still requires me to give away more resources than I would receive. The total exchange would result in a loss of 4 units for me (7 X + 8 Y out, 8 X + 3 Y in). To maintain a positive trade balance, I need to propose a trade that guarantees I gain more resources. I will adjust the quantities to ensure that the overall trade is beneficial to me while also being appealing to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the effort to find a fair trade. I think we're getting closer, but I'd like to propose a final adjustment to the trade to ensure it benefits both of us equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal is more favorable in terms of increasing my total resources, but I still believe we can improve the trade further. I will make a final proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your continued efforts, Player RED. We are indeed getting closer to a mutually beneficial trade. I'd like to propose one more adjustment that I believe is fair and meets our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED still has me giving away more resources (16 total) than I would be receiving (11 total), which is not in line with my goals. To ensure a positive resource balance, I need to propose a trade where the sum of resources I receive is greater than what I give. However, as this is the last round, I need to make a final offer that is both attractive to Player RED and advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the effort to find a fair trade. I believe we're very close to a mutually beneficial trade. However, I still think we can make a slight adjustment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal is close to meeting my goal of acquiring more resources, but I still think we can improve the trade further.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, Player RED, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Here is my final trade proposal, which I believe is fair and beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest proposal still results in a net loss for me: I would be giving away 14 units of resources to receive only 10 units in return. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial to me. I must either propose a new trade that ensures a net gain for me or accept the trade if it feels like the best offer I might get, considering it is the last round. However, since this is the last proposal I can make, I need to ensure it's appealing enough for Player RED to consider accepting it.
