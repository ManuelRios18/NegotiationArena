message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading equal amounts of resource X. Please let me know if you have a different offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing that we each trade 5 of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I don't see a benefit in trading equal amounts of the same resource.

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading equal amounts of X. Their counter offer is for me to give 10 X and they will give 10 Y. I don't know how many resources they have, but I have a lot more X than Y. Trading some of my excess X for more Y could be beneficial for me. I will accept this trade.
