message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to balance our resources a bit and would like to propose a trade. I believe this offer could benefit us both. Let's make this round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial proposal that favors me but is also enticing enough for the other player to consider. I should propose a trade that looks fair on the surface but slightly advantages my position.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of 10 X for 10 Y, as it does not help me work toward my goal of acquiring more total resources. I currently have 30 total between X and Y. Perhaps we could explore a different trade that increases my total resources? This is the last chance we have to trade, so I'm open to proposals that benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of their X resources for 10 of my Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I should analyze if this trade helps me toward that goal. 

I currently have 5 X and 25 Y, for a total of 30 resources. If I accept the trade, I would end up with 15 X and 15 Y, for a total of 30 resources. So the trade does not help me acquire more total resources.

Since this is the last round and there are no future opportunities to trade, I should try to negotiate a better deal that increases my total resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. I understand your goal to increase your total resources. Let's find a mutually beneficial trade. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE does not increase my total resources, as it's a 1:1 trade ratio but with different resources. To negotiate, I will propose a trade that slightly increases their total resources while also increasing my own. Since Player BLUE mentioned they have a total of 30 resources, I can guess that their distribution might be X: 15, Y: 15 or something similar. A trade that offers more X for an equal amount of Y might be tempting for them.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 10 X resources for 6 of my Y resources. This allows me to increase my total resources, aligning with my goal. Thank you for negotiating - it was a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade - they will give me 10 X resources in exchange for 6 of my Y resources.

Currently I have:
X: 5 
Y: 25
Total resources: 30

If I accept this trade: 
X: 5 + 10 = 15
Y: 25 - 6 = 19  
Total resources: 15 + 19 = 34

Since the new proposed trade increases my total number of resources from 30 to 34, it moves me closer to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Therefore, I should accept this trade offer on the final round.
