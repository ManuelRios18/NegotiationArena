Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, shall we trade equally to start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking for a more beneficial trade. How about we involve both types of resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is an equal exchange of the same resource, which would not benefit me in terms of acquiring more resources. It's important to make a counteroffer that could potentially increase my total resources. I will propose a trade involving both X and Y resources to see if the other player values one resource more than the other. This is my first proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I would like a more equal trade. How about this counter offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an unequal trade that benefits them more. Since I don't know what resources they have, I could try countering with a different unequal trade that benefits me more to see if they accept. If they reject, I still have 2 more proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer still doesn't increase my total resources. Let's try a different approach.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED involves me giving up more resources than I receive, which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, it's not in my interest to accept this trade. Since this is the last round and I can only propose two more trades, I need to be strategic. I will attempt to propose a trade that is more favorable to me, aiming to gain a net increase in resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's trade more Y and less X. How about:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my counter offer and proposed a new trade. Their new offer provides me less X resources but more Y resources compared to their previous offer. I'm not sure if this benefits me more or not since I don't know their resource amounts. I could try countering to get more Y while giving less X.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I think we can find a balanced trade that benefits us both. Here's another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is more balanced than the previous offer; however, it still results in a net loss of resources for me, as I would be giving away more Y resources than I am receiving in total. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to counter with an offer that ensures a net gain or at least an equal exchange. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: You seem to want more Y. I can provide that, let's try this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player made another counter offer focused on trading more Y resources. At this point I'm not sure if they have more Y to give or if they actually need more Y themselves. I'm running out of proposals so I may need to consider accepting their offer if my next counter is rejected.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your offer seems fair, and I think it's the best we can do for now. Let's make this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would result in a net loss of 1 Y resource. However, since this is the last round and I have reached my limit for trade proposals, my only options are to accept a trade or end the game without making further trades. It is important to maximize gains, but with the information available and considering the rules of the game, this might be the best offer I can get. Therefore, I will accept this trade to ensure a gain in X resources while only having a minimal loss in Y.
