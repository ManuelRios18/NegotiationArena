message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your resource Y for my resource X? I propose the following fair trade to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer that could be beneficial to both parties. I'll propose a trade where I offer more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y, aiming to increase my total resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in diversifying my resources as well. Your proposed trade seems fair. However, I would like to try to acquire even more X if possible, since I currently have less X than Y. What do you think about the following counter-offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a good trade for me to acquire more overall resources.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I am glad to see you're willing to trade. I would like to adjust the proposal slightly to ensure the trade remains balanced for both of us. How about the following trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer by Player BLUE is interesting, as it suggests they have fewer X resources than Y. It is also a 1:1 trade which seems fair on the surface. However, I need to be cautious not to deplete my X resources too much while maximizing overall gain. I will counter with a slightly adjusted proposal that still gives Player BLUE a good amount of X but keeps the trade beneficial for me.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 12 X for 4 Y. This is still a good trade for me since I get more X without giving up too much Y. I could try to negotiate further, but I think this is a fair deal.
