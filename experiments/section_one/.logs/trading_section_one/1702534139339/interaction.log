message: Hello, I have resources X and Y available for trade. Please let me know if you're interested in trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to give 5 X resources and ask for 10 Y resources in return. That seems like a reasonable trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I am interested in trading, but your proposed exchange rate seems unfair. Could you offer more units of X for less Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give up more X. How about 10 X for 7 Y? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a trade of 8 X for 5 Y. That exchange rate is better for them than my original offer. However, I still have a lot of X to spare, so I can afford to give up more. I'll counter offer 10 X for 7 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 10 X for 7 Y. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 10 units of X for 7 units of my Y. This seems like a fairer trade ratio. Since my goal is to acquire more resources, gaining more X would be beneficial as I currently have less X.
