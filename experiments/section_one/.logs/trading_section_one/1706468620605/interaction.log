message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose an equal-value trade to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start with a balanced proposal offering equal value from both sides to open negotiations. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll propose a trade that would be appealing if they had a higher demand for Y over X.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting negotiations, but I would prefer not to trade away my Y resources since I have more of those. Let's focus our trade on the X resource.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 10 X and 1 Y from them for 5 X and 5 Y from me. However, I have more Y than they likely do, so I don't want to give away my Y. I will counter by offering just X.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your preference to keep Y resources. Let's make a more balanced exchange of X resources, considering we both seem to value them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a preference for keeping their Y resources and focusing on X. The proposed trade is not in my favor as it would give away double the amount of X that I would receive. I will counter with a trade that is more balanced in terms of X and leaves out Y entirely, as per Player BLUE's preference.

message: Thank you, I accept your offer of 6 X for my 5 X. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED proposed trading 6 X for my 5 X. This seems like a fair and balanced trade that gets me more X without giving up my valuable Y. I will accept this offer.
