message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has so I will start with an even trade to try to gather some information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi there! An even exchange doesn't quite meet my goals. How about we mix it up a bit? I'm interested in diversifying my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange of the same resource, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should propose a trade that benefits me more, offering less valuable resources in exchange for more valuable ones. Since I have no knowledge of Player RED's resources, I'll propose a trade that's slightly in my favor, hoping they might need resource Y more than resource X. This will be my first proposal out of three allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I am interested in increasing my Y resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in acquiring my X resources and offering a higher quantity of Y resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, getting 10 Y for 5 X could be beneficial if I am low on Y. I will accept the trade.
