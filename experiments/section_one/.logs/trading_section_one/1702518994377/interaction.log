Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I propose a fair trade to optimize our resources. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a trade that seems fair but still advantageous to me. I do not know the other player's resources, so I will start with a balanced offer that could be attractive to the other player while giving me a profit in resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade proposal is interesting, but I need to ensure that any exchange aligns with my resource acquisition goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would increase my X resource but decrease my Y resource. I need to carefully consider the trade-off.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to align with your goals. Let's find a trade that benefits us both. Here's a revised proposal that might suit both of our interests better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not accepted my initial proposal nor have they made a counteroffer. Without knowing their resources, it's challenging to make an offer that will be accepted without sacrificing my own resource goals. However, since they are looking to align the trade with their resource acquisition goals, I could slightly adjust my proposal to make it more appealing, while still aiming to increase my net resource count. I have to make sure that this trade still benefits me and keeps the trade balanced from my perspective.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I believe this revised trade proposal is mutually beneficial and aligns with my resource acquisition goals. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised proposal increases my Y resource, which is beneficial for my goals.
