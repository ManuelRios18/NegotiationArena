message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Let me know if this interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Your offer is interesting, but I'd like to counter-propose: what if you give me 6 X and I give you 4 Y? This way, we both get a bit more of what we need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems fair, but I might be able to negotiate a better deal, especially since this is the last round of trading. I should propose a trade that slightly favors me to maximize my resources. I will attempt my first proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give you 6 X but would need 5 Y in return. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with getting 6 X for 4 Y. This is a bit more skewed in their favor than my original offer, but could still be worthwhile for me since I have a lot more X. I'll counter back to try to get the trade more balanced.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering my proposal. How about this: I give you 4 Y in exchange for the 6 X? This way we both benefit from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my total resources. The counter-offer is acceptable, but I should try to get the best possible deal. I'll make a second proposal, aiming to give away less Y while still getting 6 X, which is a good deal for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to trading with you again.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player came back with their original offer of 6 X for 4 Y. I still think 5 Y would be more fair, but 4 Y is better than nothing. Since this is the last round, it may be risky to keep negotiating and end up with no trade at all. I'll accept their offer so we both walk away with something.
