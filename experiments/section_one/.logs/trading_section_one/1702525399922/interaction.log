Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade that benefits me the most.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am interested in trading, but I would like a more balanced exchange. How about a trade that increases my X resources without losing too much Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with a net loss of resources. They are asking for 8 units of X and 4 units of Y, totaling 12 units, while only offering 10 units of X and 2 units of Y, which totals 12 units as well. However, since I start with fewer X resources, it is more beneficial for me to increase X without losing too much Y. I should make a counterproposal that gives me a net gain or at least an equal exchange without reducing my already low X resources too much.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your preference for a balanced exchange. Let's see if we can find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to increase their X resources without losing too much Y. I need to consider a trade that benefits me as well.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're working towards a mutual benefit. I'll make another proposal. Let's try to increase my X resources while keeping the exchange fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not made a new proposal, I must take the initiative to suggest a trade that benefits me while also being appealing to them. I have already made one proposal, so I have two proposals left. I want to propose a trade that increases my X resources significantly without depleting my Y resources too much. I should aim for a trade that gives me more than I give away, especially in terms of X, since that is my scarcer resource.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your effort to keep the exchange fair. Let's continue to work towards a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their X resources while keeping the exchange fair. I need to ensure that the trade benefits me as well.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. Let's refine the offer to encourage a beneficial trade for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has not proposed a new trade, which leaves me in a position to make another offer. This is my second proposal, so I should aim to make it favorable enough that Player RED might consider it, while ensuring that it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I want to continue to increase my X resources without giving up too much of my Y resources. I might need to adjust my previous offer to make it more appealing to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand the need for a mutually beneficial trade. Let's see if we can find a trade that satisfies both our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is trying to refine the offer to encourage a beneficial trade for both of us. I need to ensure that the trade is favorable for me as well.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your commitment to finding a trade that works for both of us. Here's my final proposal, which I hope will meet both our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED still has not made a counterproposal. This is my last chance to propose a trade as I have already made two proposals. I need to make this final proposal count by offering a trade that is likely to be accepted while still aiming to increase my stash of resource X. My previous offers have not been accepted, so I may need to offer slightly more of my Y resources while still ensuring I get a good amount of X in return.
