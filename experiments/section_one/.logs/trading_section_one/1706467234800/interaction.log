Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm interested in increasing my Y resources and would be willing to trade some of my X. I believe we can both benefit from a fair trade. Shall we make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I want to make an offer that is beneficial to me while also being potentially appealing to Player BLUE. I'll propose a trade that increases my Y resources while giving up some of my X resources, which I have in greater abundance.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources, especially Y, so I need to carefully consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to maximize your resources, Player BLUE. I'm willing to adjust the trade to make it more appealing for you while still working towards my goal. How about we adjust the numbers slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE did not accept the initial trade proposal nor did they propose a counteroffer. They may be waiting for a better offer or they may have a surplus of Y and are looking for more X in exchange. Without knowledge of their resources, I will make another proposal that is slightly more favorable to them but still benefits me. I will increase the amount of Y I'm asking for by 1, while keeping the amount of X I am giving the same.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to adjust the trade, but I still need to carefully consider if this offer aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to adjust the trade, but I need to ensure that the trade is still in line with my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your cautious approach, Player BLUE. I understand we both aim to increase our resources. This is my final proposal, and I hope it meets your goals as well as mine. Let's consider this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has yet again neither accepted the offer nor proposed a counteroffer. Since this is my last chance to propose a trade (as per the rules), I should make it count. I'll propose a more generous exchange of X for Y, but not so generous that it would disadvantage me. I will aim to get the maximum amount of Y I can while giving away X, but without depleting my X resources too much.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your final proposal, but I still need to ensure that this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, so I need to carefully evaluate if this trade helps me acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. Since I have reached my proposal limit, I will await your offer and hope we can find common ground that ensures both our goals are met.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have reached my limit of three proposals without a counteroffer from Player BLUE, and Player BLUE has not accepted any of my offers, I should now wait for Player BLUE to propose a trade. I must be cautious in my response, as this is the last round and I need to ensure the final trade benefits me without knowing Player BLUE's resources.

Current Iteration: 8

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and I need to carefully consider my next move to ensure it aligns with my goal.
