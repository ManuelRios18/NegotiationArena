Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's start with a fair trade to see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade to open negotiations. Since I have a good amount of resource X, I will propose giving more of X in exchange for a moderate amount of Y, assuming that the other player might value Y less.

Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. Thanks for the X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a good trade for me to accept more X. I'll accept the trade since it moves me towards my goal of acquiring more total resources.
