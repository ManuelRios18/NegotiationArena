Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Looking forward to a beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer that benefits me but could also be appealing to the other player. I will offer less of my more abundant resource in exchange for more of their potentially less abundant one. This is my first proposal, so I have two more chances to adjust based on the other player's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade proposed is not favorable for me. I would need a more balanced trade to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I am giving away more resources than I am receiving.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. I understand the need for balance. Let's try a new approach that might be more agreeable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my initial offer and is looking for a more balanced trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a new trade that is more even yet still favorable to me. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more opportunity to propose a trade if this one is not accepted.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The new proposal is getting closer to a balanced trade, but I still need to consider the distribution of resources carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is a step in the right direction, but I still need to ensure that I am not giving away too much of my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to work towards a fair trade. Here is my final proposal, which I believe should meet our mutual interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still looking for a better trade but is acknowledging that we are getting closer to a fair exchange. For my final proposal, I must offer a trade that is likely to be accepted but still allows me to gain resources favorably. I'll adjust the amounts slightly in the hopes of reaching an agreement without further negotiation options on my end.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: The proposed trade is acceptable to me. I agree to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is more balanced, and I would benefit from acquiring more resources.
