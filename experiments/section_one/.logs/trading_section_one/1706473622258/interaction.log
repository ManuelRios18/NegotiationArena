message: Hello other player. I have extra X resources available. Would you trade 5 Y resources for 5 of my X resources? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose trades that benefit me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to give 5 X resources in exchange for 5 Y resources and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have enough X resources and I want to maximize my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let's trade more resources then. How about I give you 10 of my X resources in exchange for 7 of your Y resources? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to acquire more resources overall, so I should increase my offer. I have a lot of X to spare, so I can offer more. I'll propose giving 10 X in exchange for 7 Y. This allows me to gain more Y while still giving the other player a good amount of X.
