message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you'd be interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know how much you're looking for. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to want to gain total resources rather than trade between resource types. I could offer more X in exchange for some Y while still keeping an advantage. I'll propose a trade for 10 X for 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand, acquiring more resources is always good. Here is my last offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems focused on gaining total resources. My next proposal will be my last allowed. I could offer a sizable amount of X for a small amount of Y, since I have a lot more X. This might incentivize them to trade while still allowing me to gain some Y.

message: I'm out of trade proposals. Please let me know if you have an offer, otherwise I'm open to waiting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'm out of trade proposals at this point. The other player seems focused on gaining total resources and has not shown interest in trading between resource types. Since this is the last round, I should accept any trade from them that gets me more Y, even if I have to give up some X. Otherwise I'll wait and see if they propose something.
