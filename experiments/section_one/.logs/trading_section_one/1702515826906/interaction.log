message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade to start us off. I am interested in acquiring more of both resources X and Y. Would you be interested in a balanced exchange to help us both increase our holdings?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer to initiate trade negotiations. My strategy is to propose a trade that appears fair without depleting my own resources too much, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I cannot accept your proposed trade because it would reduce my total resources. I am willing to trade if it allows me to gain more resources. Here is a counter proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 1 unit of Y in exchange for 7 units of X and 2 units of Y from me. This would reduce my total resources since I would be giving up more units than I gain.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should not accept trades that reduce my total resources. I will propose an alternative trade where I gain resources.

message: Hello Player BLUE. I see your point in wanting to increase your total resources. However, your counterproposal doesn't align with my goals of gaining more resources. Let's find a middle ground that could be beneficial for both of us. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable since it would result in a net loss of resources for me (10X + 5Y given versus 3X + 1Y received). I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial to my goal of acquiring more resources. I will adjust the amounts to ensure that I am gaining more resources than I am offering.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate you trying to find a fair trade, your latest proposal would still reduce my total resources. Unfortunately I have used my maximum of 3 chances to propose a counter trade. I can only accept or reject trades at this point. Could you propose an alternative where I gain resources?

<reason> Player RED has proposed a new trade where I would give up 8 X and 3 Y to gain 6 X and 2 Y. This would still result in me losing more resources than I gain.

I should counter propose to try to gain more resources, but I have already used up my 3 chances to propose a trade.

message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. Let's make sure this trade benefits us both. Hereâ€™s a revised proposal where you will gain a greater number of resources in total. I hope this meets your criteria for a beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has reached their maximum number of proposals and can no longer counter, I must provide a trade that is enticing enough for them to accept, while still benefiting my goal of increasing my total resources. I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gains more in quantity, but I still aim to have a net gain in value, considering that I do not know Player BLUE's resource amounts.
