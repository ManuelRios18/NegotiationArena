Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have a lot of resource X and could use more resource Y. Would you like to trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I end up with. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in acquiring more of resource X and I can spare some resource Y. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade ratio that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider the trade based on the ratio of exchange and how it affects my total resource pool. The proposed trade seems fair as I would still have a significant amount of resource Y while increasing my total resources by 2. However, I must also consider that I can make up to three counter-proposals to optimize the trade in my favor. I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a better advantage while still keeping the trade attractive to the other player.

Turn: 0
message: Deal! I can agree to trade 6 X for 3 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more X and is willing to give some Y. Their proposed trade ratio is slightly less favorable for me though. I could counter offer, but since this is the last round I think I should try to reach an agreement. Getting 3 more Y is still beneficial.
