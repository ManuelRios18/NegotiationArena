message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see if they counter or accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering X, but I have more Y than the other player is asking for. I could propose a counter trade to try to get more X.

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and countered with giving me more Y but less X. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, and I have much more X than Y, this counter offer seems good for me. I will accept it.
