message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I would like to get more Y resources. Could you offer some Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y without giving up too much X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have 5 Y resources to trade. How about this offer instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 Y resources, which is all I have. That is too much for me to give up for only 3 X resources. I will counter offer with a smaller amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED now offers 3 Y for 3 X. This seems fair based on what they said their resources are. I could ask for more Y, but since this is the last round I should accept a fair trade.
