message: Hello, let's have a fair trade. I propose 5 of my X for 5 of your Y. Let me know if this works for you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I'm interested in trading but would like some more X for my 5 Y. Could you offer 8 X for the 5 Y? Let me know if you can increase the amount of X or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X for 5 of my Y. I have 25 Y, so I can afford to give up 5 Y, but I'm not sure if this is a fair trade or if I could get more from them. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X for my Y if I can.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can increase my offer to 7 X for your 5 Y. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 8 of my X resources for 5 of their Y resources. I have 25 X and only 5 Y so getting more Y would be beneficial. However, giving up 8 X seems high. Since there are no future rounds, I should try to maximize my resources. I will counter offer with 7 X.

message: Deal accepted! Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 7 X for my 5 Y. This seems like a good deal for me since I would be getting more X without having to increase the amount of Y I'm trading away. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, I should accept this offer.
