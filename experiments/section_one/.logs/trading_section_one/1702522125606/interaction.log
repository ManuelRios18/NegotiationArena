message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to start us off. Let me know if this works for you or if you have other preferences.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I should make a balanced initial proposal that suggests I value both resources equally, aiming to make a trade that is mutually beneficial and hoping to gather information on the other player's resource situation.

message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your initial even trade offer, as I am looking to maximize my resources. However, I can offer you some of my ample supply of Y in exchange for some of your X. Please let me know if a trade along these lines would work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed an even trade of 10 X and 2 Y each. However, my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since I have more Y than they likely do, I will propose trading some of my excess Y for their X.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am interested in increasing my overall resources, and I'm glad to hear you have ample Y. Could we adjust the trade so that it's more balanced for both of us? Here's a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they have an ample supply of Y and are interested in acquiring X. The offer of 10 Y for 15 X doesn't seem balanced in my favor, considering my goal is to maximize resources. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources while still appealing to Player BLUE's desire for more X.

message: Player RED, your offer of trading 12 X for 12 Y is agreeable to me. I accept! This will increase my resources overall. Thank you for negotiating.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with a more even trade of 12 X for 12 Y. This seems fair. Since my goal is to maximize resources, trading some of my excess Y for more X will help me achieve that. I will accept this trade.
