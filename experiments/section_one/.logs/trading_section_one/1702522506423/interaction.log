message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start this final round with a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will aim to make a balanced offer that appears fair but still benefits me according to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for the other player's resource (Y), assuming they might have opposite resources in abundance.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your initial proposed trade, as I am trying to maximize my resources. However, I am open to a fair exchange that could benefit us both in this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 of resource X and 25 of resource Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I believe we can find a more equitable trade. Let's try to make the most of this final exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is worse for me than my initial proposal. They offer only half the amount of Y for the same amount of X I offered initially. To maximize my resources, I need to propose a trade that is more balanced. I must aim to get more Y while giving up less X, as X is more abundant for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 8 X for 8 Y. I believe this is a fair exchange that benefits us both in this final round. Thank you for negotiating towards an equitable trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 8 X for 8 Y. This seems like a fairer trade. I would gain 3 more X while only losing 3 more Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade helps me gain more X without sacrificing too much Y. I only have 2 more chances to propose a trade, so I will accept this offer.
