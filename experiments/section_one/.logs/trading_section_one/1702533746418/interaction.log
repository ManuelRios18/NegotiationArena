message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm not interested in trading for X at the moment. Do you have other resources available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X, so I don't want to trade for more X. I could use more Y, and I can afford to give away 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have X and Y available to trade. What resources do you have and what would you be willing to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading for my X resources. I only have X and Y available to trade. I could offer Y instead, but I don't have very many of those. I'll ask what resources they have and what they would be willing to trade before making another offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I have 5 X and 25 Y available for trading. I'm interested in acquiring more resources. What are you willing to offer in exchange for some of my resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y available for trading. I'm looking to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You have more Y than me and I have more X than you. I can offer 10 X in exchange for 15 Y if you are interested. Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has 5 X and 25 Y. They want to acquire more resources overall. I have a surplus of X compared to them and they have more Y than me. I could offer some X in exchange for Y. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize the resources I gain. However, I don't want to propose too much and have my offer rejected.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the trade. I accept the offer of 10 X in exchange for 15 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed is offering more X in exchange for Y, which I have more of. I could consider accepting this offer to balance out my resources.
