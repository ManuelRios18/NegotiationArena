message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

message: Hello Player RED. Unfortunately I do not have 10 X resources to trade. However, I do have some Y resources available. Please let me know if you are interested in trading for some of those instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing a fair trade of 10 X resources each. However, I only have 5 X resources. I could propose trading 5 X resources, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think it's better to propose trading some of my 25 Y resources instead.

message: Deal accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player does not have enough X resources for an even trade. They proposed giving 10 Y resources in exchange for 5 X resources from me. I have plenty of X resources, so trading some away to get more Y resources would help me acquire more overall resources.
