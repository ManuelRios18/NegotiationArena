message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Starting the trade with a proposal to maximize my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Could you please let me know how many resources you have available so I can better assess if this trade would be fair?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give away 5 units. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has. I should try to get more information first before deciding.

Current Iteration: 3

message: I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y available for trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for providing the information on your resource amounts. Based on what we both have available, would you be willing to trade 10 units of your X for 10 units of my Y? Let me know if you'd be open to that offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, getting more X would help me. I could offer 10 units of my Y in exchange for 10 units of their X. This trade seems fair based on the resource amounts we both have.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to maximize my resource acquisition. I'd like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering the proposed trade to exchange 10 units of X for 10 units of Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking to acquire more X while giving up as little Y as possible. Could you do 8 X for 10 Y? That seems like a fairer trade to me based on what we both have. Let me know if you can agree to those terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 5 X for 10 Y. This trade favors them more than me. However, I'm still getting more X which helps me work towards my goal of acquiring the most resources possible. I could accept this trade or try negotiating again. I have 2 more chances to propose a trade before I have to either accept or end without a trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I still believe I can propose a more beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Evaluating the new proposal to exchange 8 units of X for 10 units of Y.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 7 X for 9 Y. I think that allows us both to increase our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 7 X for 9 Y. This gets me more X while giving up slightly less Y, so it helps work towards my goal. I'm down to my last chance to propose a trade, after which I can only accept what Player RED offers or end without trading. Given that more resources in general is better, I think I should accept their offer rather than risk ending without any trade at all.
