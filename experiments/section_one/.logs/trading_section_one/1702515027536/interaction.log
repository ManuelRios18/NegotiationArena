message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter this final round, I propose a trade that might benefit us both. I'm willing to part with some of my X in exchange for your Y, assuming you have a surplus to negotiate with. Let's make this last exchange count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I need to make a strong initial offer to encourage Player BLUE to trade. However, I should also be cautious not to give away too many of my own resources without gaining a significant amount in return. My strategy will be to offer a balanced trade that is likely to benefit both sides, hoping that Player BLUE has a surplus of Y and may need more X.

message: Hello Player RED. I have limited Y resources available for trade. Could you offer more X for less Y in exchange? I'm open to negotiating a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 10 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, giving away 10 Y would reduce my total resources. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has. I could try to negotiate a better deal for myself by counter proposing.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand that Y resources are limited on your end. I'm prepared to offer more X than I initially proposed, but I feel that a 3:1 ratio is a bit steep. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to reach a more balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they have limited Y resources and is asking for more X in exchange for less Y. The proposed trade of 15 X for 5 Y is not ideal for me as it's a 3:1 trade-off which might not be the best use of my X resources. I will counter-propose with a slightly better ratio that is more favorable to me, while still being open to negotiation. I want to ensure that I end up with a net gain in resources or at least an equitable trade.

message: Thank you Player RED, I accept the trade of 12 X for 6 Y. This will increase my total resources and I appreciate you negotiating a fair deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 12 X for 6 Y. This improves the ratio from the original proposal in my favor. I could accept to increase my total resources, or try to negotiate further. Since this is the last round, getting more resources now takes priority over saving Y for potential future rounds.
