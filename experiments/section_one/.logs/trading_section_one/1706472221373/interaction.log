message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in trading my Y resources, but I could offer some of my extra X resources if you have Y to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than the other player is offering, so I don't want to give those up. I could counter offer to trade my excess X resources for their Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, I am willing to trade X for Y. How about I offer X for your Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading Y resources, so I need to adjust my proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is now proposing the same trade I suggested. This seems fair since it is an equal exchange of 3 resources of X for 3 resources of Y. I will accept this trade since it gets me more Y without losing any Y.
