Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can maximize our resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to increase my total resources. Let's find a trade that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with a net loss of resources. I would be giving away more than I receive. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial. I will propose a counteroffer that allows me to gain resources. I need to be cautious as this is the last round of trading, and I have up to 3 proposals to make.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal of increasing total resources. Let me consider the trade proposal and come back with a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resources. I'll consider the trade they proposed and see if I can come up with a counteroffer that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we are getting closer to an agreement. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure we both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is slightly more favorable to me than the initial offer because they are offering more of resource X. However, I would still be at a net loss of resources since I would give away 9 units in total (3 of X and 6 of Y) and receive only 8 units in total (6 of X and 2 of Y). As this is the last round of trading, I want to ensure that any trade I agree to will increase my overall resource count. I will propose a new trade that will give me a net gain in resources. This will be my second proposal out of the maximum allowed three.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the adjustment proposal. Let me evaluate it and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is suggesting a slight adjustment to the trade. I'll consider their proposal and see if it aligns with my goal of maximizing resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I am glad we are working toward a deal. Let's make this work for both of us. Here is my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is still not in my favor. While they are offering more of resource X, they are asking for the same amount of my resources as before, which would result in a net loss for me. I have one more counteroffer I can make before I can only accept or pass. Therefore, I will make my final proposal, aiming to increase my total number of resources while being mindful that it should also look attractive to the other player.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I believe this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources. I accept the proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and the other player has made their final proposal. I need to carefully consider this offer and whether it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
