message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I'm willing to offer some of my resources in exchange for yours.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what the other player is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade that I believe is more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not particularly favorable, as it stands it's a 1:1 trade of X for Y. Given that I have a larger quantity of Y, I might be inclined to offer more Y for less X to increase my total resource count, but I need to be careful not to undervalue my resources. Since this is the last round, I need to make it count and aim for a trade that increases my total resources maximally. I'll propose a counteroffer that I find more balanced and beneficial to my goals.

message: I accept your offer. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a trade where I give X: 5 and receive Y: 10. This seems like a good offer since I have an abundance of X and could benefit from more Y.
