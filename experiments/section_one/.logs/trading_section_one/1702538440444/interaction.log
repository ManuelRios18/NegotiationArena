message: Hello! I have extra X resources available. Would you trade 2 Y resources for 5 X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make an fair proposal. I'll start with offering 5 X for 2 Y and see if the other player counters.

message: Thank you for the offer. It seems like a fair trade, and I'm happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Based on the trade proposed by Player RED, they are offering 5 of resource X for 2 of resource Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would increase my total resources by 3 units. Without any information on the other player's resource status, and because this is the last round of trading, it may be beneficial to accept this trade to maximize my resources.
