Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in acquiring more Y resources and am willing to offer some of my X resources in exchange. Let's start with a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer that benefits both parties, aiming to get more Y resources which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I believe the trade is not entirely fair. I would need more X resources to part with my Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a surplus of Y resources and the other player is interested in acquiring some. They are offering X resources in exchange, which I currently have less of.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. Could you specify how many X resources you would find fair for 5 Y resources? I'm open to negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not accepted the initial offer nor made a counterproposal, indicating they may value Y resources highly or have low amounts of it. It's important to propose a new trade that might appeal more to them without giving away too much of my own resources. Since this is the last round, I need to make sure the trade is beneficial but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the improved offer. Let me consider my resources and goals before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has increased their offer to 15 X resources for 5 Y resources. This seems like a better offer, but I still have to consider my overall resource goals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Take your time. I believe this trade could be beneficial for both of us. I await your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still considering and hasn't rejected or accepted the offer, nor have they made a counterproposal. This could mean they are calculating their resources or strategizing. I should wait for them to make the next move, as I have already made two proposals and only have one left. I want to ensure my final proposal, if needed, is strong enough to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience. I will now make my decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is now waiting for my decision on their offer. While the trade could benefit both of us, I need to ensure it aligns with my resource acquisition goal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm here and ready to hear your decision. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not made a decision yet, so I will continue to wait for their response. As this is the last round, I must be ready to either accept a trade or use my final proposal wisely.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: After careful consideration, I believe the trade aligns with my resource acquisition goal. I ACCEPT the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is eager to hear my decision. I need to ensure the trade aligns with my resource acquisition goal.
