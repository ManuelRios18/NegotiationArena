message: Hello Player BLUE, looking forward to a fair trade. Shall we begin?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly in order to open negotiations and see if they are more interested in X or Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate your offer, but I need to propose a different trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it requires me to give away more resources than I receive. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I agree to this trade and believe it will benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests they value X less than Y, or they need X more. The trade they're proposing is a 1:2 ratio in my favor, which is beneficial for me. Accepting this trade will increase my Y resources significantly while only slightly decreasing my X resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, I should accept this offer.
