message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. Let me review my resources and see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X resources, but I have more of Y. I need to assess if this trade is beneficial for me.

message: No problem, take your time looking over your resources. Let me know what you think would be a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems open to trading but did not make a counteroffer yet. I will wait and see what they propose before modifying my offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering a trade that would give me more X resources. Let me propose a trade that would be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than X. I need to propose a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm afraid trading 15 Y would leave me quite low. How about we do a 1:1 ratio instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is proposing to trade me 7 X for 15 Y. This would leave me with very few Y which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counteroffer with a more balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concern about having low Y resources. Let me review and see if we can find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The 1:1 ratio proposed trade would help balance my resources, but I want to try to get more X resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time to review the options and resources. Let me know if you have another proposal for a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still reviewing. I will wait for their counterproposal before making any additional changes to my offer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering a trade that balances our resources and benefits both of us. Let me propose a trade that could work for both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still have more Y resources than X. I need to come up with a trade that helps balance my resources and benefits me more.
