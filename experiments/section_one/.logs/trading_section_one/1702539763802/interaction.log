Turn: 0
message: Hello other player. I have extra X resources and I'm interested in getting more Y resources. Would you like to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5X for 5Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a deal that gives me a better advantage. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from the other player is an even trade: 5 of their X for 5 of my Y. This seems like a fair exchange, however, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that is more favorable to me. I want to make a counteroffer that would give me more X resources while giving up fewer Y resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give 6 X resources if you increase the Y resources to 7. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with an offer for me to give up 8 X resources for only 5 Y resources. That's not a very good deal for me. However, since I don't know how many resources they have, I should make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but could still be acceptable to them. I'll propose giving up just 6 X resources instead of 8.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, but I would still like a better exchange on my end. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 6 X for 6 Y. This way, we both get an equal increase in resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counteroffer isn't as favorable as my initial proposal. They are asking for more Y resources in exchange for fewer X resources than I asked for. However, since my goal is to maximize resources, I should consider if this trade is beneficial overall. Trading 7 Y for 6 X would still increase my total resource count by 1. However, I should try to negotiate a better deal since this is the last round and I should aim for the most advantageous trade possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I will give you 6 X resources in exchange for 6 Y resources. Thank you for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered again, now proposing a trade of 6 X resources for 6 Y resources. This seems fair - we would both be getting the same number of the other's resources. And since I have more X to spare, I can afford to make this trade. I'll accept their offer so we can complete the trade.
