They are asking for more Y resources in exchange for fewer X resources than I asked for. However, since my goal is to maximize resources, I should consider if this trade is beneficial overall. Trading 7 Y for 6 X would still increase my total resource count by 1. However, I should try to negotiate a better deal since this is the last round and I should aim for the most advantageous trade possible. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I see your point, but I would still like a better exchange on my end. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 6 X for 6 Y. This way, we both get an equal increase in resources. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 </newly proposed trade>"
