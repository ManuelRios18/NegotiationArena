message: Hello Player BLUE, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if Player BLUE is willing to make a deal.

message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading any of my limited X resources without getting some Y resources in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 0, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 0
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, so I can afford to give away 5 Y. However, I only have 5 X resources, so I don't want to give any of those away unless I get some Y resources in return.

message: Player RED, I am willing to give you some of my plentiful Y resources if you can give me some X resources in return. Could you offer 3 X for 5 Y?

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
