message: Hello Player BLUE, I am proposing we trade resources to benefit both of us in this last round. Please consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, I have analyzed the trade and determined that rejecting it will leave me with more total resources in this final round based on the information I have. I would be open to a different offer that allows me to acquire more resources. Please let me know if you have another proposal, otherwise I can make an offer on my next turn.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should analyze if this trade benefits me in that regard. 

I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. If I accept the trade, I will have 15 units of X and 10 units of Y. This means I will have more X but less Y.

Since the rules state that more resources in general are always better and this is the last round, I should try to maximize my total resources.  

15 units of X + 10 units of Y = 25 total resources if I accept.
5 units of X + 25 units of Y = 30 total resources if I reject.

Rejecting leaves me with more total resources (30 > 25), so I should not accept this offer.

message: Player BLUE, I understand you want to maximize your resources. Here is another offer for more Y on your side:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE rejected my initial offer, indicating they analyzed it was not beneficial for them. They seem to want to acquire more total resources in this final round. I still have more X than I need, so I could offer more Y to convince them.

message: Player RED, thank you for the new offer, but I have analyzed again and rejecting gives me more total resources to maximize what I'm trying to achieve. I would like to propose the following trade instead that I believe helps us both:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade - they will give me 15 units of X in exchange for 20 units of my Y.

If I accept, I will have:
X: 15 + 5 = 20
Y: 25 - 20 = 5

Total resources = 20 + 5 = 25

If I reject, I keep my current resources: 
X: 5  
Y: 25
Total resources = 30

Rejecting again leaves me with more total resources (30 > 25). 

I still have 2 more chances to propose my own trade before I'm limited to just accepting or rejecting. I should try to make an offer that benefits me.

message: Player BLUE, I am interested in trading for more Y but your request for 20 X is too high for me. Can we agree on a lower X amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my offer again, trying to maximize their own resources. However, their counter offer takes a lot of my X resources. I still need some X, so I could try to negotiate the amount down while still giving them more Y.

message: Player RED, I have analyzed again and must reject to maximize my resources. I understand you feel 20 X is too high. I have one more trade offer I can propose - how about meeting in the middle with 15 X for 12 Y? Please let me know if you can agree to this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 12 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered my proposed trade, suggesting 10 X for 15 Y instead of my offer of 20 X for 10 Y.

If I accept their counter offer:
X: 10 + 5 = 15  
Y: 25 - 15 = 10
Total resources = 25

If I reject, I keep:
X: 5
Y: 25 
Total resources = 30

Rejecting again leaves me with more total resources. 

I have 1 trade proposal left that I can make. Let me think what could get Player RED to agree to trade me more X...

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of me giving 15 X for 12 Y. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has come down to 15 X for 12 Y. This still takes a lot of my main resource, but gets me a good amount of Y that I'm lacking. I'm running out of proposals so I should consider accepting. The tradeoff seems fair.
