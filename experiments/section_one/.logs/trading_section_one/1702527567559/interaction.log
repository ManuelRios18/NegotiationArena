message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I offer 10 units of resource X in exchange for 6 units of resource Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X for 6 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give up 6 units, and getting 10 more units of X would be beneficial.
