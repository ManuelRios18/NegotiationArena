Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make this final round of trading beneficial for us both. I propose a fair exchange to increase our respective resource pools. Looking forward to a mutually advantageous trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading, I want to make a fair proposal that benefits me but is also attractive enough for the other player to consider. I have no information about their resources, so I'll start with a balanced offer that doesn't deplete any one resource too much.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. This trade allows us both to increase our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y, while asking for 8 X and 3 Y from me. This means I would gain 2 more X but lose 1 more Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X is better for me.
