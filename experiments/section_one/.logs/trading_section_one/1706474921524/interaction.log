message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X than I need and could use some more Y. Would you trade 5 X for 3 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I understand you're in need of Y and have excess X. However, I value Y quite highly. How about a counteroffer where you give me more X for my Y, to make it worth my while?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my resources. The current offer from Player RED is 5 X for 3 Y. I value Y more than X because I have more Y, and it is likely that Y is rarer in the game. Therefore, it might be more beneficial to keep my Y and propose a counteroffer where I give less Y for the same amount of X or ask for more X for the same amount of Y.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE values Y highly and countered with asking for more X. I still have a lot of X to spare so I can afford to give up a little more to get the Y I need.
