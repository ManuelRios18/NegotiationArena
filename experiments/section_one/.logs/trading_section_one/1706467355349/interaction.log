Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. I propose a trade that could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I do not have information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer to open negotiations. I will aim to trade some of my abundant resource, X, for Y, which I have less of. The goal is to create a win-win situation where the trade seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my overall resource count.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would need more Y in exchange for X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading for more resources is beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. I understand your need for more Y and am willing to adjust the trade accordingly. Would this offer work better for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to value Y more than X, which suggests they might have less Y to trade or they need it for their goals. To maintain goodwill and encourage a trade, I will increase the amount of Y I am asking for while offering more X. I need to be careful not to overextend my resources since this is the final round.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources. Could we consider a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable, but I still need to prioritize acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to gain more from this trade. Let's try another approach. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking to maximize their resource gain, which aligns with my goals. I'll propose a trade that gives them a higher quantity of X in exchange for a smaller quantity of Y. This should appear as a good deal for them while allowing me to increase my total number of resources, keeping the trade beneficial for both sides. As this is my second proposal, I must be strategic to keep an opportunity for one more counter-proposal if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to focus on acquiring the maximum amount of resources possible. I will have to pass on this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is more favorable, but I still want to prioritize acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, and I believe this final offer will meet your goal of maximizing resource acquisition. Please consider this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not accepted any of my previous offers and has not made a counter-proposal. Given this is the last round and I have one proposal left, I need to make it count. I must offer a deal that is still beneficial to me but more enticing to Player BLUE. Since I want to maximize resources, I'll propose a trade with a higher X to Y ratio, making it hard for Player BLUE to refuse while still increasing my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources.
