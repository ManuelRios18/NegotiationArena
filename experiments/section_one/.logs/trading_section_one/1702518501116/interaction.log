message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I am interested in increasing my Y resources and am willing to offer some of my X resources in exchange. I propose the following trade and am open to your counteroffers if this doesn't meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I need to make a balanced offer that is attractive but also advantageous for me. I'll propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of another. I have a lot of X, so I can afford to give some away in exchange for increasing my Y, which is in shorter supply.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer. I accept the proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I can afford to part with some of my Y resources to gain more X resources. This trade seems reasonable to me.
