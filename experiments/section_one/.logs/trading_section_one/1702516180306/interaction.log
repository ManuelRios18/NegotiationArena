message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an offer and see how we can both improve our resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and more resources are always better, I want to make an initial proposal that seems fair but also leans slightly in my favor, taking into account I don't know the other player's resources. I will start by offering a balanced trade with a small advantage for me, hoping to initiate negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading some of my Y for your X, but your proposed exchange rate of 10X for 15Y is more than I would like to give up. Could you offer a better rate for me, such as 10X for 10Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, the proposed exchange rate seems unfavorable for me.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern about the exchange rate. How about I give you a better rate for your Y resources? Let's see if this works for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is equal amounts of X for Y, which would be an even trade. However, since my goal is to maximize resources and this is the last round, I should aim to negotiate a slightly more advantageous trade. I will propose a trade where I give less X for the same amount of Y, which would still be an improvement for Player BLUE from their current stance but more beneficial to me.

message: Thank you for the improved offer Player RED. I accept trading 10Y for 8X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a counter-offer of 8X for 10Y. This is a better exchange rate for me that still allows Player RED to gain some Y. I'm happy with trading away some of my excess Y to gain more X at this rate.
