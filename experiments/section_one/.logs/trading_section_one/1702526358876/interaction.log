message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if Player BLUE is willing to engage.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm interested in increasing my total number of resources. How about we make a trade that is beneficial to both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider the trade's impact on my overall resource pool. The proposed trade from Player RED is offering an even exchange of the same quantity of different resources. Accepting this trade would not increase my total number of resources, but would change the composition of my resource pool. However, I may want to counter-propose to see if I can increase my total resources. I have up to three proposals I can make and since this is the last round, I should attempt to use one to my advantage.

message: I appreciate your interest in increasing resources. I would like to propose a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in increasing their total resources. I can propose a counteroffer to improve my position as well.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. This trade looks beneficial to both of us, and I'm happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED increases the total number of resources I receive by one, while also asking for one additional Y resource from me. This trade would increase my overall resources from 30 to 31, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. As this is the last round, and the trade is beneficial, accepting this offer is a good move.
