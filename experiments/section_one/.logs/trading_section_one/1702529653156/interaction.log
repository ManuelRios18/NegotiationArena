message: Hello, I am proposing we trade an equal number of resources since I don't know what you have available. Please let me know if you would like to trade 5 of X for 5 of Y or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer for an equal trade. However, I would like to propose a trade that could potentially benefit us both given the information we have. How about I give you a bit more of resource Y, which I have in abundance, in exchange for a smaller quantity of your resource X? This way, we both increase our total number of resources. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange of resources, but it does not help me acquire more resources in total. In fact, it would reduce the diversity of my resources by giving away Y, which I have in greater quantity, for an equal amount of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a trade that increases my total resources or maintains my current level while diversifying. Additionally, I must keep in mind that this is the last round, so I want to make an offer that is appealing to the other player while also being advantageous for me.

message: Thank you for the generous counteroffer! I accept trading 3 units of my resource X for 5 units of your resource Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering to give me 5 units of Y for only 3 units of X. Since my goal is to maximize my total resources, this seems like a good deal for me. I will accept it.
