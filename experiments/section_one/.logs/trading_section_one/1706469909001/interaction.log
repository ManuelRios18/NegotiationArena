message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources to benefit both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am willing to trade but I think we can find a deal that benefits us both more. What do you think about me giving you 2 X and 5 Y for 7 X from you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X and 2 Y in exchange for 3 X and 3 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to get more X. However, since the goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to maximize my overall resources. I would be open to a different trade that can benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more Y but at the cost of losing a significant amount of X. I need to maximize my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to future trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer to give me 6 X and 2 Y in exchange for 2 X and 5 Y from me. This improves the amount of X I would receive. Since X is more scarce for me, this helps move toward my goal of acquiring as many total resources as possible. I could try negotiating further, but I think this is a good enough deal for both sides that I will accept it.
