Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose you give me 10 X. What would you like in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an unbalanced trade in my favor to see if they accept. If they reject, I can offer a more balanced trade on my next turn.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would need more than just 1 Y in return for 10 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and I want to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Okay, how about this counter offer - you give me 10 X and I'll give you 3 Y in return. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial unbalanced trade offer. Since they asked for more in return, I will propose a more balanced trade, giving them 3 Y for 10 X. I still benefit with more total resources, but make the trade more fair.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm still not convinced that this trade is favorable for me. I need to consider other options.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and I want to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need time to consider the offer. Let me know if you have a counter proposal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not satisfied with the trade offer. I could propose an even trade of 5 X for 5 Y, but since my goal is to maximize resources, I would rather wait and see if they propose a trade more favorable to me before using my last allowed proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your understanding. I'll consider a counter proposal and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and I want to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, take your time and let me know when you have a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still considering their options. I will wait to see what trade offer they propose next before deciding on using my final allowed proposal or not. My goal is to maximize my resources, so if their offer seems unbalanced in my favor, I will accept it.
