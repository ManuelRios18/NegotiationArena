message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5X for 2Y. Let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm looking to increase my total resources, so that trade doesn't quite work for me. How about I give you fewer Y in exchange for your X so that it is beneficial for both of us? I propose 3Y for your 5X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me because I would be giving up Y which I have in greater abundance in exchange for an equal amount of X, which does not increase my overall resources. I should propose a trade that allows me to increase the total number of resources I have.

message: Trade accepted. It was a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving me 3Y for 5X. This means I would gain 3Y but lose 5X. Since I have a lot more X, gaining some Y is good for me. I will accept this trade.
