message: Hello, let's trade resources. I am proposing 1 X for 1 Y to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading, so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing a small trade to test what resources they may have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I have enough Y and need more X. I'll propose a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4, X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable for me as I have more Y and less X. I need to propose a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to gain more total resources. Could you offer 3 X for the 4 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade and proposed trading equal amounts of X and Y. This would not change my total resources, so does not help me meet my goal of acquiring more resources. I will counter offer by asking for more X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your goal, but I need to balance my resources as well. How about I propose a trade that benefits us both equally?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to gain more total resources, but the proposed trade is not favorable for me as I have more Y and less X. I need to counteroffer to benefit both of us.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with an offer of 8 Y for 4 X. This would increase my total resources from 30 to 31. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I will accept this trade.
