message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking to diversify my portfolio and would like to make an offer that could benefit us both. Let's start this final round with a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or goals, my initial proposal should aim to increase my total resource count while also being appealing to the other player. I will start by offering a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y, which I have less of, to see if the other player values one resource over the other.

message: This trade offer benefits us both. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. This seems like a good trade for me since I would gain more X overall.
