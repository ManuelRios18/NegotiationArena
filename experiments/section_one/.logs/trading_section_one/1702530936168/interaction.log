message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see if they counter offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. To make the trade more appealing, I would like to propose a different exchange where we can both increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is a 1:1 trade of X for Y. Since I have no information about Player RED's resources, I cannot determine if this trade is beneficial to me based on scarcity. However, as my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, a 1:1 trade does not increase my total amount of resources. I will reject the offer and propose a trade that gives me more resources in total.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing that I give up 10 X and 5 Y in exchange for 15 Y from them. This means I would end up with 15 X and 15 Y total if I accept. That's an overall gain of 10 resources for me (losing 15 but gaining 25). Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade is beneficial. I only have 3 chances to propose a trade myself, so I will accept this offer rather than trying to negotiate further.
