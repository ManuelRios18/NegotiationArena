message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to enhance both of our resource pools. Let's make the most out of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I don't know the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that gives me a slight advantage. It's important to start with an offer that is attractive enough to the other player but also serves my goal of acquiring more resources.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 10 X for 15 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to make this trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, getting 10 more X would help me.
