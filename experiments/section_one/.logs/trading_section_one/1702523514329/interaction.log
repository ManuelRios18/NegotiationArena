message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade. How about I give you 10 units of resource X in exchange for 6 units of resource Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not willing to part with my Y resources at the moment unless I get more X in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, giving away less Y to gain more X seems beneficial.

message: I understand your position. Let me think about the trade you proposed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in more X in exchange for Y. I need to consider if this trade is worth it for me.

Turn: 1
message: I am open to negotiating if you have a new offer. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED did not accept or propose a new trade. I will wait to see if they come back with a counteroffer before proposing anything new myself.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for being open to negotiation. How about I give you 12 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to negotiating. I need to come up with a new offer that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 12 units of X for 6 units of my Y. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a better offer, proposing to give me 12 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y. This improves the trade in my favor while still costing me the same amount of my Y resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this new offer seems good.
