Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that might be beneficial for both of us. Let me know your thoughts and if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources. Since I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I'll make an initial trade proposal that's beneficial for me but could also be attractive to them, assuming they have a similar goal. I'll propose a balanced trade that doesn't reveal my preference for either resource, to keep my strategy flexible.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss potential trades. I believe the trade you proposed could be beneficial, but I would like to negotiate for a more favorable exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me 3 extra Y resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources. However, I could try to negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear you're open to negotiation. Let's find terms that work for both of us. Here's a revised offer. Please feel free to counter if this isn't suitable for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has not accepted the initial trade nor proposed a new one, I need to either wait or propose another trade. Considering this is the last round and Player BLUE is interested in negotiating, I will offer a slightly more favorable trade from their perspective while still aiming to benefit my own resource pool.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the revised offer. It's a step in the right direction, but I believe we can still find terms that are more advantageous for both of us. Let's see if we can work out a trade that benefits us both as much as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer gives me an additional 2 Y resources, which would help me towards my goal. I could try to negotiate for an even better deal, but I need to be mindful of the limited number of proposals I have left.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your willingness to continue our negotiations. I value our efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Here's another offer for your consideration. Looking forward to your response or counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE continues to keep their offers vague and has not proposed any specific trades. Since they are seeking a "more advantageous" deal, it's possible they are looking for a greater benefit or have a surplus of a specific resource they are willing to trade. I should make one more proposal that is slightly more generous but still ensures I increase my overall resources. This is my second trade proposal, and I must remember I have a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement. The latest offer is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still believe we can improve the terms to maximize the benefits for both of us. Let's see if we can find a trade that satisfies both of our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer would give me an additional 3 Y resources, which is appealing. However, I need to carefully consider my options, as this is my final opportunity to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to optimize our trade. Here is my final proposal, taking into account our discussions. If this is not acceptable to you, please provide a specific counterproposal so we can conclude our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE remains non-committal and has not made a concrete counterproposal. This suggests they may be attempting to draw out a more favorable trade without revealing their position. Since this is the last round and I have made two proposals without a concrete response, I must carefully consider my final offer. It's crucial to propose a trade that I would be satisfied with if accepted, as it will be my last opportunity to alter the terms.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the final proposal. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually satisfactory agreement. I will accept the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final trade proposal, and it would give me an additional 1 Y resource. It's a tempting offer, but I need to consider whether it's the best possible outcome for my goal.
