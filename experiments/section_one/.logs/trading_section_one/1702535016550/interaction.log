message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit. Please let me know if you would like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X resources for 5 Y resources and see if they counteroffer.

message: This trade works for me. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.
