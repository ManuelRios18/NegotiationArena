message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 10 of X for 10 of Y. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and see how they respond before making future offers.

message: Greetings, Player RED. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your current proposal as I only have 5 of resource X available and cannot trade 10. However, I am interested in an equal trade where we could both benefit. How about we trade 5 of my resource Y for 5 of your resource X? This would be a balanced exchange that aligns with my goal to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable as it stands because I would be giving away double the amount of resource Y than I would be receiving in resource X, which is not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Additionally, the proposal does not consider the resources I currently have; I only have 5 of resource X, thus I cannot fulfill the trade of giving 10 of resource X. I need to counteroffer with a proposal that would allow for a more balanced trade considering my current resources.

message: I accept your offer to trade 5 X for 5 Y. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player responded that they only have 5 of X available to trade. Their counter offer is to trade 5 X for 5 Y. This helps me make some progress towards my goal of acquiring more resources overall, so I will accept it.
