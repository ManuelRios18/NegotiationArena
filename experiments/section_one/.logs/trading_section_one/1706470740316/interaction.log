message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I am looking for a trade that would increase my total resources. Would you consider a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. I need to make a counteroffer that allows me to gain more resources overall. I have to remember that this is the last round and that I should aim to maximize my gains. It might be strategic to offer a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (Y) to get more of the scarce one (X), which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal of increasing total resources. I'm willing to consider the trade you proposed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a trade that increases their total resources. I will consider the proposed trade and respond.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade looks good to me. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is acceptable as it aligns with my goals of increasing my total resources. By accepting this trade, I would be exchanging 5 units of my more abundant resource (Y) for 6 units of the scarcer resource (X), which is a favorable exchange for me. As this is the last round, finalizing a trade that increases my stockpile is a priority, and this trade achieves that.
