message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Shall we start by exchanging some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I do not know the other player's resources or their goals, I should make a proposal that is slightly in my favor while still being reasonable, to initiate the trading process and gauge their response. I will propose a balanced trade that might be appealing to the other player, without giving away too much of my own resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I am willing to trade some Y for X to balance my resources, but your proposed trade takes too much Y from me. Could you propose something where I give less Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I don't want to give up too many of my Y.

message: Thank you for your willingness to trade, Player BLUE. I understand your concern. Let's find a middle ground that could work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is willing to trade Y for X but wants to give less Y than initially proposed. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider a counterproposal that still gives me a net gain in resources. I'll propose a trade with a better Y to X ratio for Player BLUE, but still advantageous for me. This is my first counterproposal out of the allowed three.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your proposed trade of 10 X for 7 Y. This will allow both of us to gain more balanced resources. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 10 X for 7 Y. This trade gives me more X while still allowing me to keep most of my Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a good deal to accept.
