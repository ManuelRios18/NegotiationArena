message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to make a fair trade that would benefit us both. As this is the final round, let's make it count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I aim to acquire as many resources as possible, I will attempt to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial for both parties without knowing the other player's resources. I will propose a balanced trade initially to open negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your offer of 10 X for 10 Y does not work for me. I can offer 5 Y for 10 X if that interests you. Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 of resource X and 25 of resource Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm looking to keep the trade more balanced. How about we trade at a 1:1 ratio? I propose 8 X for 8 Y. I believe this would be more equitable for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not advantageous for me, as I would be giving up double the amount of X for Y. However, considering it is the last round, I should attempt to negotiate a more favorable trade without being too aggressive, in order to not end up with no trade at all. I will counter with a balanced trade that maintains a 1:1 ratio, which should be more appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate the counteroffer. A 1:1 ratio seems fair. However, would you be willing to increase the amount of X to 10 for the 8 Y? That would help me work towards my goal of acquiring more resources while still keeping the trade balanced. Please let me know if that interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 8 X for 8 Y. This is a more fair trade at a 1:1 ratio. However, my goal is to maximize resources. I still have 17 Y left if I trade 8 away. I could counter to try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Your proposal sounds reasonable. Let's finalize the trade: I will give you 10 X in exchange for your 8 Y. This will help both of us achieve our goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is slightly more favorable to them than to me, as they ask for more of resource X than they offer of resource Y. However, considering this is the last trading round, it may be beneficial to accept a slightly less favorable deal rather than risk ending with no additional resources at all. Trading 10 X for 8 Y is a compromise that still increases my total resource count and helps me towards my goal.
