message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Without knowing your resource situation, I propose a balanced trade that could benefit us both. I am willing to trade some of my X for your Y, hoping it aligns with your goals as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and since I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I need to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to me while possibly being attractive to Player BLUE. I need to keep in mind that this trade could be accepted and end the game, so I should aim to increase my resources as much as possible without knowing the other player's goals or resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in acquiring more X. I can offer 7 Y for your 10 X. Would that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of their X for 10 of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y. I have a lot of Y to trade, so I can offer less Y for their X.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking for a trade that would be more equitable. Would you consider a slightly different exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a desire to acquire more X and has proposed a counteroffer of 7 Y for 10 X. This counteroffer is not as beneficial to me as I would be giving up more value than I'm receiving based on a 1:1 trade ratio which I initially proposed. Since I aim to maximize my resources and this is the last round, I should counter with a proposal that increases my Y while giving up less X.

message: I have plenty of Y to trade. To make the trade more equitable for both of us, I propose trading 6 of my Y for your 7 X. Does this work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with trading 7 X for 7 Y. This is more equitable, but since I have a lot more Y, I can afford to trade less Y for their X. I will counter again, proposing to trade 6 Y for their 7 X.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. We are getting closer to an agreement. How about we meet almost halfway from my initial offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is better than their last one but still offers less Y than the X I am giving up. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, I should aim for a 1:1 trade or, ideally, receive more Y than the X I am giving up, considering this is the final round and I won't have another chance to trade. I will make one final proposal that is closer to my initial offer but still provides Player BLUE with more X than they're giving Y in hopes of reaching an agreement.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 8 X for 7 Y. Thank you for negotiating an equitable trade that helps us both meet our goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 8 X for 7 Y. This gets me more X for less Y compared to their previous offer, while still being equitable. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade helps me do that. I will accept their offer.
