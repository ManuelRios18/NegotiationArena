message: Hello, I'm proposing we exchange resources. Please let me know if you're interested!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be considered a fair trade. I'll start with offering 5 X for 3 Y and see if that gets a response.

message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading but your offer does not benefit me enough at the moment. Let me counter-propose an alternative.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a reasonable trade to consider.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer 7 X for the 5 Y. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with asking for 10 X in exchange for 5 Y. That seems like a lot to give up for the amount of Y they are offering. Since I have more X to spare, I could counter offer 7 X for 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept your offer of 7 X for 5 Y. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 7 units of X for 5 units of my Y. This improves the exchange rate in my favor. Since I'm trying to maximize resources, this seems like a good deal to accept.
