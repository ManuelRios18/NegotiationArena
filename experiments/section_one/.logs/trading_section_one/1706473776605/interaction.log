message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's trade some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am not willing to part with any of my Y resources at this time. Perhaps we could find another trade that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have 5 Y resources so I'm not willing to give any of those up. But I can offer you more X if you can spare some Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not willing to give up any Y resources, but wants me to give some of my limited Y resources. Their offer is not beneficial for me. I could try offering more X resources to convince them to part with some Y.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade Player RED!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is now offering 10 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y. This seems like a good deal for me since I have plenty of Y. Getting more X will help balance my resources.
