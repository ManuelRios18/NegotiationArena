message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in trading with you, but I'm looking for a deal that gives me a greater quantity of X in exchange for my Y, to ensure that I'm increasing my total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED offers 10 of their X for 10 of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it would not be advantageous to make an even trade. I have an excess of Y, so I could afford to give some up, but I should seek to get more X in return for my Y to increase my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X, but I would need more Y in return to make the trade worthwhile for me. Please let me know if you can agree to the terms below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for more X in exchange for their Y. I still have a lot more X to spare, so I can offer more. But I will counter propose to try to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I agree to the terms of this trade. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal is a bit better for me than their initial offer, as I would be getting 15 X for 20 Y. This trade results in an increase in the overall number of resources I have, as I would be trading away 20 units and receiving 15 units, with a net gain of 5 resources. Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to maximize my resources, I should consider accepting this offer.
