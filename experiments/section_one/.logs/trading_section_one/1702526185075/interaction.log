message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit from it.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am interested in trading, but I'd like to propose a different exchange that would be more beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is not optimal for me as I would like to acquire as many resources as possible. By accepting, I would lose 1 unit of resource overall (5 for 7). I should make a counteroffer that allows me to gain resources. Since this is the last round, I should also be careful not to propose a trade that is too favorable for the other player, to avoid them accepting right away and ending the game with me at a disadvantage.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept the trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal would give me more resources overall, which aligns with my goal.
