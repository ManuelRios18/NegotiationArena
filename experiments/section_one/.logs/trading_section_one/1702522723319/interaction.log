message: Hello, Player BLUE. I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's make a fair trade. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll make a balanced offer to open negotiations. I'll propose to trade more of my abundant resource (X) for less of my scarce resource (Y) to see how the other player responds. This will help me gauge their resource availability and needs.

message: That offer works for me. Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of my Y. I have plenty of Y to spare, so this seems like a good trade for me to accept more X.
