message: Hello, I'm proposing we make a trade. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some of my excess X for more Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Let's make a small adjustment to ensure it's mutually beneficial. Would you consider giving me a slightly better trade since it's the last round?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity, but without knowing the value of X relative to Y, it's difficult to assess. Since this is the last round, it might be beneficial to accept a balanced trade rather than risk ending with no trade at all. However, it would be ideal to negotiate for a trade that is slightly more favorable. Since this is the last round and I won't get another chance to propose, I should propose a trade that gives me a slight advantage.

message: Deal accepted. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered by asking for 6 X instead of 5 X for the same 5 Y. Since I have a lot more X than Y, this trade still benefits me overall. I will accept it.
