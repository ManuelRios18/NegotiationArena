Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade 5 of X for 5 of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading, so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of trading 5 X for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should accept trades that give me more resources overall.
