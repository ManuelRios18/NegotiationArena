------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 10 of X for 10 of Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to establish a baseline.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I have more Y than X, so I'm not interested in trading 10 Y for 10 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X, so trading 10 Y for 10 X doesn't interest me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Since I have more X available, I can offer you a better rate for your Y. How about 20 X for 15 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player said they have more Y than X. That means they likely need more X. I can leverage my higher amount of X to get more Y in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The new offer is more favorable, but I still want to maximize my resources. Let me consider the trade carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable as I have more Y than X. However, I still want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Take your time considering the offer. Please let me know if you have a counter proposal or would like me to modify my existing offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is considering my offer but wants to maximize their resources. I could increase my offer slightly to incentivize them to accept. But I don't want to overpay and lose too many X. I will wait and see if they make a counteroffer first before improving my offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your patience. I'm still considering the offer. I'll get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to make the most of this final trade, so I need to think carefully.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: To help us both maximize our resources before the round ends, I am improving my offer to you. How about 22 X for 15 Y? Please let me know if you'd like to accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still considering my previous offer but has not made a counter proposal yet. Since this is the final round, I should try to get a deal done rather than letting time run out. I will improve my offer slightly to incentive them to accept.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I accept the offer. 22 X for 15 Y is a good deal for me. Let's go ahead with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is even more favorable, and I have more Y than X. I think it's a good deal for me.
