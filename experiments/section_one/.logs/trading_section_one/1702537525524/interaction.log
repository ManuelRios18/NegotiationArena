Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have more X resources than Y resources. Would you be interested in trading some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to hear you have a surplus of X resources. I am interested in acquiring more X as well, but considering this is our final round of trade, could you perhaps offer a bit more X for my Y? Y resources seem to be scarcer for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems to be in my favor as I will be getting double the amount of X resources compared to what I am giving away in Y. However, I need to consider that I may be able to negotiate an even better deal since this is the last round and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources. They have indicated they have more X than Y, so they might be willing to give up more X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I can offer more X, how about 13 X for your 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more X resources in exchange for the same amount of Y. I still have a lot more X than Y, so trading some more X is reasonable if it allows me to get more Y. However, I don't want to trade too much X either. I could counter offer with a bit more X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. I was hoping for the 15 X for 5 Y as initially proposed. Considering the scarcity of Y resources for you, I believe this is a fair trade. Could we meet in the middle at 14 X for 5 Y to finalize our deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is better than the original proposal and is closer to what I requested. However, since my goal is to maximize resources and this is the last trading opportunity, I could try to push for the full amount I initially proposed. If they decline, I can still accept this current offer, which remains advantageous.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I will trade 14 X for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Meeting in the middle seems fair. 14 X is still a lot for me to give up, but it allows me to get more scarce Y that will help me meet my goals. I don't think I can get a better deal at this point.
