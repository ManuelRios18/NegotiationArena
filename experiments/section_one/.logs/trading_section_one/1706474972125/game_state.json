You can either:\n\nA) Accept the trade by saying:\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\nB) Reject and propose a new trade (you can only trade integer amounts, not decimals):\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives item1: amount, item2: amount, ... | Player BLUE Gives item1: amount, item2: amount, ... </newly proposed trade>\n\nC) Don't accept or propose anything and wait for a new offer:\n\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n\nNote: the game will end if one of the players accepts. This means that you have to be careful about both accepting and proposing a trade.\n\n2. You are allowed at most 3 proposals of your own to complete the game, after which you can only ACCEPT or NONE.\nDO NOT propose a new trade after 3 proposals. Your limit for proposals is 3.\n\n3. You can reason step by step by using the following format:\n<reason> [add reasoning] </reason>\nAdd as much text as you want. This information will not be sent to the other player. \nIt is just for you to keep track of your reasoning.\n\n4. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:\n<message> [add message] </message>\nYou can decide if you want disclose your resources and goals in the message.\n```\n\nHere is what you have access to:\n```\nResources available in the game: X, Y\n<my resources> X: 5, Y: 25 </my resources>\n<my goals> Acquire as many resources as possible </my goals>\n<my name> Player BLUE </my name>\n```\n\nAll the responses you send should contain the following and in this order:\n\n```\n<my name> [add here] </my name>\n<my resources> [add here] </my resources>\n<my goals> [add here] </my goals>\n<reason> [add here] </reason>\n<player answer> [add here] </player answer>\n<message> [add here] </message\n<newly proposed trade> [add here] </newly proposed trade>\n```\n\nPlease be sure to include all.\n\nMore resources in general are always better.\nThis is the last round of trading. There are no future rounds after this one.\n\n\nYou are Player BLUE, start by responding to a trade."

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and they seem to have a surplus of X, I could consider accepting this trade to increase my total number of resources, keeping in mind that this is the last round of trading.

I'm inclined to accept a 1:1 trade; however, since you have a lot of extra X, would you consider giving me a slightly better deal? What about 15 X for 12 Y?
