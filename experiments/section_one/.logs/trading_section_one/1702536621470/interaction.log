message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 units of X for 3 units of Y. Please let me know if this interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I am interested in trading but I would like a little more Y for my X. Could you offer 4 or 5 units of Y instead of 3? Let me know, thanks!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 3 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give up 3 units, but I'm not sure if this is a fair trade or if I could get more Y for my X.

message: Hello, I can increase my offer to 4 units of Y instead of 3. Let me know if you'd like to trade 5 units of my X for 4 units of your Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has revealed they have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. They have a lot more Y than me and are interested in getting more Y. I could increase my offer to 4 or 5 units of Y to entice them to accept. But since this is the last round, I don't necessarily need to trade. I'll counter offer with 4 units of Y instead of 3 and see if they accept.

message: Thank you for increasing your offer Player RED. I accept trading my 5 units of X for your 4 units of Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 4 units of Y for 5 units of my X. I'm willing to accept this trade since Y is more valuable to me and 4 Y is a good amount for 5 X based on what I have.
