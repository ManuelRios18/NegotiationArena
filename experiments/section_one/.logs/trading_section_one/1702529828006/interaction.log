message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 X for 2 Y. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

message: This trade seems fair to me; let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and I have to make it count. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider the value of the trade. The other player proposes to trade 5 X resources for 2 Y resources. Without knowledge of the relative value or scarcity of X and Y, it is difficult to make a perfectly informed decision. However, since I have a larger amount of Y and the trade is a 2.5:1 ratio, it seems reasonable to assume that Y might be less valuable or more abundant than X. Therefore, accepting this trade might be beneficial as it would increase the diversity of my resources and could potentially be a good deal if X is indeed more valuable or scarce.
