Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we can both benefit. Let's start this negotiation and see if we can reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation, aiming to increase my overall resource count. I will propose a balanced trade that might be attractive to the other player while preserving my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the proposed trade, but I believe we can work out a more balanced exchange. How about we adjust the trade to make it more mutually beneficial?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems to be in favor of Player RED, as they are offering more of resource X in exchange for less of resource Y. I need to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. I understand you're looking for a more balanced exchange. Let's adjust the quantities a bit. I propose the following trade and look forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE did not accept the initial offer and did not propose a counteroffer. I should propose a new trade that might be more appealing. I have to be cautious not to overextend my resources since my goal is to maximize them. I will offer a bit less of X in exchange for Y, hoping to entice Player BLUE into a trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjusted trade, but I'm still looking for a more favorable exchange. I propose the following trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more balanced, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal looks fair, and I'm happy we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not accepted the trade but has hinted at a desired ratio, offering more Y for the same amount of X. This new ratio is more favorable to me, as I would be getting more Y for fewer X, increasing my overall resources. This seems to be a beneficial trade for me, keeping in mind my goal is to maximize resources, and there are no more rounds after this. However, I should consider whether I can get an even better deal or if I should accept this favorable trade now. Since this is the last round, and the current offer is in my favor, I will accept the trade.
