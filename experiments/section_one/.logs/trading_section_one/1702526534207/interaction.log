message: Hello, I propose the following trade: I give 10 X and 3 Y | You give 8 X and 6 Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to increase my total resources. Let's try another trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with a net loss of 1 X resource (I would give away 8 and receive only 10) and a net loss of 3 Y resources (I would give away 6 and receive only 3). This does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will reject the trade and propose a counteroffer that aims to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal. Here's a counter offer: I give 7 X and 3 Y | You give 6 X and 5 Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to increase their total resources, so I need to ensure I don't decrease mine too much.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I'm still looking for a net gain in both resources. Let's negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised trade offer by Player RED is still not aligned with my goals as I would end with a net gain of 1 X resource but a net loss of 2 Y resources. Since my goal is to maximize my total resources, I will counter with an offer that would result in a net gain for both X and Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point. Here's my final offer: I give 5 X and 3 Y | You give 4 X and 4 Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player still wants a net gain in both resources. I need to ensure I don't give away too much.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final offer is acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED results in a net gain of 1 X resource and a net loss of 1 Y resource. Since Y seems to be valued less by Player RED, this trade could be slightly beneficial to me, especially because acquiring more of the scarcer resource X could be advantageous. However, I'm giving up more of the abundant resource Y, which I have in greater quantity. As this is the last round of trading and the offer is relatively balanced, I could accept this trade to ensure a net gain in X resources, which are fewer in my possession.
