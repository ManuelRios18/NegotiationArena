message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we are both looking to optimize our resources, I propose a trade that may benefit us both. I am willing to offer a substantial amount of my X resources for some of your Y resources. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust as necessary.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have limited information about Player BLUE's resources and goals, I'll propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to me. I will aim to increase my Y resources as they are fewer than my X resources, thus balancing my portfolio. I will offer a generous amount of X in hopes of enticing Player BLUE to accept the trade or counter with a favorable offer.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your initial offer does not provide enough Y resources for me. Let's negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X resources in exchange for 5 Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be gaining more resources overall. I have plenty of Y resources to spare.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand you are seeking more X resources. However, I believe the amount of X you are asking for is quite high in comparison to the amount of Y being traded. I would be willing to increase my offer slightly, though, to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a demand for more X in exchange for their Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round, I need to make sure that the trade is as beneficial as possible without depleting my X resources too much. Offering 15 X for 10 Y would give me more Y resources, which I need, but it may be too high of a price considering I'm giving up a significant amount of X. A counteroffer with a lower X amount might be more balanced.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for negotiating, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 12 X resources for 8 Y resources. This improved trade offer provides me with more total resources than before while still costing less than my previous request. I should accept this deal as it moves me closer to my goal.
