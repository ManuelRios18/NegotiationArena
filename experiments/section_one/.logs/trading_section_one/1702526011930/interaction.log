message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I propose the following trade: I give 10 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of X and 5 units of Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that would increase my total number of resources. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. I would lose 2 units overall (give 5X+5Y and get 10X+3Y). Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that increases my total number of resources. I have to consider that this is the last round and I can only make three proposals, so I should make a counteroffer that is fair but also advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I'm looking to increase my resources as well. How about this: I give 12 units of X and 4 units of Y in exchange for 7 units of X and 6 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counteroffer is not favorable to me as it would decrease my total resources. I need to propose a new trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for your proposal. However, I'm still looking to increase my overall resources. Let's find a balanced trade that benefits us both. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new proposal still has me giving up more resources than I receive. The net change would be a loss of 3 resources for me (I give away 7X+6Y and get 12X+4Y). This is not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should either propose a new trade or accept one that gives me a net gain in resources. Since it's the last round, I should make a trade that is clearly beneficial for me, but also seems fair to the other player to encourage acceptance.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal, but I also need to maximize my resources. Here's my final proposal: I give 15 units of X and 5 units of Y in exchange for 8 units of X and 7 units of Y. This trade will benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counteroffer is still not favorable to me as it would decrease my total resources. I need to propose a new trade that benefits me. This is my last opportunity to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final proposal works for me. It aligns with my goal to maximize my resources. I accept this trade, thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Evaluating Player RED's final proposal, it would result in a net gain of 5 units of X and a loss of 2 units of Y for me. Since I have a surplus of Y and am looking to increase my total resources, this trade is beneficial as it gives me a net gain of 3 resources overall. Given that it's the last round, accepting a trade with a net gain is in line with my goals.
