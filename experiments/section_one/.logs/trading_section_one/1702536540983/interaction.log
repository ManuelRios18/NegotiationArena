message: Hello! I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Before I can decide, could you please let me know what resources you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I don't know what resources the other player has. I should try to gather more information before making a decision.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have more X than Y available to trade. I'm looking to trade some X for whatever you have the most of. What kinds of resources and amounts are you willing to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has asked about my resources before responding to my trade offer. I said my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, so I don't want to fully disclose what I have. But I can reveal some information to build some trust and get the negotiations moving.

message: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I am willing to trade some of my Y for your X. Could you make an offer of how much X you can trade and how much Y you would want in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more X than Y and wants to trade some X for whatever I have the most of. I have more Y than X. I could propose trading some of my Y for their X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You have more Y than me. I can offer 10 X if you give me 15 Y. Does that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player has 5 X and 25 Y. Since I have a lot of X already, getting more Y would be useful to diversify my resources. I'll propose trading 10 of my X for 15 of their Y.

Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 X for 15 Y. I have 25 Y to spare so this seems like a good trade for me to get more total resources.
