message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that might benefit us both. Let's start the negotiations and see where we end up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial offer that is beneficial to me but also reasonable enough that the other player might consider it. I want to propose a trade that gives me more of one type of resource while giving away some of another, maintaining a balance that seems fair.

message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your initial offer, as I believe 15 units of Y is too much for only 10 units of X. However, I am open to negotiating a fair trade that benefits us both. Perhaps you could offer a bit more X? Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your point of view, but giving away too much of my X resource is not ideal for me. How about we trade a more balanced amount? I propose the following.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal suggests that Player BLUE values Y highly or has a scarcity of X. Since this is a strategic game and giving away a large number of my X resources could weaken my position, I'd like to counter with a slightly more balanced offer. I want to suggest a trade that is closer to a one-to-one ratio, which still allows me to increase my Y resources without depleting too much of my X.

message: Thank you Player RED, I accept your offer of 12 units of X for 10 units of my Y. This will benefit us both. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 12 units of X for 10 units of my Y. This seems more reasonable. I would be gaining 7 more units of X while only losing 10 units of Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade helps me do that.
