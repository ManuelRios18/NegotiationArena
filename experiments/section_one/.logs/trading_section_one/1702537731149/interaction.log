message: Hello! I have extra resource X and am hoping to trade some for more Y. Please let me know if you're interested!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 3 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in trading Y for X. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that might work better for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems to be in my favor as I am giving away less Y than I am receiving in X. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I should try to propose a counteroffer that still benefits me but might be more appealing to the other player. This could potentially lead to a better trade for me without reaching the maximum of 3 proposals too quickly.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I would prefer 3 Y if possible. Could we meet in the middle at 4 X for 2 Y? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with giving only 2 Y instead of 3 Y. I still think 3 Y is fair for 5 X. However, since this is the last round, I want to try to make a deal instead of reaching an impasse. I could compromise by adjusting my offer to 4 X for 2 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair trade. I accept your offer of 4 X for 2 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal given by Player RED still seems beneficial to me. By trading 2 Y for 4 X I am getting double the amount of X for each unit of Y. Given that my goal is to maximize my resource pool and both X and Y are valuable to me, accepting this trade would increase my total resources and provide a favorable exchange rate. I will accept this trade as it aligns with my goals and leaves room for potential future negotiations if the game were to continue.
