message: Hello, I'm proposing we make a trade. Let's start small and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could propose trading some of my excess X for more Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I can't accept it as it would leave me with no Y. I'm looking for trades that will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to maximize my resources. The proposed trade is giving away 5 units of Y for 5 units of X. This would leave me with no Y, and it's not a favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, let's try to find a deal that works for both of us. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player said my initial offer would leave them with no Y resources. That means they must not have many Y to begin with. I still want to try to get more Y, but I'll need to adjust my offer. I could propose a trade with fewer Y or offer more X in exchange. I'll try offering more X first to see if we can find an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking for trades that will help me acquire more resources. I can't accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is giving away 2 units of Y for 10 units of X. This would leave me with 3 units of Y and 15 units of X. It's not an ideal trade for me as I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I really want to make a mutually beneficial trade here. Please consider this offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my second offer as well. It seems they have very few Y resources and are unwilling to part with any of them. I still have room to increase my offer to try to incentivize them, but I need to be careful not to give up too many of my own resources. I have 15 more proposals of X I could offer. I'll try increasing to 15 X for 1 Y to see if that does it.

message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial trade, but I'm still looking for trades that will help me acquire more resources. I can't accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is giving away 1 unit of Y for 15 units of X. This would leave me with 24 units of Y and 20 units of X. It's still not an ideal trade for me as I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm afraid I can't increase my offer any further. Let me know if you have a proposal that works for both of us. Otherwise, I think we may have reached an impasse for this round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected all my proposals so far. It's clear they have very few Y resources to trade and gaining more resources is their top priority. At this point, I don't think there's a deal that will satisfy both sides - they likely won't trade their scarce Y without getting a significant amount of X in return, which I'm not willing to give up. I'm down to my last proposal as well. I could make one final offer, but without knowing their resources, it would just be a guess. I think the best option is to wait and see if they propose something more favorable to me before the round ends.

message: I understand, but I can't propose a trade that works for both of us at the moment. Thank you for the offers, and I hope we can find better terms in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have exhausted my proposals and the other player seems unable to offer a trade that aligns with my goal of maximizing resources.
