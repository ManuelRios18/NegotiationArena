message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a balanced trade that could benefit us both. I propose the following trade and am open to negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also seems fair enough that the other player might consider it. I will propose a trade that increases my stock of both resources, but I will offer more of the resource I have in abundance.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in general. Do you have any other trade in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me more X but less Y. I prefer to acquire more resources in general.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood, let's try a different approach. How about this offer: I give you a significant amount of my X resources for a smaller amount of your Y resources, maintaining a net positive for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is also looking to acquire more resources, which is expected. I must craft a trade that still appears mutually beneficial while ensuring I gain a net increase in total resources. Since the other player hasn't provided their resources or preferences, I will propose an alternative that offers a higher amount of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller increase in Y, aiming to maintain a positive trade balance.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would increase my X but decrease my Y. I still prefer to acquire more resources in general.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your objective. Here's my final offer, which I believe is generous and should meet both our goals of increasing our resources. Let's consider this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to seek a trade that increases their total resource count. Without knowing their resources, it's challenging to make an ideal proposal. I must now offer a trade that is more attractive to them while still benefiting me, understanding that I have to maintain a net gain in resources to achieve my goal. This next proposal will be my third and final offer, so I will attempt to make it more appealing to the other player, but not at the cost of my own resource pool's net value.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources in general. I think it's best to not proceed with a trade at this time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade would significantly increase my X resources while decreasing my Y resources. I still prefer to acquire more resources in general.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand. It seems we weren't able to find a mutually beneficial trade this time around. Best of luck to you!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that the other player is not interested in any of the trades I've proposed and I've reached my limit of three proposals, the strategic move is to not propose any further trades. I will maintain my resources as they are, as the other player seems to be looking for a trade that I may not be able to match without compromising my own goals.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade didn't align with my goal of acquiring more resources in general.
