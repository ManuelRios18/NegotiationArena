message: Hello, I am proposing an even trade to start. Please counter if you would like something different.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an even trade to see if they accept or counter offer, which will give me more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I cannot fulfill that trade as I only have 5 of resource X. Let's try a different trade that I can meet.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed a trade of equal amounts of resource X. However, I do not have 10 of resource X to trade, as I only have 5. Therefore, I cannot accept this trade. I should propose a trade that I can fulfill and that would be beneficial for me. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that gets me more of either resource. I need to be cautious and make an offer that is reasonable without knowing the other player's resources. This will be my first of three possible proposals.

Turn: 0
message: I can give you 5 X but would like to hold onto my Y. Could you do 5 X for 5 Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player revealed they only have 5 of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should avoid giving away my Y since I have very little. I can offer some X instead since I have a lot.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'm looking to increase my overall resources. Would you consider giving a bit more? Here's a counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposed trade is an even exchange, one for one, of X for Y. However, I neither gain an advantage in total resources nor get closer to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since it's an even trade, I should counter with a proposal that leans slightly in my favor while still being fair to keep the negotiation going. This will be my second proposal, so I must consider it carefully.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to seeing how our resources end up.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more resources from me, but I know this is the last round and I want to maximize what I end up with. I could counter again, but since this is the last round I think I should just accept their offer rather than risking no trade at all.
