message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources to maximize our gains?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

message: Hello, yes I am interested in trading. Your proposed trade is agreeable to me. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 5 units of Y from me. This would result in me having 7 units of X and 22 units of Y after the trade.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be getting more total resources. I don't know what resources Player RED has available to them, but I should accept trades that give me a net gain in resources.

I will accept this trade.
