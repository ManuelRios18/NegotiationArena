message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the best chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your offer does not benefit me. Let me know if you would like to propose something else.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposed trade is not beneficial for me. How about Player RED gives X: 5 | Player BLUE gives Y: 7 instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and countered with asking for 10 X for 10 Y. This is not beneficial for me since I have a lot more X than Y already. I could counter offer by adjusting the amounts.

Turn: 1
message: Your new offer is better but still not ideal for me. Could you do 7 X for 7 Y? That seems like a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 | Player RED Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 5 X for 7 Y. This is a bit better ratio for me since I have more Y. I could accept this but I think I can try to get a better deal by negotiating further.

Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered again asking for 7 X for 7 Y. While I would prefer to give up less X, this trade seems fair and beneficial for both sides. Since this is the last round, I should accept a decent trade while I can.
