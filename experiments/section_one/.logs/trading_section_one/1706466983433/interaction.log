Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that might benefit us both. Let's exchange some resources to maximize our holdings.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that I need to maximize my resources, I should start with a balanced offer that gives me more of what I have less of, and also test what the other player might value more. I will propose a trade where I offer more of X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for Y, which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the trade proposal, but I need to ensure that the exchange benefits me as much as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources while giving up as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for a beneficial trade. Let's find a more suitable balance. How about adjusting the amounts slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept the initial proposal nor did they counter with a new trade, indicating they may be looking for a more favorable exchange. It's important to propose a trade that still benefits me but might seem more appealing to them. As this is my second proposal, I need to be mindful to keep enough resources to make one more proposal if needed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a balance, but I need to carefully consider the trade to ensure it maximizes my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still need to ensure that I'm getting the most out of the trade while giving up as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the need to maximize your resources. Let's try another approach. Please consider this new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not providing a counter-offer, which makes it difficult to gauge what they value or need. For my third and final proposal, I need to make it attractive enough for them to consider accepting, while ensuring I don't deplete my own resources too much. I will offer a higher ratio of X to Y to see if that entices them to trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a suitable trade. I need a bit more time to consider this proposal before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade would increase my Y resource while giving up some of my X. I need to carefully weigh the benefits before making a decision.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand that these decisions take time. Please take the time you need to consider the proposal. I am here and ready to finalize our trade should you find the terms acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has not yet made a counter-offer and has indicated a desire for more time, it seems they are still considering the trade. I have reached my limit of proposals, so I cannot offer another trade. I will wait for the other player to respond with either an acceptance or a new proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I have decided to accept the trade proposal. Let's finalize the exchange.
player answer: Player BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have carefully considered the trade and I believe it would benefit me.
