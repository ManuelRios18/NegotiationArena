Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing that we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to explore other trade options that could potentially benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 X and 25 Y, and my goal is to acquire more resources. I could potentially benefit from diversifying my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Since I have more X resources available, I can offer 10 X in exchange for 7 Y if that works for you. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my initial trade offer but seems open to negotiating. I still don't know what resources they have. I will propose trading more of my abundant resource X in exchange for more of Y since I am low on Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering the offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer is to exchange 10 X for 7 Y, which would leave me with 18 Y and 5 X. This would help diversify my resources and bring me closer to my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I am willing to trade 15 X for 10 Y if that works for you. If not, please make a counteroffer and we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to want a more equal trade. Since this is the last round, I should propose a trade I am willing to accept to guarantee I end up with more resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can still find a more mutually beneficial agreement. I will counteroffer with a trade proposal that could potentially benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer is to exchange 15 X for 10 Y, which would leave me with 5 X and 15 Y. This would significantly diversify my resources and bring me closer to my goal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your offer as it provides me with more of the resource I am lacking.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed trading some of my scarce resource Y for their X. This helps me acquire more Y which I need. I gain a net of 5 Y by accepting. This is likely the best offer I will get since they know I need Y, so I will accept.
