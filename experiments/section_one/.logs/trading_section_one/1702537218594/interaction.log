message: Hello! Let's trade resources. I have more X resources and am looking for Y resources. Please propose a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am interested in trading some of my Y resources for your X resources. However, I am unsure how many X resources you have available to trade. Let's start with this offer and negotiate further if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. Since I have more Y resources, I could potentially trade some Y for X and still meet my goal of acquiring more total resources. However, I don't know how many X or Y resources Player RED has. I'll propose trading 3 of my Y resources for 5 of their X resources to see if they accept. If not, I can negotiate further.

message: I have plenty of X resources to trade. Let's do 5 X resources for 4 Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in my X resources but is starting with a lower offer of 3 Y resources. Since I have plenty of X to spare, I could accept this trade or try to negotiate for more Y. I'll counter offer with a trade of 5 X for 4 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the additional X resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they have plenty of X resources and countered my offer by proposing to trade 5 X resources for 4 of my Y resources. This seems like a fair trade that will allow me to acquire more total resources while giving up fewer of my Y resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I will accept this trade.
