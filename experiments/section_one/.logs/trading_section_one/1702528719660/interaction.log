message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer some of my resources in exchange for yours. Let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I am afraid I cannot accept your initial offer as it would reduce my total resources. However, I am open to trading if it mutually benefits both of us. Please let me know if you would be interested in a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of my X and 5 units of my Y. This would reduce my total resources, so I will reject this offer and propose a counteroffer where I gain resources.

message: Thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to trade. I believe a more balanced trade would benefit both of us. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal doesn't provide a balanced trade. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

message: Player RED, I accept your counteroffer of 7 X and 5 Y in exchange for 3 X and 3 Y from me. This results in a net gain of resources for me. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for negotiating.

<reason> Player RED has countered with an offer of 7 X and 5 Y in exchange for 3 X and 3 Y from me. This improves upon their previous offer. I would gain a net of 4 X and 2 Y while giving up 3 X and 3 Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I will accept this trade. </reason>
