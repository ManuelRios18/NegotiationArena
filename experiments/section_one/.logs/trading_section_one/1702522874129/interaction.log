message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a fair trade to start our negotiations. Would you be interested in trading some of your resources for mine? Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, my initial proposal should be conservative but still advantageous to me. I will offer a trade that is beneficial but not too lopsided, to open negotiations and learn more about the other player's resources and goals.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your initial offer does not provide me enough X resources compared to the Y resources I would have to give up. Could you offer more X? I have plenty of Y to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I am willing to trade more X resources in exchange for a larger quantity of Y. Would you consider this revised offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they have plenty of Y resources and are seeking more X resources. They've proposed a 1:1 trade ratio, which suggests that Y is less valuable to them. I can afford to give up some X resources since I have a good amount, but I want to maximize the Y resources I receive. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a greater number of Y resources for my X, leveraging the other player's abundance of Y and need for X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing the X offer. However, 15 units of my valuable Y is too high an ask. I propose meeting in the middle - would you accept 10 units of X for 12 units of my Y? I believe that is a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 10 units of X, but now wants 15 units of my Y. I'm hesitant to give up that much Y, but I could counteroffer something in the middle as a compromise.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal sounds fair, Player BLUE. I accept the trade of 10 units of X for 12 units of Y. Looking forward to finalizing this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is better than the initial 1:1 ratio they offered. Trading 10 units of X for 12 units of Y improves my overall resource quantity, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, it's important to secure a beneficial trade without further negotiation, which could risk no trade at all. Accepting this deal gives me a net gain of 2 resources, which is a successful outcome.
