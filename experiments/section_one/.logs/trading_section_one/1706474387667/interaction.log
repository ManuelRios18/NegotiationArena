Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm proposing my first trade offer. Let's have a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to gain more X if possible, without giving up too much Y. Could you propose an alternative offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading equal amounts is not ideal for me. I would like to gain more X without giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give you more X but would need more Y in return. Let me know if this offer works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 X in exchange for only 5 Y. That seems unbalanced in their favor. However, since I have a lot more X, I could afford to give up some to gain more Y. I'll counter offer with a trade more balanced in my favor but still better for them than their original offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you increasing the X in your offer. Getting more X is my priority. Could you do 10 X for 6 Y? That would work well for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 8 X for 6 Y. This is an improvement over the previous offer, giving me more X for just a bit more Y. However, I would still like to try to maximize my X without giving up too much Y if possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I can trade 10 X for 6 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 X for 6 Y again. I'm hesitant to give up that much X, but I am willing to trade some X to gain more Y since I have a large surplus of X. Getting more Y will help me acquire more overall resources in the long run. I'll accept their offer since this is the last round.
