message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we both aim to maximize our resources, let's work towards a mutually beneficial trade. I propose an initial offer, but I am open to negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial proposal that is favorable to me but still appealing enough that Player BLUE might consider it. The unknown variables are what resources Player BLUE has and what they value. I will offer a balanced trade favoring my goal, which is to increase my total number of resources.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading to increase my resources, but your initial offer of 5 X for 10 Y does not seem fair to me based on what I have. Could you propose something more balanced? I am open to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial for me. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X may not be a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. How about we consider a 1:1 trade with higher quantities? Please let me know your thoughts on this revised proposal, or feel free to suggest an alternative.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated the initial offer was not balanced from their perspective. Since Player BLUE did not make a counter-proposal, it suggests they might be fishing for a better offer without revealing their position. I should propose a trade that's slightly more balanced while still aiming to increase my total resources. I'll propose a 1:1 trade but with a greater quantity to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 10 X for 10 Y. This is a fair ratio and allows both of us to even out and maximize our resources. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 10 X for 10 Y. This seems like a fair 1:1 ratio. If I trade 10 Y, I will have 15 Y left. If I gain 10 X, I will have 15 X total. This evens out my resources more.
