message: Hello! Let's make a fair trade so we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 2 Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I already have enough X. I'm looking for ways to maximize my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I already have 5 units of X, so I don't need more of that. I want to maximize my resources, so I need to consider what I can offer that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know what you'd be interested in trading for some of my extra X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Any: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading for more X. Since I don't know what resources they have, I'll make a more general offer to trade some of my excess X for whatever they have more of. I'll increase the amount of X offered to try to make it more appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, but I need to be more specific about what I'm looking for. How about we trade X for Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I can't trade "Any" for X, I need to be specific about what I want to receive.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I can trade some X for Y. Let me know how much Y you'd be willing to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in trading for my X in order to get more Y. Since I don't have very much Y, I could propose trading some X for whatever Y they have. I still have 15 proposals left so I can make a few more offers if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking to acquire more resources overall, so I'm not interested in trading 3 Y for 7 X. Is there another trade you'd be open to?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 3 Y for 7 X would leave me with less Y, so it doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand, let's try to find a trade that benefits both of us. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in my proposed trade of X for Y. They want to maximize their overall resources. I still don't know what resources they have. I could offer more X for less Y to see if that interests them.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering the trade, let me think for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I can trade 2 Y for 10 X, which would give me more X resources, but I'd have less Y. I need to carefully consider if this trade aligns with my goal.
