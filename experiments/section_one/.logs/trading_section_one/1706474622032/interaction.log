Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade of resources to get things started. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading but would like to see if we can agree on a trade that allows me to gain more resources. Please let me know your thoughts on the offer below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an equal trade of 5 units of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more resources than I give up.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello. While I'm open to trading, your proposed offer would result in a net loss of resources for me. I would be interested in a trade that is more equal in value. Could you please make another offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 X resources while only offering 3 X and 5 Y in return. This is not an equal trade and I would be losing resources overall. However, I only have 3 chances to propose a trade myself before I can only accept or reject. I will try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you coming back with another offer. However, I am still hoping we can agree on a trade that allows me to gain more total resources. Please let me know your thoughts on the following proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a perfectly equal trade of 5 X and 3 Y resources each. This would result in no net gain of resources for me. I still have 2 more chances to propose a trade before I have to either accept or wait. I will try proposing an unequal trade in my favor again, but offer more Y resources this time to see if it interests Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm aiming for a fair trade that allows both of us to gain resources. Let me know if you have another offer in mind that can achieve that. Otherwise, I can wait for your next proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered again asking for 10 of my valuable X resources while only offering 3 X and 10 Y. Looking at the value to me, 10 X is worth more than 3 X and 10 Y since X is my most abundant resource. I could counter offer again but I'm down to 2 proposals. At this point, I think my best option is to wait and see if they offer something more equitable on their next turn before using another proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I understand you are looking for a fair trade. As this is my last chance to propose a trade, I want to see if you are willing to accept the following offer which lands in between my previous two proposals:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is looking for a fair trade but I still want to try to gain more resources. This is my last chance to propose a trade before I have to start accepting deals or waiting. I will propose a trade right in the middle of my previous two offers and see if Player RED will accept.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have decided to accept your last proposed trade, although it favors you more in terms of net resources gained. As this is the final round, some additional resources for both of us is better than no trade at all. Thanks for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In their latest offer, the other player is still asking for 10 of my valuable X resources, while improving their offer to 3 X and 7 Y. While better than their previous offer, I believe this still results in a net loss for me since X is my most abundant resource. However, this is their last chance to propose a trade. If I reject it, we may end up with no trade at all, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring the most resources possible. I think at this point, even though it is not an equivalent trade, some additional resources are better than none.
