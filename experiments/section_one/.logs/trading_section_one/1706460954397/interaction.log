message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. I'm interested in balancing my resources a bit more. Would you be interested in a trade where I give you some of my X for some of your Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will attempt to make a balanced offer that benefits both sides while trying to increase my resources. I will propose a trade where I give more of the resource I have in abundance in exchange for the one I have less of.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but I think we could come to an even better arrangement that benefits us both more. What do you think about if you give me 15 X and I give you 3 Y? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 5 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be gaining more resources overall. However, I don't know what resources Player RED has available. I could try to negotiate to get an even better trade in my favor.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I feel that the proposed exchange rate is not quite balanced. I would like to propose a different ratio that I believe is fairer for both of us. How about I give you a bit less X and in return, you give me a bit more Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE seems to undervalue my X resource in comparison to their Y. I would be giving up too much X for too little Y. Hence, I should counter with a more balanced trade that still aims to increase my total resources.

message: Deal accepted! I look forward to trading with you again.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 12 X for 4 Y. This is still a good trade for me resource-wise. I could try to get a little more but I don't want to risk Player RED walking away. I think I will accept this offer.
