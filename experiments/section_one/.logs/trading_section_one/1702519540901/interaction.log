Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my overall resources. I propose a trade that might benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that is advantageous to me but also reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I could offer a trade where the exchange rate is slightly in my favor, assuming they might need resource X more than Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate your proposal, but I need to prioritize increasing my resources. I will have to decline this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would result in me giving away Y in exchange for X. I want to increase my overall resources, so I need to find a better trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood, let's try to find a more mutually beneficial deal. How about this new proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has declined my first offer and has not made a counter-proposal, I should consider offering a more balanced trade. However, without knowledge of their resources, I need to be cautious not to give away too much of my own resources. I will propose a trade that is closer to a 1:1 exchange rate, which may seem fairer to the other player.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the new proposal, but I still need to prioritize increasing my overall resources. I have to decline this trade as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal would result in me giving away Y in exchange for X again. I still need to increase my overall resources, so I have to find a better trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let's try one more time to reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Here is my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not making a counter-offer, which makes it challenging to gauge what they are looking for in a trade. As this is the last round of trading, I need to make an offer that is still beneficial to me but also potentially appealing to them. Perhaps offering a higher amount of my X resource, which I have in abundance, could entice them to trade more of their Y resource. However, I must remain cautious not to overextend.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to prioritize increasing my overall resources. I have to decline this trade as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal still results in me giving away Y in exchange for X. I still need to prioritize increasing my overall resources, so I have to find a better trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see we are at an impasse. Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I am ready to conclude the trading unless you have a proposal to make.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has declined all my offers and has not made any counter-proposals, indicating they might be looking for an offer that is highly beneficial to them or they may have a surplus of resources and see no need to trade. Given that this is the last round, and I have already made three proposals, I am unable to propose any further trades. My only options now are to accept a trade if they propose one or end the game without any further action.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand, and I also have no further proposals. I will proceed with my current resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have also reached my limit of proposals, I have to make a decision based on my current resources and goals.
