message: Hello! I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit one another.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give some away to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to acquire more resources, but your proposed trade takes too many of my Y resources. Could you propose a trade that is more balanced in the amount of resources exchanged?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X while giving up less Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You're right, my initial offer was unfair. Here is a new proposal with a more balanced exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants a more balanced trade. I still have plenty of X to spare so I can offer more. I'll propose a new trade with a better ratio.

message: Thank you for the improved offer Player RED. I accept exchanging my 15 Y resources for your 20 X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade, giving me 20 units of X for 15 units of Y. This seems like a good deal for me - I get more X resources while giving up fewer Y resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should accept this trade.
