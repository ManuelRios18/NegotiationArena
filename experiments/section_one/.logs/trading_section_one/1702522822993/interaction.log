message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer a balanced trade to start the discussion. Let me know your thoughts and what you're looking for.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a balanced initial offer to open up negotiation. I don't know what resources the other player has, but offering a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering some of the other might be enticing to them if they value one resource over the other.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but would like to get more Y resources if possible since I am low on those. Could you offer 3 Y instead of 2?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 5 X and 5 Y from me. I have 5 X and 25 Y. This seems like a decent starting offer that would give me a net gain of 5 X and lose 3 Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I should try to gain more Y if possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, your counterproposal sounds fair to me. I'm happy to trade 3 Y in exchange for 5 X and 5 Y, as it will help us both reach our respective goals. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has expressed a need for more Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider their request carefully. They've asked for one more Y than I initially offered, which is a reasonable request. However, I must ensure that I'm still gaining a good number of resources in return. Accepting their proposal would get me a balanced increase in both X and Y, which aligns with my goals.
