message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources since this is the last chance. Please let me know if you'd be interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources, so I can't accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 units of Y for 5 units of X would not benefit me as I already have 5 units of X and I want to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me increase my offer. How about 10 X resources for 5 Y resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer and did not provide any information about their resources. Since they said they are looking to acquire more resources, I could try offering more X resources to entice them. I still have plenty of X to spare.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 units of Y for 10 units of X would benefit me as it would increase my overall resources.
