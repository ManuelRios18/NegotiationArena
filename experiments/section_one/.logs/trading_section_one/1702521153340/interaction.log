message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade where I can offer you some of my X in exchange for your Y. This could be beneficial for both of us. Let's find a balance that we both can agree on.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make a proposal that is slightly in my favor to start the negotiation process. Since I have a good amount of X and a limited amount of Y, I will propose a trade that gives me some Y while offering a reasonable amount of X in return. This will open up the dialogue and give me a better understanding of the other player's resources and needs.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading for some of your X. However, 5 Y seems like too much for me to give up right now without knowing more about what you have. Let's start with a smaller trade first to build some trust.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X in exchange for 5 Y from me. I have 5 X and 25 Y. Acquiring more X could be beneficial for me. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has. I'll propose a counter offer where I give less Y.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need to start with a smaller trade. How about we adjust the numbers slightly? I'm willing to give you 10 X for 4 Y, which I believe is a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counteroffer, suggesting a smaller trade of 10 X for 3 Y. This is a sign that they are cautious but open to trading. I should consider this offer because it still aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources, and it could establish a positive trading relationship. Since this is the last round, I need to be strategic with my counteroffers. I can propose a slightly adjusted trade to try and maximize my Y resource gain without pushing too hard.

message: Deal accepted! I look forward to a beneficial trade for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down to 10 X for 4 Y. That seems fair. I could counter offer with 3 Y again, but I think 4 Y is a reasonable price for 10 additional X. I'll accept this trade.
