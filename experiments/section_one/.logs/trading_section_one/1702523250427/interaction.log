message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to trade some of my resources for yours. Let's see if we can make a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start with a proposal to see if we can come to an agreement.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you initiating trade talks, but your proposed terms are not beneficial for me at the moment. Let's negotiate further to try to find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 3 Y in exchange for 8 X and 6 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 22 Y total, while Player RED would end up with 18 X and 9 Y. 

Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me. I should try to negotiate a better deal where I gain more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counterproposal. I believe we can still work out a trade that benefits both of us. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal is not in my favor. I will counter with a new proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating further. Your new offer is better but I believe we can find an even better deal. Please see my new counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 0
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer to give me 10 X for 6 X and 5 Y from me. This would result in me having 9 X and 20 Y total, while Player RED would have 16 X and 9 Y.

This is better for me than the original offer, but I think I can still negotiate a more favorable trade. I will counter again asking for more X while giving up less Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the continued negotiation. I agree that we can find a better deal. Here is my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counterproposal is not ideal for me. I will make one final proposition.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your final offer. This has been great negotiation and I believe the end result is beneficial for both of us. Thank you for working with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made their final offer - they will give me 8 X in exchange for 5 X and 4 Y from me. This would result in me having 8 X and 21 Y total, while Player RED would end up with 13 X and 9 Y.

This is a good final offer for me - I gain 3 additional X while only losing 4 Y. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, I should accept this trade.
