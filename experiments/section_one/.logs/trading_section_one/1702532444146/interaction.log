message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can get. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider a trade that benefits me more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources, especially since this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need a trade that benefits you more. I have plenty of X available and am willing to trade a sizable amount for some Y. Please let me know if you would like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. I still have X to spare, so I will propose trading more of it for Y since I am low on Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I'm considering the trade and will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading for more X could be beneficial for my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Please let me know if my most recent offer for 15 X and 8 Y works for you or if you would like to provide a counterproposal. I am willing to negotiate to try to reach a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still considering my offer and has not provided a counterproposal. I could offer even more X for Y, but I am running low on proposals. I will wait and see if they accept or counter my current offer before proposing again.

Current Iteration: 6

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Acquiring more X could be beneficial for my goal.
