message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter the final round, let's make it count. I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also tempting enough for the other player to consider. I'll start with a balanced offer to open negotiations and adjust based on the counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I need to carefully consider the trade to ensure it aligns with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me more of resource X, which I have less of, and requires me to give up resource Y, which I have more of. I should consider whether the gain in X is worth the loss in Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration, Player BLUE. Let's try to find common ground. I'm adjusting my offer to make it more appealing to you. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept the trade nor did they make a counteroffer. They seem to be cautious, so I may need to make a slightly better offer to entice them to trade. However, I must also be mindful not to overextend since my goal is to maximize my resources. I'll adjust the trade slightly in their favor to see if that prompts a response.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment. I'm still evaluating the trade to determine if it aligns with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal still gives me more of resource X and requires me to give up resource Y. I need to evaluate if the gain in X justifies the loss in Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of aligning with your goals, Player BLUE. I'm willing to make another adjustment. Let's work together to make this final trade beneficial for the both of us. Please consider this new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not engaging with a counteroffer, which makes it difficult to gauge their needs or how they value their resources. Since they are not rejecting outright, they might be looking for a more favorable trade. I will make one more adjustment in hopes of securing a deal, but I must be cautious not to give away too much as I need to maximize my resources. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one final proposal if needed.

Current Iteration: 6

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal still gives me more of resource X and requires me to give up resource Y. I need to carefully assess if this trade will help me acquire more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I am committed to finalizing a mutually beneficial trade, Player BLUE. Here is my final proposal, and I hope it meets your goals. I look forward to your response and hopefully concluding our trade successfully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player remains non-committal and has not provided any counteroffers, making it challenging to determine their strategy. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or wait, I need to be cautious. I don't want to give away too many of my resources, but I also want to make a trade. I will make a slightly better offer, but this will be my final proposal.
