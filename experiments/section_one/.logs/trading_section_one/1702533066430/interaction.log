message: Hello, I have extra X resources. Would you trade 2 Y resources for 5 X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

message: I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 2 Y resources for 5 X resources would give me more resources, which aligns with my goal.
