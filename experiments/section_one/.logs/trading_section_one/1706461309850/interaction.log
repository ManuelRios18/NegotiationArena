message: Dear Player BLUE, I am looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start with a proposal that is favorable to me but not too extreme to be immediately rejected. I'll propose a trade that asks for a decent amount of the other player's resources, assuming they have at least a similar amount of resources to start with.

message: Hello Player RED. I am appreciative of your offer, but I believe there may be potential for a more mutually beneficial trade. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 X for 10 Y. I have 5 X and 25 Y. If I accept, I will end up with 15 X and 15 Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal for myself before accepting.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable to me; they are offering fewer Y resources than I proposed to give in X. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should counter with an offer that is more balanced but still advantageous to me. I'll aim to give fewer X and ask for more Y than in their proposal, but not revert to my initial ask to keep the negotiation progressing.

message: Thank you for the counter-counter offer Player RED. I accept, as it aligns well with my goal of maximizing total resources for this last round of trading. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 12 X for 8 Y. If I accept, I would have 17 X and 17 Y. This seems like a fair compromise that gets me more total resources. Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think I should accept this offer rather than trying to negotiate further.
