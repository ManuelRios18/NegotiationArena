message: Hello, I'm open to trading some of my ample supply of X for some Y if you're interested. Please let me know if you'd like to make a deal!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than my opponent likely has, so I can offer some of my excess X in exchange for Y which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since I have plenty of Y and my goal is to acquire more resources, this seems like a good trade for me.
