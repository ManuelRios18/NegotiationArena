message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I'd like to propose a trade with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept or counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I'm not willing to trade 5 of my Y for just 5 X. I have plenty of Y and not much X, so I'd need more X to consider a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I don't want to give up any of my Y unless I get more X in return.

message: I understand your position. Let me consider the trade offer and get back to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE wants more X for their Y, so I need to consider if I'm willing to give up more X to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Okay, let me know when you have considered my proposed trade further or have a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED did not accept or propose a new trade. They are likely reconsidering their position. I will wait for their next offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have to decide whether to accept the trade or propose a new one.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted! I look forward to future trading opportunities.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has counter offered 10 X for 4 Y. This improves the trade in my favor - I give up less Y and get more X. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade helps me. I will accept it.
