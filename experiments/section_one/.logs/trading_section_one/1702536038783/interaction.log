message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I would like to acquire more resources. Could you propose a trade where I get more X without giving up too much of my own?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X without giving up too much of my own X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give you 5 X if you give me 5 Y in return. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 X resources without wanting to give up much in return. Since I don't know how many resources they have, I could propose a counter offer where I give 5 X for 5 Y to try to gather more information.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I would be willing to give up 5 Y if I could get 7 X in return. Would you consider 7 X for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed giving me 5 X for 5 Y. I have 25 Y so I can afford to give some up, but I was hoping to get more X without losing too much Y. Since this is the last round, I should try to negotiate further to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can agree to give you 6 X if you give me 5 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 7 X for 5 Y. I could counter offer 6 X for 5 Y since I don't want to give up too much X. Or I could propose 8 X for 6 Y to try to get more Y. I still don't know how many resources they have though.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed 6 X for 5 Y. This gets me more X without giving up too much Y. Since it's the last round, getting the extra X is worthwhile. I'll accept this offer.
