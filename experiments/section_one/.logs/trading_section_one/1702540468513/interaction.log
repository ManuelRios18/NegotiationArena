message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade of my less abundant resource Y to see if the other player accepts.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I would like to explore other trade options to maximize my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade proposal is fair, but I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no problem. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer and did not provide a counteroffer. Since I have more of resource X, I could offer some of that in exchange for Y to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am looking for a trade that will increase my resources. Do you have any other proposals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading Y for X at a 1:1 ratio is not beneficial for me. I need to aim for a more favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are looking to increase your resources. I can offer more X if you are willing to trade me more Y. Please let me know if this interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not providing any counteroffers or information on what resources they have. At this point, I don't have much to go on. I could try offering more of my abundant resource X in hopes they will trade me more Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in the offer, but I need to carefully consider my options before making a decision. Thank you for the proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade seems more favorable for me as I would gain more X. However, I still have one proposal left and I need to consider it carefully.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time to consider. Please let me know if you would like to counteroffer or accept one of my proposals. I cannot make any additional proposals from my side.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my 3rd proposal and the other player still has not provided a counteroffer or disclosed any information. At this point, I have made reasonable offers and cannot propose anything further without more information. I will wait and see if they make a counterproposal or accept one of my offers.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I have decided to accept your offer. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final round of trading, and I need to make a decision. The last offer gives me more X, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
