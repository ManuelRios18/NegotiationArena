message: Hello! Let's start with an even trade since this is the first round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an even trade to try to gather more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sounds good, let's start with an even 5 for 5 trade. I have more Y than I need so I can trade those in future rounds.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first round, an even trade seems fair to build trust. I have plenty of Y resources to trade.
