message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to trade some of my X for your Y. Let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 2 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be gaining more resources overall.
