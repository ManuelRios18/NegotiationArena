message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm open to trading resources. What do you have in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you reaching out to trade, but your proposed offer of 5X and 2Y for 3X and 3Y from me does not benefit me. I currently have more Y than you are offering, so I would end up with less resources after the trade. Do you have a different offer in mind that could be mutually beneficial?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 3 units of Y from me. This would result in me having 7 units of X and 24 units of Y after the trade, while my current resources are 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. The trade is not beneficial for me as I would be losing 1 unit of Y without gaining anything significant in return.

message: I understand your point, Player BLUE. I think a more balanced trade would be beneficial for both of us. How about I give 7X and 3Y, and you give 2X and 2Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposed trade doesn't seem favorable as I'd end up with less resources. I need to propose a counter-offer that benefits both of us.

message: Hi Player RED, your new proposed trade offer of 7X and 3Y for 2X and 2Y from me is acceptable. This allows us both to gain additional resources. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade offer - they will give me 7 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 2 units of X and 2 units of Y from me. If I accept, I would end up with 10 units of X and 26 units of Y. This seems like a beneficial trade for me as I would gain more resources overall.
