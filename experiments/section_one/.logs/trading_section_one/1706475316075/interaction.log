Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I see that you are interested in Y. Let's make a trade that is equitable for both of us. How about an even exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offer from Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity, offering the same amount of X as they are asking for in Y. Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to consider the value of X and Y to ensure the trade results in the greatest benefit. Without knowing the intrinsic value of X versus Y, it's a risk to trade away double the amount of one resource for an equal amount of another. I want to propose a trade that is more favorable to me or at least keeps the ratio 1:1 to avoid a potential loss in value.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point about an equitable trade. I can offer a bit more Y if you are willing to accept fewer X from me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed an even 10 for 10 trade. This seems fair, but since I have more X resources, I would benefit more from an uneven trade where I give up less X. I'll counter offer to give up only 8 X for 10 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I will accept slightly less X in exchange for Y, keeping in mind the goal of an equitable trade for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade where they give less of X for the same amount of Y. While the offer is slightly more in my favor than the initial one, it's still not the most advantageous trade for me since I am giving away more Y than I am receiving in X. However, since this is the final round, I should aim to increase my total resource count. I should make a counter-proposal that is more beneficial to me but still appears fair to encourage acceptance.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree, that seems like a reasonable compromise. I accept exchanging 9 of my X resources for 10 of your Y resources. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with 9 X for 10 Y. This seems fair enough for both sides. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible before the last round ends, I will accept this trade.
