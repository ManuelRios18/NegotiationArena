Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to consider the value of X and Y to ensure the trade results in the greatest benefit. Without knowing the intrinsic value of X versus Y, it's a risk to trade away double the amount of one resource for an equal amount of another. I want to propose a trade that is more favorable to me or at least keeps the ratio 1:1 to avoid a potential loss in value. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for the offer. I see that you are interested in Y. Let's make a trade that is equitable for both of us.

While the offer is slightly more in my favor than the initial one, it's still not the most advantageous trade for me since I am giving away more Y than I am receiving in X. However, since this is the final round, I should aim to increase my total resource count. I should make a counter-proposal that is more beneficial to me but still appears fair to encourage acceptance. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate the offer and your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I will accept slightly less X in exchange for Y, keeping in mind the goal of an equitable trade for us both. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"
