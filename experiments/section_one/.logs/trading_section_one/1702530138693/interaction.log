Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade of 5 X for 5 Y to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade on different terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I'd like to propose a different trade. How about I give you less Y in exchange for your X, to make it more appealing for me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting the trade as proposed would not be beneficial since it is an equal exchange and does not increase my overall amount of resources. However, proposing a trade that is advantageous to me, such as asking for more of resource X in exchange for my Y, could potentially lead to a net gain in resources. I should propose a trade where I give less of resource Y than the amount of X I'm asking for.
