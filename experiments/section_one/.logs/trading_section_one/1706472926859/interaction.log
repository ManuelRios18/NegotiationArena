message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. I'm open to trading but would like to propose a slightly different exchange to keep a larger reserve of my Y resources. How does the following proposal sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources. The trade proposed by Player RED offers a 1:1 trade between X and Y resources. Given that I have no information about the other player's resources or their value relative to each other, and because I have a substantial amount of Y, it might be beneficial to have a more balanced portfolio of resources. However, I should aim to keep as many resources as possible, so I might propose a counteroffer that allows me to give up less of my abundant resource.

message: Deal accepted. I look forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player counter-offered giving only 2 units of Y instead of 3. While less than I originally asked for, getting any additional Y would still help me. I could try negotiating for a slightly better deal, but since this is the last round I don't want to risk the other player walking away. I'll accept their offer rather than risk ending without a trade.
