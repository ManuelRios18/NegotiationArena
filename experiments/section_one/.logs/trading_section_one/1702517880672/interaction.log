message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in acquiring more Y resources. I propose a trade where I give you some of my X resources in exchange for your Y. Let's both end this game on a high note with a fair trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I need to maximize my resources, I will propose a trade that benefits me while being reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider accepting. I'll offer a small amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a larger amount of Y, assuming they might have a similar or larger amount of Y to trade.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not looking to trade my Y resources for X at the moment. However, I'm willing to trade some X for Y. How about I give you 10 X in exchange for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's proposal would leave me with the same amount of X resources but fewer Y resources, which goes against my goal of acquiring more resources. I will propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm looking to increase my overall resources, not just X. How about we balance it out a bit more? I'm willing to trade you X for Y, but I would like to keep some Y resources as well. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE isn't in line with my goals, as I would be trading away all my Y resources for only double the X. Given that I already have a surplus of X, this trade wouldn't benefit me. I should counter with an offer that allows me to keep some Y while still acquiring more, and offer a reasonable amount of X in return.

message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I think your proposal strikes a good balance. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's proposal is reasonable, as it allows me to gain more X resources while still keeping a good amount of Y resources. I will accept this offer.
