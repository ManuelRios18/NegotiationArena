message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing the following trade since this is the last round. Please let me know if you would accept or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your proposed exchange rate of 2 Y per 1 X seems unfavorable for me. Could you offer a better rate?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to increase my amount of X. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X may not be the best deal for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposed trade of 8 X for 10 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE countered my original offer asking for a better exchange rate. They proposed 8 X for 10 Y. Since I have a lot more X, I am willing to trade more X to get more Y.
