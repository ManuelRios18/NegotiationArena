message: Hello Blue, let's trade resources to mutually benefit. I propose an equal trade to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Blue's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Red, I appreciate your offer for an equal trade. Considering this is our last round, I'm looking for a trade that is slightly more beneficial for me. I hope you find my counter-offer fair and in the spirit of mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is equal and doesn't benefit me as I neither gain nor lose resources. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should either propose a trade that is favorable to me or wait to see if Player RED comes up with a better offer. However, since this is the last round of trading, waiting is not an option. Hence, I should counter-propose a trade that is advantageous for me, but still seems fair enough for the other player to consider.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-offer Blue. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Blue countered with an offer that benefits them more. I could reject and counter again to be more favorable to me, but since I don't know Blue's resources, I risk them walking away with no trade if I seem too greedy. I will accept their offer since it still increases my total resources.
