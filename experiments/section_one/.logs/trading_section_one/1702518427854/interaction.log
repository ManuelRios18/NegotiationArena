message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following exchange. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me. I will aim to get more of resource X which I have in abundance and try to trade away some of my Y. I don't know what the other player values, so I'll start with a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to balance the trade with more Y. How about we adjust the trade to benefit both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me more X, but I would prefer to get more Y as well.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for more of resource Y. Here's a revised offer that I believe could work for both of us. I'm open to further discussion if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 18, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems interested in resource Y. Since this is the last round and there wonâ€™t be another opportunity to trade, I should aim to maximize the resources I gain while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE. However, I must be cautious not to give away too much of Y, as it might be more valuable than I initially thought. I will propose a trade that offers more Y but also asks for more X in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to adjust the trade, but I'm still looking to acquire more resources in total. Can we work towards a trade that maximizes the overall gain?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer gives me more Y, which is beneficial, but I still want to aim for a higher total resource gain.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see that you're aiming for a trade that increases our overall resource pool. I am willing to offer a larger exchange to meet that goal. Here's a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 20, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not revealing their resource counts and is pushing for a trade that maximizes overall gain. This suggests they might value one of the resources more but are not disclosing which one. I have to be careful not to give away my leverage. I'll propose a trade that increases the total volume of resources being exchanged, which might be perceived as maximizing overall gain, but I'll still aim to keep the trade in my favor.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I believe this trade is beneficial for both of us. I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer provides a significant increase in total resources, which aligns with my goal.
