message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in trading resources to maximize my holdings. I would like to propose an initial trade and look forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that doesn't compromise my own supply too much but is still attractive enough to consider. The goal is to gather more resources, but without knowledge of what Player BLUE has or wants, I need to make an offer that is reasonable but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading 6 X and 2 Y for 5 X and 1 Y. However, I am open to trading some of my extra Y resources for more X. Please send an offer you think could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X and 1 Y in exchange for 6 X and 2 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could trade some of my excess Y for more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see you have an interest in X resources. I would like to propose a trade that gives you more X in exchange for Y, but the current ratio is not quite beneficial to me. Let's try this offer, which I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests they are interested in obtaining more of resource X in exchange for their surplus of Y. The 1:1.67 ratio they propose (3 X for 5 Y) is not in my best interest, as it would result in a net loss of resources when considering the total quantity. If I can negotiate a more favorable exchange rate for resource X, it would be beneficial. I need to make a counteroffer that leans more towards an equal exchange while still enticing Player BLUE to accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I accept your proposed trade of 4 X for 6 Y. I believe this allows us both to gain resources that are useful for our goals. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed giving me 4 X for 6 Y. I was hoping to get more X for my Y, but I could accept this trade since X is more valuable to me right now and this is the last round.
