message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Yes, I am interested in trading. Your offer of 5 X for 5 Y is agreeable to me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, so I can afford to give 5 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, getting 5 X resources in return is beneficial.
