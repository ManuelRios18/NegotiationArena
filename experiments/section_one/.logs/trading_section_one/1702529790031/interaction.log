message: Hello! I have more X than Y. Would you be interested in trading some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be acceptable to them. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

message: Thank you for your offer, I'm happy to accept the trade. It's a pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have a substantial amount of Y and the other player has more X than Y, it could be beneficial to accept a trade that increases my X resources while giving away some of my Y. The current offer is quite balanced, and I can afford to lose 3 Y in exchange for 5 X. This would give me a more balanced resource pool and potentially more overall resources if the other player has a lot of X. Accepting this trade seems like a good move.
