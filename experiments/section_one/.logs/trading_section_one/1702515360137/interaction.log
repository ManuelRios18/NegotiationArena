Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to see if we can benefit mutually from our resources. Looking forward to a fruitful negotiation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a modest proposal that would benefit me by increasing my Y resources while keeping a healthy amount of X. This strategy is to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response, which will help me tailor future proposals if necessary.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am willing to trade but your proposed exchange rate of 2 Y per 1 X is too high for me. Let's try to find a fairer rate that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X may not be optimal for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your concern about the exchange rate. I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests an exchange rate of 1 Y for 1 X. Given my goal is to maximize resources, this trade is not beneficial as it does not increase my total amount of resources. I should counter with a proposal that provides me with a net gain of resources while also attempting to make the trade appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you Player RED, I accept your offer of 8 X for 12 Y. I believe this will benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a better exchange rate offer of 8 X for 12 Y. This values 1 X as equivalent to 1.5 Y. I'm still getting more X relative to my current resources, so this helps me. And giving up 12 Y is acceptable.
