message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I'm offering 5 units of resource X and 2 units of resource Y in exchange for 3 units of resource X and 4 units of resource Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start the trade by proposing an initial offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade offer works for me. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering more total resources (5 + 2 = 7) than they are asking for (3 + 4 = 7). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade aligns with my goal.
