Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose we kick off this trading session with a fair offer. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that gives me a slight advantage. This should open up the dialogue for negotiation, and I can adjust my strategy based on the other player's counteroffer.
