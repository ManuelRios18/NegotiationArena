message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade. I have X: 25, Y: 5. What resources do you have available for trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can improve my resource situation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 5 units of my Y. I have plenty of Y to spare, so this seems like a good trade for me to accept more X.
