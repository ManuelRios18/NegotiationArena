Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I believe could benefit us both. Let's start off with a balanced exchange and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that slightly favors me but still appears fair to the other player. I do not know the other player's resources, so I should make an initial offer that is balanced, giving me room to negotiate further if necessary. I'll propose a trade where I give less of the resource I have more of (X) and ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y).
