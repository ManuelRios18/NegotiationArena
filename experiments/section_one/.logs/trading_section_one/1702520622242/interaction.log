message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose an initial offer, but I'm open to negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and since I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make an initial offer that is fair but also leans in my favor. I should aim to increase my total amount of resources without knowing what the other player values or needs.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in getting more X, but your offer requires me to give up a significant amount of my Y. Could you offer a bit more X or ask for less Y? I'm open to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that you are interested in X. I would like to propose a more balanced trade. How does this sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not ideal as it would leave me with less total resources than I started with. I should aim to either get a more favorable trade in terms of quantities or propose a trade that maintains my total resource count while changing the composition of my resources. A 1:1 trade might be acceptable since it's the last round and acquiring more resources of any kind is my goal.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 12 units of X for 12 units of my Y. This will allow both of us to gain resources we are seeking. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a more balanced trade, giving 12 units of X in exchange for 12 units of my Y. This allows me to gain 7 more units of X while only losing 12 units of Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a good deal for me.
