Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. But I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to carefully consider the trade. I'll get back to you with a decision soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y. The trade proposed by the other player would reduce my Y by 3 but increase my X by 5. I need to consider if the increase in X is worth the decrease in Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have a large supply of X resources (25 units) but very little Y (5 units). My goal is to acquire more resources overall. If you are low on X but have some Y to spare, I think we could help each other out with a trade. Let me know if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. This likely means they need more information to make a decision. I could disclose I have a lot of X and need more Y in my message to see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point about acquiring more resources overall. I'm open to considering a trade that would benefit both of us. Let me think about a potential counter offer that aligns with our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has a large supply of X but very little Y, and their goal is to acquire more resources overall. I have 5 X and 25 Y, so I could potentially help them with their goal while also considering my own resource balance.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you seem open to trading, I can offer more X resources if needed. How about 10 X for 5 Y? Let me know if that interests you or what you would propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems open to trading but has not proposed anything yet. I could try a larger trade offer since I disclosed I have a lot of X resources. But I don't want to propose too much without knowing what they have. I still have 2 proposals left, so I can afford to make another offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer for more X resources. I'm still evaluating the best trade for both of us. Let me think about a potential counter offer that could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 X for 5 Y, which would greatly increase my X resources but reduce my Y resources. I need to carefully consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: As mentioned, my goal is to acquire more resources overall in this last round of trading. Specifically, I'm hoping to get at least 10-15 more Y resources if possible. I have lots of X to trade. Please let me know if you can propose an offer for 10-15 Y that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still considering and has not proposed a counter offer. I'm running out of proposals to make. I could disclose more information about my resource goals to see if we can align on a mutually beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand your goal of acquiring more Y resources, and I'm considering how we can both benefit from a trade. Let me evaluate my resources and come up with a proposal that aligns with both of our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to acquire at least 10-15 more Y resources and has lots of X to trade. This gives me an opportunity to potentially help them achieve their goal while also considering my own resource balance and goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
