message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade. I'm willing to trade some of my X for your Y. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the X!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 2 units of my Y. I have plenty of Y to spare, so this seems like a good trade for me to accept more X.
