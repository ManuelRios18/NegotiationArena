message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I would like to gain more resources in this trade. Could you propose something where I gain some Y resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire more resources, I should reject this trade and propose one where I gain more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have 5 Y resources available to trade. Could you offer me more X resources if I give you all 5 of my Y? This is the last chance to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 Y resources from me, but I only have 5 Y. I could offer them all my Y to get more X resources back. But since this is the last round, I don't necessarily need to trade away all my resources if the return is not good enough. I'll try negotiating for a better deal first before considering giving up all my Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can offer 7 X resources if you give me your 5 Y resources. This allows us both to gain resources. Please let me know if you would accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they only have 5 Y resources to trade. They are asking for 10 of my X resources in exchange. I still want to try to gain more resources overall. I could counter offer 7 X for their 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 5

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered 7 X resources for my 5 Y resources. This allows me to gain 2 more X overall, while giving up all my remaining Y. Since more resources are always better and this is the last round, I should accept this trade to end with more resources.
