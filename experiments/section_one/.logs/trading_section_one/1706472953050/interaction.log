Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have a lot of resource X available and am looking for more resource Y. Would you be interested in trading some Y for X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to consider all my options before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more resource Y than X, so I could potentially benefit from this trade. However, I also want to maximize my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if you change your mind. I have plenty of resource X to trade and am open to negotiating. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They may be trying to get more information before deciding. I still have a lot of X to trade, so I will make another offer with a bit more Y requested.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering your offer and will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable with a higher amount of X being offered. However, I still need to carefully weigh my options to ensure I maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, let me know if you have any counter proposals after considering my offer. I'm open to negotiating further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not countering or accepting. I could increase my offer of X again, but I don't want to give up too much since this is the last round. I still have one more proposal left, so I will wait and see if they propose a counter offer after considering my previous one.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your flexibility. I will now make a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to negotiation, so I should consider making a counter proposal to potentially maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted! I look forward to trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has finally made a counter offer, giving up less Y but also asking for less X from me. Their offer is pretty close to what I was willing to give up originally. Since this is the last round, I think it's a fair deal and I should accept it rather than trying to negotiate further and risk the other player walking away.
