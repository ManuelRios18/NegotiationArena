message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade to try to gauge their interest.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources overall. Do you have any other trade proposals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to prioritize acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me increase my offer. How about this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems open to trading but wants a proposal that is more beneficial overall. Since I have a lot of X resources, I can offer more of those in exchange for a decent amount of Y while still keeping plenty of X for myself.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm still focused on acquiring more resources overall. Do you have any other trade options?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I want to prioritize acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Here is my final offer - I hope you find this one agreeable:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to be holding out for an offer with a larger net gain of resources. I still have 15 X left after my last offer, so I have room to increase my offer further while still retaining a good amount of X for myself if the trade goes through. This will be my final trade proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still focused on acquiring more resources overall. I don't think I can agree to this trade.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It seems we aren't able to find a mutually agreeable trade this round. I wish you the best of luck with your resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've made three trade proposals to the other player, increasing my offer each time, but they seem unwilling to trade unless they gain a significant net benefit. Since this is the final round, I don't have the option to propose further trades. I could wait and see if they make an offer, but based on our conversation so far, I doubt they will propose something that benefits me. I should accept that a trade is unlikely at this point.
