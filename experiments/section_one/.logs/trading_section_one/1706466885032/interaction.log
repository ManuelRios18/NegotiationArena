message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose a fair exchange to benefit us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I will start by proposing a balanced trade where I offer a reasonable amount of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the less abundant resource (Y), trying to make the trade attractive to the other player while also increasing my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The proposed trade doesn't meet my goal of acquiring more resources. I'm looking for a more balanced exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable for me as it involves giving away more resources than I receive.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for balance. Let's adjust the terms to better meet our goals. I am willing to offer more of my resource X for your resource Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is seeking a more balanced exchange but did not provide a counter-proposal. Since this is the last round, I need to make a trade that increases my overall resource count while also being appealing to the other player. I will adjust my offer slightly, giving up more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their resource (Y), but still retain a net gain in total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I'm still looking for a more beneficial trade for my resources. Let's continue to work towards a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more favorable, but I still feel I could get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I respect your need for a beneficial trade. Let's find our common ground. Here's an improved offer, hoping it aligns with your goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not satisfied with the trade offer and is looking for more benefit. Without knowing their resources, it's challenging to propose a perfect trade. However, I'll make one final proposal that's more generous to entice acceptance, ensuring I still end up with a net gain in resources. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more if necessary.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I believe the improved offer aligns better with my goals. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable for me, as I would be getting more X in exchange for Y.
