message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading? I propose an offer which I believe could be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to hearing your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an offer that benefits me but is also reasonable enough that the other player might consider it. I will offer a balanced amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, assuming the other player might want to balance their resources as well.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading to diversify my resources, but your proposed exchange rate is heavily skewed in your favor. I counteroffer the following more fair trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help diversify my resources. However, I think the proposed exchange rate is unfairly in Player RED's favor since Y is more scarce. I will counteroffer with a more balanced rate.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Your terms are acceptable to me. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE gives a ratio of 2.5 X for 1 Y, which is better for me than the initial 3.33 X for 1 Y I proposed. Accepting this offer would still increase my total resource count and get me closer to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, it's beneficial to make a deal.
