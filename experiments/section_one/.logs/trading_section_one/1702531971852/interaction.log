message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to maximize my resources in this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, since this is the last round it makes sense to try to maximize resources. I have more Y resources available, would you be willing to trade some of your X resources for them?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in an equal trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round, I will propose trading most of my less valuable Y resources for hopefully more of the more valuable X resource.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think I'll hold onto my X resources for now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final round.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if you reconsider or would like to propose an alternative trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not interested in trading their X resources. I have already made 2 trade proposals and have 1 remaining. I could propose trading all my remaining Y for X as a final attempt. Or I could wait and see if they propose a trade instead since I don't know what resources they have. I'll wait and see if they make an offer first before using my last proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No problem, please let me know if you have a proposal to trade some of your resources for some of my X resources. Otherwise I am also happy to wait and see.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not made any trade proposals and I am out of trade proposals to make. I could accept a trade for a portion of my X resources if offered since this is the last round, otherwise I will wait and see if they propose something.
