message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair trade since this is the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Since this is the last round, let's trade in a way that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an equal trade of 5 X and 5 Y each. Since I have more Y than them, I could propose trading more Y to get more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have more X resources than Y. Let's trade in a way that balances our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE proposed trading 10 of my X resources for 10 of their Y resources. This trade benefits them more than me since I have more X resources. I will counter offer with a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You make a fair point. I have a lot more Y than you. Let's trade equal amounts of X and Y to balance things.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED rejected my previous offer and proposed trading 5 X and 5 Y for 10 Y from me. This would give me more X which is good, but I would lose more Y than them. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I could try countering to trade less Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Getting only Y doesn't help me much. Let's exchange equal X and Y so we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE proposed trading 5 of my Y resources for 0 of their X resources. This helps balance our resources, but I would benefit more by getting some X resources from them rather than just losing Y. I will counter offer to get some of their X.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed trading equal amounts of 3 X and 3 Y. This seems fair for both sides. Since my goal is to maximize resources, accepting this trade will increase my resources.
