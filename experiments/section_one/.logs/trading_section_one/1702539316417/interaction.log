message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's make a fair trade to end the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being enticing enough for the other player to accept. I have a lot of resource X and only a little of resource Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an even fairer agreement. How about an even swap to simplify our last trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not advantageous enough for me. They are offering to trade their X for my Y at a 1:2 ratio. I have more Y than X, so I could consider a trade, but I would want to get a better ratio to maximize my resources. Since this is the last round, I should attempt to negotiate a more favorable deal. I will reject the offer and counter with a trade that still gives me a net gain in resources while being more balanced. I'll propose a 1:1 ratio, which is fairer given the information at hand.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed an even 10 for 10 trade. This would double my amount of resource Y which is valuable since I currently have very little of it. I should accept this offer since it helps me meet my goal of acquiring more resources overall.
