message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources available and am interested in trading for some Y. Please let me know if you would be interested in a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a conservative offer.

message: I accept the trade, let's proceed with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X resources and 25 Y resources. The other player has proposed to trade 5 X for 5 Y. This seems like a fair trade to balance our resources.
