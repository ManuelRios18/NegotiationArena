message: Hello! Let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think the trade is not balanced. Let's try to find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is giving 10 X for 5 Y, which seems unbalanced in their favor. I need to propose a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a lower amount of X and Y in the trade. This is still beneficial for me since I have a lot more X than Y. I should accept this trade.
