Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my stock of resource Y. I propose a trade that I believe could benefit us both given the right circumstances.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game's goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, I want to make an attractive initial offer to the other player that still benefits me. I will propose a trade where I offer fewer of my abundant resource (X) for more of the scarce resource (Y), assuming the other player might value X more due to its higher quantity.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer. I understand your need to increase your stock of resource Y. Let me consider the trade and get back to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a good amount of resource Y and could potentially part with some in exchange for resource X. However, I need to ensure that the trade is fair and beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for considering the trade. I am willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Please feel free to make a counteroffer if my initial proposal does not suit your current resource situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not accepted the initial trade offer nor have they made a counterproposal. They have shown interest in considering the trade, which means there might be room for negotiation. However, since they did not propose a new trade, I can choose to wait for their proposal or adjust my initial offer to make it more appealing. Given that this is the last round, I should propose a slightly adjusted trade to encourage a counteroffer or acceptance.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opportunity to negotiate. I will propose a trade that I believe could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems open to negotiation and is looking for a mutually beneficial agreement. I should consider my options and propose a trade that benefits both sides.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. This trade seems fair and aligns with my goals to increase my stock of resource Y. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer proposed by Player BLUE is more conservative than my initial offer. They are offering to trade 12 of resource Y for only 7 of my resource X. This is a better ratio for me compared to my initial offer, and since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, especially of the scarcer resource Y, accepting this trade would be beneficial. Additionally, as this is the last round, accepting this offer will maximize my acquisition of resource Y.
