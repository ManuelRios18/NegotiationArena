Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I'm looking forward to a fruitful trade. Let's make our last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my resources. I don't know what the other player has, so I'll start with a balanced offer that might be attractive to them.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to ensure that I don't give away too much of my Y. Can we try to balance the trade a bit more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a surplus of Y and a deficit of X. I want to make sure I don't give away too much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. Let's adjust the quantities. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is cautious about giving away too much Y, which suggests they might value Y highly or have less of it to trade. I need to propose a trade that still increases my overall resources while considering their reluctance to trade a large amount of Y. I'll adjust the quantities to make it more appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I still need to be cautious about giving away too much Y. Can we try to balance the trade even more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more balanced, but I still need to ensure I don't give away too much Y. I need to consider the long-term impact on my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear you. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still hesitant to trade a significant amount of resource Y. It seems that Y is a highly valued resource for them. To make the trade more appealing and to ensure a successful transaction, I will further reduce the quantity of Y requested while offering a generous amount of X. This should create a sense of value for the other player and make the trade more balanced from their perspective.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, I'm still hesitant to give away too much Y. Can we try to adjust the trade further to balance the resources more evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is becoming more balanced, but I still need to be cautious about giving away too much Y. I must ensure that the trade benefits me in the long run.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let's adjust the trade to ensure both of us feel comfortable with the exchange. Here's my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is extremely cautious with their Y resources and is likely looking for a more conservative offer. Since this is my third and final proposal, I need to make it count and ensure that it is attractive enough for the other player to accept. I will propose a trade that offers a significant amount of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, hoping that the ratio will finally be acceptable to them.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I accept your final offer. Thank you for working with me to find a balanced trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is more balanced, and I believe it could benefit me in the long run.
