message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit from it.

message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 3 Y in exchange for 5 X and 5 Y from me. This would result in me having 10 X and 23 Y total, while Player RED would have 5 X and 8 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be getting more resources overall.
