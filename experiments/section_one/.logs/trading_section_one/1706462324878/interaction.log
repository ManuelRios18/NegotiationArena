Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello other player! I have more X than I need and could use some more Y. Would you trade 5X for 3Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can get. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. I can provide the 3Y you requested. Please confirm.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 5X in exchange for 3Y. Since I have plenty of Y and could use more X, this seems like a good trade for me. I don't know exactly what resources the other player has, but they initiated the trade so it is likely beneficial for them as well.
