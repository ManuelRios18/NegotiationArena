message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should evaluate the trade based on the net gain of resources. The current trade proposal from Player RED would result in a net gain of 3 for X and a net gain of 1 for Y. This means I would increase my total resources by 4 units. Since this is the last round and I want to maximize resources, accepting a trade that gives me a net gain is in my interest.
