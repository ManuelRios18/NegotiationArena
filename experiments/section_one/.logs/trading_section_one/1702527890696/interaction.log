message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to trade 10 units of resource X for 4 units of resource Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X for 4 units of Y. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a good trade for me to gain more overall resources. I should accept it while ensuring I have enough Y remaining to make future trades if needed.
