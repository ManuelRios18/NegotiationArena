Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources to help both of us achieve our goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if I can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I think we can come up with a trade that benefits us more. I'd like to propose an alternative to increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I would be trading 5 units of Y for 5 units of X, which does not increase my overall resource count. I want to propose a trade that increases my total resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources with this proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can come up with a trade that benefits both of us more. How about this alternative?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE doesn't increase my total resources, so I will counter with a different offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I’m looking for a trade that increases or at least maintains my total number of resources. Let's find a balanced trade that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal would give me an additional 5 units of X at the expense of 8 units of Y. This trade does not improve my overall resource count, since I would lose 3 resources overall. I should counter-propose with a trade that either increases my total resource count or maintains it while balancing my portfolio of resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. Let's work towards finding a balanced trade that benefits both of us. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal maintains their total resources but doesn't increase mine. I need to come up with a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: This trade looks good to me. It increases my total resources, which meets my goal. Let’s finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting the new proposal would increase my total resources by 2, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. This would give me a net gain of resources, so it would be beneficial to accept this trade.
