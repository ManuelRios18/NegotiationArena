message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make the most of this last opportunity to trade. I propose a fair exchange to benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will make an initial trade proposal that seems fair and beneficial to me, without knowing the other player's resources. I'll try to propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to start the negotiation process.
