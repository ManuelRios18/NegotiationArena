message: Hello! I have more X resources available than Y. Let's trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your proposed offer requires me to give up too much Y. Let's try to find a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with giving only 5 Y resources instead of 10. While less than I originally asked for, 5 extra Y resources would still benefit me. And I don't lose very much by giving away 5 X resources since I have so many more of those. I should accept this trade since it moves me closer to my goal.
