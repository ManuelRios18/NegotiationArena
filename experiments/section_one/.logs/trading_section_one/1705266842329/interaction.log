Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I have more Y than X at the moment, so I cannot accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is proposing to trade 5 X for 5 Y. I have more Y than X, so this trade would not benefit me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Could you please let me know approximately how much X and Y you have? That would help me make a fair trade offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player said they have more Y than X, so they are not interested in trading Y for X. I still don't know exactly how many resources they have. I could try offering more X for less Y to sweeten the deal. But I only have 3 chances to propose a trade myself, so I should be careful. I'll try asking for more information first before making another proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I prefer not to disclose my exact resources at this time. Let's focus on finding a fair trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I don't want to disclose my exact resources, as it may affect the trade offers.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Let me know if you change your mind. In the meantime, here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player does not want to disclose their resources. I still have 2 chances left to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject. I should make another offer, perhaps proposing to trade more X for less Y since they said they have more Y. But I don't want to propose too much X without knowing what they have.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I still have more Y than X, so this trade does not work for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering to trade 10 X for 3 Y. I have more Y than X, so this trade would not benefit me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Since you have more Y, I will wait for you to propose a trade that works for you. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: My previous two offers have been rejected because the other player has more Y than X. I have one more chance to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject. I could offer even more X for less Y, but without knowing their resources, I risk proposing too much. At this point, it may be better to wait for them to make an offer instead.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding. I will propose a trade that works for me shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X, so I need to propose a trade that benefits me.
