message: Hello, I am proposing we make a mutually beneficial trade this round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the trade offer, but I would like to propose a trade with a more balanced exchange of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of Y. I currently have more Y than X, so I would prefer to receive more X in the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let's try a more balanced trade. How about this offer instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial proposal and wants a more balanced trade. I still have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to trade some X for Y. I will propose a trade with a lower amount of X this time.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to make a more balanced trade. However, I still need more X in exchange for my Y. Can we adjust the trade to have a higher amount of X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED offers 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y, which is more balanced. However, I still have more Y than X, so I would prefer to receive more X in the trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Sure, let's increase the X. How about this offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants even more X for their Y. I have enough X to trade more, and I still need more Y, so I will increase the amount of X I offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I really need more X to balance out my resources. Can we make the trade with a higher amount of X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED offers 8 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y, which is more balanced than the previous offer. However, I would still prefer to receive more X in the trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Ok, this is close to the most X I can trade. How about:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for even more X. I'm running low on proposals, so I need to make sure I get a decent trade here. I have enough X to trade 10. I will propose that to try to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I think this trade is acceptable. I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of Y. This would help balance my resources, and I would still have some Y left.
