message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I would be interested in trading, but I would like to propose a different exchange. How about I give you a bit more of resource Y in exchange for your resource X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is even, but I need to consider if I want to balance my resources or if I want to keep a larger quantity of a single resource. Trading evenly doesn't necessarily meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, but it does diversify my holdings, which could be beneficial if I don't know the other player's resources and goals. Given that this is the last round, I want to make a counteroffer to try and gain an advantage. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for more of my abundant resource, Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would like to balance the trade a bit more in my favor. How about I give you X: 6 in exchange for Y: 12?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable for me as I want to acquire more resources. I'll make a counter offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counter-proposal sounds fair. Let's go ahead with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from the other player isn't as advantageous for me as my original proposal. However, considering that this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would still increase my total number of resources by one, and it would further balance my holdings of both resources. While I'm giving up a larger quantity of Y, the trade still leaves me with a substantial amount of it and increases my X by more than I currently hold. Therefore, accepting this trade is in line with my goal of maximizing my resources.
