Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Let's start off with a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and I do not know what resources the other player has or needs, my initial proposal will aim to offer a balanced trade that might be appealing to them. I'll propose giving up some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their resource (Y), assuming they might also have an abundant resource they're willing to trade. This is my first proposal out of three allowed.

message: This seems like a fair trade to me. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing a trade of 10 X for 10 Y. I have 5 X and 25 Y. This trade would benefit me since I would gain more X without losing too much Y. Since more resources are always better and this is the last round, I should accept this trade.
