Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm open to trading some of my ample X resources for some Y resources if you're interested. Please let me know if you'd like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I have to carefully consider my resources and goals before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and Y, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I need to consider whether trading Y for X will help me achieve that goal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no pressure. Let me know if trading X: 8 for Y: 8 might work for you instead. I'm open to negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They seem to be carefully considering their position. I will try to entice them with a slightly more generous offer of X resources, hoping they can part with more Y resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering the trade, but I need to ensure it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering a trade of X: 8 for Y: 8. I currently have more Y resources than X, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I need to carefully consider whether this trade will help me achieve that.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I have the same goal to maximize resources. As my final offer, how about Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10? Please let me know if you can accept, otherwise I cannot propose anything further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to have the same goal as me - acquire the most resources possible. They did not reject my offer outright, but are still considering it. I could increase my offer again, but I'm running out of reasonable proposals. I'll try one more generous offer using up my last allowed proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the final offer. I need to evaluate if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering a final trade of X: 10 for Y: 10. I currently have more Y resources than X, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I need to carefully consider whether this trade will help me achieve that.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have reached my proposal limit. Please let me know if you can accept the last proposed trade, otherwise we will end with no exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have used up my 3 allowed trade proposals. The other player seems unwilling to counter propose and is still evaluating my last offer. At this point, I cannot make any more proposals and can only accept if they propose a trade, or end the game with no trade if neither of us proposes anything further.  

I believe my final proposed trade of X: 10 for Y: 10 was reasonable for both sides to increase our resources. Unless the other player is very low on Y, they should accept. I will wait and see if they accept the trade or let the game end with no exchange.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: After careful consideration, I have decided to ACCEPT the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have to carefully consider whether the final trade proposed aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
