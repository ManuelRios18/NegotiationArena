message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources. Would you like to trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot of X and only a little Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer, I'm happy to accept it. This will be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED seems fair, and accepting it would increase my total resource count without depleting any one resource too much. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, it would be beneficial to accept a trade that increases my overall resources.
