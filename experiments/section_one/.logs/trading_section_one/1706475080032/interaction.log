message: Hello, since this is the last round, let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade. I have a lot of X resources available.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Any: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I can afford to offer some of those. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade some of my excess X for whatever they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm glad we're looking to trade. I can use more X resources. How about we adjust the trade slightly to reflect the abundance of Y resources I have?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to maximize the trade. I have an abundance of Y and a deficit of X, so it makes sense to trade some of my Y for X. However, I need to be cautious with the amount I propose to ensure that I end up with a greater total number of resources. Additionally, I need to consider that I shouldn't propose too many Y resources for X, as the other player might be trying to offload excess X. Assuming the value of X and Y is equal, a 1:1 trade would be fair, but since it's the last round, I want to negotiate a slightly better trade for myself if possible.

message: Trade accepted. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to have a lot of Y resources and wants more X. I'm still getting a decent amount of resources in this trade. Since this is the last round, it's best for me to accept a mutually beneficial trade rather than trying to negotiate further.
