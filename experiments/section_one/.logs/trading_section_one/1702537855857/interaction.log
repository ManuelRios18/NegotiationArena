message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. But I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade seems fair and aligns with my goals to increase my overall resources. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize the number of resources I end up with. The other player wants to trade their 5 X for my 3 Y. I currently have 5 X and 25 Y. If I accept this trade, I will have 10 X and 22 Y, which is a total of 32 resources. Rejecting the trade keeps me at 30 resources total. Accepting the trade gives me more resources overall, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Therefore, I should accept the trade.
