message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in making a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make the most of this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that is fair but also slightly in my favor, considering I do not know the other player's resources or goals. I want to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but that won't leave me at a disadvantage if they counter-propose.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your offer at this time, as I wish to retain as much of my Y resource as possible. However, I am open to a fair counteroffer if you wish to propose one. Let's work together here - there may still be room for mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y from me. I have 5 X and 25 Y. This trade would give me a net gain of 10 X, which helps me acquire more resources, but I would lose 15 Y. Since more resources are always better, I should try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to retain resource Y. Let's find a middle ground. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a desire to keep their Y resource, which suggests that resource might be more valuable or scarce for them. The counteroffer is not in my favor, as it is a one-to-one trade but I am giving away twice as much of resource X. I should counter with a proposal that balances the trade a bit more in my favor while still being appealing to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate you coming back with another offer. However, giving up 10 Y is still more than I would like. Could we find a middle ground between 5 Y and 10 Y that we both feel good about? Getting more X would benefit me, so I'm motivated to make this work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a counteroffer, proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 10 Y from me. This would result in me gaining 10 X while losing 10 Y. I originally offered to give up 5 Y for 10 X, but Player RED wants me to give up 10 Y instead. However, gaining 10 additional X would still help me acquire more overall resources, so this trade could be beneficial if I don't have to give up too much more Y. I still have 15 proposals remaining, so I can try to negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 7 Y for 10 X. Looking forward to concluding our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is closer to a fair trade, offering 7 Y for 10 X. This is a better ratio than the previous offers, and it is important to remember the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would increase my Y resources significantly, which seems to be a scarce resource for Player BLUE, indicating it might be valuable. Given this is the last round, it may be wise to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk ending with no trade at all.
