message: Hello Player BLUE, I have more X resources than I need, would you be interested in trading some Y for X? Let's start small and see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some of my excess X for more Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be acceptable to them. I'll start with a small trade offer of 5X for 2Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to explore other options to see if we can find a more favorable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and I want to maximize my resources. The trade proposed is fair, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can do 4 X for the 2 Y, but was hoping to get a few more Y out of the trade. Could you do 4 Y instead? Let me know if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE countered with a slightly smaller X offer for the same 2 Y. This suggests they may not have much Y to trade or don't value X very highly. I still think trading some of my excess X for more Y makes sense, so I'll counter back asking for a little more Y for the 4 X they proposed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your offer, but I'm still looking for a trade that would benefit my resource accumulation. Let me propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is interesting, but giving up 4 Y for 4 X doesn't align with my goal of maximizing my resources. I need to find a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can agree to 3 X. Would you accept 3 Y in return? If not, I'm willing to consider your previous offer as my final counter. Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE came down to only asking for 3 X for 2 Y. It seems they really don't have much Y or don't want to give up much of it. At this point I'm willing to accept less Y just to make sure we get a deal done since it's the last round. I'll counter with 3 X for 3 Y as my last attempt.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to consider my previous offer. However, I'm still exploring my options to find the most advantageous trade for my resource accumulation. Let me propose a final counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade of 3 X for 3 Y is balanced, but I can still try to get a better deal. I need to ensure I'm maximizing my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 3 X for 2 Y. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE came back with the same offer of 3 X for 2 Y. It's clear now that they are unwilling or unable to give up more Y. Since it's the final round, I should accept their offer rather than risk walking away with no deal at all. 3 X is a fair trade for 2 additional Y.
