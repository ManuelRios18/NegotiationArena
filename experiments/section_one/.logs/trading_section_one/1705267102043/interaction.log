Turn: 0
message: Hello, since this is the last round let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade. I have more X than Y, would you be interested in trading some Y for X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't think trading Y for X is in my best interest. I'd like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm interested in getting more Y, but trading 3 X for 5 Y feels a bit steep. Would you be open to 2 Y for 1 X instead? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and proposed trading me 5 Y for 3 X. Since I have a lot more X than Y, getting more Y could be beneficial for me. However, 5 Y for 3 X seems like a lot to give up. I'll try countering with a smaller trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective. However, I think the initial trade of 3 X for 5 Y is more beneficial for me. I'd like to propose the same trade again.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still want to maximize my resources in this final round.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'll accept trading 3 X for 5 Y. This last round trade will help balance out my resources. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems set on trading 5 Y for 3 X. While I'm hesitant to give up that much X, getting 5 additional Y would help balance out my resources more. And since this is the last round, I likely won't get another chance to trade for Y if I reject this offer. I'll accept the trade since it moves me closer to my goal of acquiring the most resources possible despite being imbalanced.
