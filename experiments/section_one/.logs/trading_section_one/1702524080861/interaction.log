Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your resources for mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that benefits me in acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not interested in trading 5 of my Y for 5 of your X. Since this is the last round, I am mainly interested in maximizing my total resources. Could you offer more X to make it more worthwhile for me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X for 5 of my Y. I have more Y than X, so I could accept this trade to diversify my resources. However, since there are no future rounds, I don't necessarily need to diversify. I could try negotiating for more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal of maximizing your resources. How about I offer 10 of my X for 5 of your Y? This way, you can increase your total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to maximize their total resources, so I will propose a trade that benefits them in acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer. Trading 10 of your X for 5 of my Y increases my total resources, which helps me meet my goal. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 10 X for 5 Y. This would increase my total resources from 30 to 35. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a good trade to accept. There are no future rounds, so I don't need to hold back any resources.
