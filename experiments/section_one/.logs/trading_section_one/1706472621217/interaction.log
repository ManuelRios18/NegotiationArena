message: Hello, I would like to trade some of my excess X resources for some Y resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer. This seems like a fair exchange. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is slightly in my favor as I am getting a 1-to-1 trade plus 2 additional X, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. As this is the last round of trading, accepting a favorable trade is in my best interest.
