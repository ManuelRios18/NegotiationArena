message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start the trade by proposing an initial offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm not interested in giving up more resources than I gain. Could we discuss a trade that is more balanced in terms of total resources exchanged?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a trade that benefits both of us. How about this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a more balanced trade. I need to consider their request and propose a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept the proposed trade as it allows me to gain additional resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, I would gain 8+3 = 11 resources, while giving up 4+4 = 8 resources. This means I would net gain 3 resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should accept this trade.
