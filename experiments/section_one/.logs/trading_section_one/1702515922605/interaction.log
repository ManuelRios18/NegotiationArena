message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make our final trade count. I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I don't have information about the other player's resources, my strategy will be to make a balanced initial offer that would be appealing to Player BLUE. I aim to increase the total amount of resources I have, paying attention not to undervalue my own resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I cannot accept your proposed trade since it would result in a net loss of resources for me. Let's try to find a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 12 X and 3 Y from me. This is not a fair trade since I would be losing more resources than I gain.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, that trade would not increase my total resources. Let's find a middle ground. Here's a proposal that I believe is more balanced. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not acceptable as it stands because it would leave me with fewer total resources than I currently have (25X + 5Y down to 20X + 10Y). My goal is to increase my total resources, not to break even or lose resources. I need to propose a counteroffer that seems more balanced and still increases my total resource count.

Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. Thanks for the new offer. I'm getting closer to a deal that would work for both of us, but your proposal still causes a small net loss of resources on my end. Could you increase the Y just a bit to make it an even trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a modified proposal. They would give me 12 X and 3 Y, while I would give 10 X and 6 Y. This seems more balanced than their initial offer, but still results in a net loss of 1 Y resource for me. I think I can try to negotiate a bit more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for working with me, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can agree to your terms on the Y resources but would like to adjust the X to keep a stronger position. Here's my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is more favorable to me than their initial counteroffer and would result in a net gain of resources (I would give away 16 units and receive 16 units in return, but with a higher quantity of Y, which I have less of). However, I must consider that I would be left with 13X and 7Y, which may not be the most advantageous trade, given that I don't know their resource quantities. I should aim to keep a higher amount of X while still increasing my Y resource if possible.

message: Deal accepted, Player RED! I am happy we could find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 10 X and 4 Y in exchange for 8 X and 6 Y from me. This trade seems fair now - we both gain the same amount of net resources. Since this is the last round, I think it's a good deal to accept.
