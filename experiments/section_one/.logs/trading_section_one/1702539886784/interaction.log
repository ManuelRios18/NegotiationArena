message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out since this is the last round. Please let me know if you'd like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still giving the other player an incentive to accept. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could propose giving some X in exchange for Y.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. The trade seems fair, and I'm happy to accept it. It was great trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade offers me more of resource X, which I have less of, and takes a small amount of resource Y, which I have in abundance. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count and align with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
