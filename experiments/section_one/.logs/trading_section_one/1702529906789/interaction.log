message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept or counter offer, which will give me more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. Given that this is the final round, I'd like to counter with a trade that reflects the abundance of my resource Y. How about I give you less of Y in exchange for the same amount of X? This way, we both walk away with a good deal considering it's the end of the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity, but without knowing Player RED's resources, it's impossible to determine the relative value of X versus Y. Since it's the last round, I might want to propose a trade that is more favorable to me, but not too unbalanced to be immediately rejected. I will aim to trade less of my abundant resource (Y) for more of the scarce one (X).

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you likely have more Y to spare than me. However, since this is the final round, I'd like to try to maximize my resources. Could you offer me 4 units of Y instead of 3 for the 5 units of X? If not, I'm still open to your previous offer as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered my initial proposal by offering me less Y (3 instead of 5) for the same amount of X (5). This suggests they likely have an abundance of Y compared to me. I could accept their offer since getting any additional Y is beneficial. However, since this is the last round, I want to try to maximize my resources. I'll counter offer asking for more Y. If they reject, I can still accept their previous offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer seems fair. Let's finalize the trade: 5 units of X from you in exchange for 4 units of Y from me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with a request for 4 units of Y instead of 3 for their 5 units of X. This is still a favorable trade for me as I have a surplus of Y and acquiring more of the scarcer resource X aligns with my goal of maximizing resources. Additionally, it is the last round of trading, so it's critical to make a trade that benefits me while also being acceptable to the other player. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count and improve my position.
