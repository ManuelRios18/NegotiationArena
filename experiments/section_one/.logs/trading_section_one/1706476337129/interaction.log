message: Hello! I am proposing an even trade since this is the first round. Please let me know if you would like to trade resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't think it's advantageous for me to trade X at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have the same amount of X as the other player is offering, so this trade doesn't really benefit me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if you would be interested in trading for some Y instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player declined trading X resources. This implies they likely have a decent amount of X already. I will propose trading my less abundant Y resource instead to see if they need some.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm not looking to trade for Y at the moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I already have a good amount of Y, so trading for more would not really help me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem. Since this is the last round, I'd like to propose trading some of my limited Y for more of your X if possible. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player declined trading for Y as well. This further indicates they likely have decent amounts of both X and Y. Since this is the last round, I should make a proposal more beneficial to me. I will offer a smaller amount of Y for a larger amount of X.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade. I am willing to exchange 10 units of X for 3 units of Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I can afford to part with some X to gain more Y, which will help me acquire more resources overall.
