Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing the first trade offer. Let's have a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered is not ideal for me as I already have 5 units of X and I want to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to acquire more resources. Here is a new offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counter offer. Since they said they want to acquire more resources, I will propose a trade more favorable to them by offering more of my excess resource X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort, but I need to receive resources in return to make a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is still not favorable for me as I would be giving away a resource without gaining any in return.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's try this offer - I will give you a good amount of X if you can spare even a small amount of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not willing to give up any Y unless they receive some X in return. I still have 15 more proposals of X I could make, so I will propose trading even more X in order to get some Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept the offer. I'm willing to exchange 3 units of Y for 15 units of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is more appealing as I would receive a good amount of X in exchange for a small amount of Y.
