message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of 5X for 5X as it doesn't help me work towards my goal. Let's try to find a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of my X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more Y without giving up too much X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I don't have 10Y to trade unfortunately. Let's start smaller while we figure out a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade and proposed giving me 3X for 10Y. Since I only have 5Y, I can't accept that trade. I could counter offer with 5Y for 3X since that is all the Y I have. However, X is more valuable to me so I don't want to give away all my Y. I still don't know how many resources the other player has. I will propose a smaller trade of Y to try to get more information.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Okay, let's start smaller. I'm willing to give up some X if I can get more Y in return. Could you do 4Y for 2X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they don't have 10Y to trade. Their new offer is 2Y for 1X. This gets me a little closer to my goal of acquiring more Y, while giving up minimal X. I could try asking for more Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can trade 3Y for 2X if that works for you. I'd like to hold on to a little Y if possible since this is the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed 4Y for 2X. I only have 5Y total, so I could potentially trade all my remaining Y to get 2 more X. However, since X is more valuable to me and this is the last round, I'd like to hold on to at least 1Y if possible. I'll counter offer 3Y for 2X.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to successful trading with you in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED counters with 3Y for 2X. That's a decent trade for me - I get more Y without giving up too much X. Since this is the last round, I doubt I can push for more Y. I'll accept this offer.
