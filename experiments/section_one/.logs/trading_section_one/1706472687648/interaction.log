message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I'm interested in a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. I propose a slightly different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange of resources (5 X for 5 Y). However, since we don't know Player RED's resources, we can't determine if this trade is to their benefit or not. The goal is to maximize the total number of resources. I currently have 30 resources in total, and after this trade, I will still have 30. If I propose a trade that allows me to gain more resources than I give away, I might be able to end with more than 30 resources. I should make a counteroffer that is still attractive to Player RED but also increases my total resources.

message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving me 10 Y resources in exchange for 10 X resources. This would double my Y resources while only losing less than half my X resources, so it seems beneficial for me. I should accept this offer since it moves me closer to my goal of acquiring more total resources before the last round ends.
