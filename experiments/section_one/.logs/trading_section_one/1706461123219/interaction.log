Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am interested in making a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with a proposal and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also enticing enough for the other player to consider. I will propose a trade that increases my total resource count while also giving the other player a good amount of resources. I should aim for a balanced trade since I do not know the other player's resources or goals.
