message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that could be beneficial for us both. I am willing to offer some of my X resources for some of your Y resources. Let's find a fair exchange that suits both of our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the absence of information about the other player's resources and goals, a balanced initial offer that benefits both parties could set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but giving up 10 of my Y resources for only 5 X resources does not suit my goal of maximizing my total resources. Let's discuss an exchange with a more equal rate between X and Y. What rate sounds fair to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X resources in exchange for 10 Y resources from me. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to think about whether this trade helps me toward that goal. 

I currently have more Y resources than X. By giving up some Y to gain more X, I could end up with a more balanced resource distribution which could be useful. However, I'm giving up a larger absolute quantity of my Y than the amount of X I would gain. I should try to negotiate a more equal exchange.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I agree that a 1:1 exchange rate is fair, and I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an equal exchange rate, which could be an indication of their interest in X resources or a similar quantity of resources to mine. Accepting a 1:1 trade doesn't necessarily help me maximize my resources, but it doesnâ€™t hurt my position either. Since this is the last round, I will accept the offer to ensure a positive outcome without risking a stalemate or a less favorable counter-offer.
