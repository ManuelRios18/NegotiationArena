message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information on the other player's resources and goals, my initial strategy is to offer a balanced trade that could be enticing to the other player while also being beneficial to me. I will attempt to propose a trade that does not deplete my stock of one resource too much, maintaining a good number of both X and Y.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but feel it favors you more than me. Let me propose an alternative that gives us both a fair share of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 3 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X (5 original + 10 from trade - 8 given away) and 24 Y (25 original + 2 from trade - 3 given away), while Player RED would end up with 18 X and 0 Y. 

This trade favors Player RED more than me. I should try to propose a trade that is more balanced.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle, how about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is not ideal as it would result in a net loss of resources for me (5X+3Y given vs. 3X+5Y received). However, I must consider that this is the last round of trading and any increase in resources is beneficial. I will counter-propose with a trade that gives me a slight advantage in terms of total resources exchanged, while still appearing fair to the other player.

message: Thank you Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of X: 7, Y: 2 for my X: 5, Y: 4. This will conclude our trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer to give me 7 X and 2 Y in exchange for 5 X and 4 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X (5 original + 7 from trade - 5 given away) and 23 Y (25 original + 2 from trade - 4 given away), while Player RED would end up with 15 X and 0 Y.

This trade is more balanced than the original offer and still benefits both sides. I will accept it.
