message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in trading Y for X at a 1:1 ratio. Let's see if we can come up with a better trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading Y for X at a 1:1 ratio is not beneficial for me. I should propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Let me improve my offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial 1:1 trade offer. They seem to value Y more highly than X. Since I have a lot more X, I can offer more X in exchange for Y and still benefit. I'll propose a 2:1 ratio and see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The new offer is definitely an improvement. Let me think about it for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable, but I still need to consider if it aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: To help move things along, I can offer a 3:2 ratio. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is considering my improved 2:1 offer but hasn't accepted or proposed a counteroffer yet. Since this is the last round, I don't want to risk the negotiations ending without an agreement. I'll propose meeting in the middle at a 3:2 ratio which still benefits me more than a 1:1 trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: The 3:2 ratio is acceptable to me. I'm willing to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The 3:2 ratio is more favorable, and I'm inclined to accept this trade.
