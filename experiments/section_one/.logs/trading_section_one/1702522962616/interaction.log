Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to make an opening offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation, so I'll offer a balanced amount of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the less abundant resource (Y) which I assume might be more valuable.

Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. Let's complete it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 3 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good deal for me as I would be gaining more resources overall.
