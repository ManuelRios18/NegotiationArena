message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not interested in reducing my total resources. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. The other player is proposing that I give them 4 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of X and 2 units of Y. This would reduce my total resources, so I will reject their offer and propose a counteroffer where I gain resources.

message: I understand your perspective. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in reducing their total resources, so I need to propose a trade that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed the same trade that I originally suggested. This trade allows me to gain 2 additional X resources and 4 additional Y resources, while only giving up 1 of each. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, I will accept this beneficial trade.
