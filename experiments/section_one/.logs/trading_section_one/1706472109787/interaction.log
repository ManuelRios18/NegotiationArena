message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, let's start with a smaller trade first to build some trust. I have some Y available to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to trade 5 units of it. However, I'm not sure if this is a fair trade or if Player RED actually has 5 units of X to give me. I'll propose a smaller trade first to test it out.

message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the willingness to start small. I'm open to the trade, but I was hoping for a slightly larger exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a smaller trade to start with. I could accept this trade, but I'd like to see if I can negotiate for a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted! Thank you for the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED seems willing to trade 4 units of X. I'm okay with trading 4 units of Y to get more X. This helps me work towards my goal of acquiring more total resources.
