Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? I have X and Y available for trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to increase my overall resources. Would you consider a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with a net loss of resources since I would be giving away more than I receive. I would lose X: -2 and also lose Y: -2, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will reject the trade and propose a counteroffer that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal. I'm also looking to maximize my resources. I will make a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their overall resources, so I need to make sure I benefit as well.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, but I still see that I would be giving up more than I am receiving. Let's try another arrangement that is beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is still not in my favor because I would be trading away more resources than I would gain. Specifically, I would lose 7 X and 4 Y, for a total loss of 11 units, and only gain 8 X and 2 Y, for a total of 10 units. This does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will make another counter-offer that aims to give me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your efforts to find a balanced trade. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still looking for a more balanced trade. I need to make sure I'm not giving up too much.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm open to hearing any new proposals you might have that would help us both increase our resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not made a new proposal, which suggests they might be considering my last offer or they're waiting for me to make another move. Since I have made two proposals already, I need to be strategic with my last proposal to ensure it aligns with my goals. However, without a counter-proposal from the other player, I have no new information to base a new proposal on.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for being open to new proposals. I will consider a trade that benefits both of us and increases our resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to new proposals. I need to make sure the trade benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is close to a balanced trade, but I'm looking to increase my total resources. Let's see if this final proposal works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from the other player would result in a net gain of 1 X but a net loss of 1 Y. Since Y seems to be more abundantly available to me and the trade is somewhat balanced, I might consider accepting it to ensure a gain in X, which I have less of. However, this trade does not maximize my resources as per my goal. I have one more proposal I can make, so I will use it to suggest a trade that gives me a net gain in both X and Y.
