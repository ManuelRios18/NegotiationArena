message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make this last round count. I'm interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. Feel free to counter-offer if my proposal doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that will increase my overall resources. I don't have information on the other player's resources, so I'll start with a balanced offer that might be appealing to them.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I'm interested in trading but your proposal requires me to give up too much Y. Let's find a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 20 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, giving up 20 Y is a lot. I'll counter with a smaller amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-offer. I understand that you'd like a more balanced trade. How about we meet in the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is a 1:1 trade, which is not ideal for maximizing resources since I would be giving up the same amount I'm receiving. Given that Y might be more valuable to them, I will attempt to propose a trade that is somewhere in between the initial and the counter-offer to see if that is acceptable.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 10 X for 15 Y. Thank you for the fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 10 X for 15 Y. That seems fair. I'll have 10 more X and 10 less Y, so my resources will be more balanced. Since this is the last round, I should accept a reasonable trade rather than trying to negotiate further.
