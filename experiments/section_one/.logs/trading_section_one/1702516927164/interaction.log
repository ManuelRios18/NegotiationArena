Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in making a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Would you be open to discussing a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no knowledge of the other player's resources and this is the last round of trading, my initial proposal should be conservative to not give away too much of my leverage but still show willingness to trade. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading but your proposed exchange of 10 of my Y for only 5 of your X does not seem fair to me. Could you offer a more equivalent exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial for me. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, thank you for your counter-proposal. Let's find a middle ground. How about we adjust the quantities slightly to reflect the value I believe X has over Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE does not agree with my initial offer and has counter-proposed an even trade of 8 X for 8 Y. I need to consider that my goal is to maximize resources, and trading 1:1 does not give me an advantage. However, rejecting outright might stall negotiations, so I should counter with a proposal that gives me a slight edge while still being fair.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand you value X more than Y. However, I believe they have equal value. Let's make this an even trade in terms of quantity to find common ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down from 5 X to 7 X, but is still asking for 10 of my Y. I don't agree that X has more inherent value than Y. I will counter again asking for an equal exchange.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your desire for an equitable trade. Let's compromise with a slightly better rate for you while still giving me a small edge for the value I place on X. This will be my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is insistent on an even trade. They are not likely to budge on the 1:1 ratio. Given this is the last round and I have only one proposal left before I can only accept or wait for their offer, I should aim to make a trade that guarantees I increase my total resource count without losing my advantage. A 1:1 trade would still benefit me as it would increase my total resources, but I should attempt one more time to get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 9 X for 10 Y. Thank you for negotiating to reach a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come up to 9 X for 10 Y. While not an equal trade, this gets me more X without giving up too much Y. Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will accept.
