message: Hello other player. Let's have a mutually beneficial trade in this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of the other player accepting. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 15 X resources in exchange for 10 Y resources from me. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would gain more resources overall.
