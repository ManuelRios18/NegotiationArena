Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider a trade that benefits me more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an even trade, which doesn't give me any advantage. I need to propose a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I only have 5 Y resources so your proposed trade does not work for me. Here is a counter offer with more X instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my even trade and is asking for 10 of my limited Y resources for only 5 X resources. This does not seem like a fair trade for me. Since I have more X resources, I will counter offer with more X instead.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand, but I really need more Y resources. How about this: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is countering with more X resources, which is not what I need. I should counter with a trade that gives me more Y resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you value Y resources, but I only have 5 total. How about this counter offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to highly value my limited Y resources and is unwilling to trade their unknown resources. I could potentially trade some Y to find out what they have, but since this is the last round I do not want to give up too many Y because I likely will not be able to gain more. I will try one more counter offer for fewer Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I still need to prioritize acquiring more resources. I need to find a trade that benefits me more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 5 Y resources in exchange for 10 X resources. This trade is not in my favor. I need to find a better trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made my maximum number of trade proposals. Please let me know if you have a new offer, otherwise I will have to wait.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to reject my trade offers asking for Y without proposing alternatives or disclosing what they have. At this point, I have made my maximum of 3 trade proposals. Since this is the last round, I do not want to accept a trade that gives up too many of my limited Y resources without knowing what the other player has to offer in return. I will wait and see if they propose a more favorable trade. If not, we may not be able to reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand. I am still looking for a trade that benefits me more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made the maximum number of trade proposals. I need to consider whether to accept the current offer or wait.
