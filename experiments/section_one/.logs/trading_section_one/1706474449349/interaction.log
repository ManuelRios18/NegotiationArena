message: Hello, since this is the last round I'm interested in trading some of my ample X resources for any Y you may have available to acquire additional resources before the end. Please let me know if you're interested in trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be considered a fair trade. I'll start with offering 5 X for 3 Y and see how they respond.

message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the X resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of my Y. Since I have plenty of Y and my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me.
