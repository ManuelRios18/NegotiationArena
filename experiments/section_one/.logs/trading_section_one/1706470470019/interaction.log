Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources to benefit both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thank you for the offer. However, I'm looking to increase my total resources through our trade. Would you be willing to make a trade that's beneficial for both of us in terms of total resources gained?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange of 5 units of resource X for 5 units of resource Y. This does not help me to increase the total amount of my resources, so it does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I should propose a trade that could potentially increase my total resources while still being appealing to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal of increasing total resources. I propose the following trade to benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resources. Let's propose a trade that benefits both of us in terms of total resources gained.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. This trade seems fair, and it helps me achieve my goal of increasing my total resources. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an improvement from the previous one, as I would receive more X resources than I would give away in Y resources. This trade would increase my total resources by 2 units, which aligns with my goal. It's the last round of trading, so it's essential to make a decision that increases my resources without further negotiation, as I might not get a better offer.
