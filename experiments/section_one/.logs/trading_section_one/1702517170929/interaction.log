message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an exchange where I give you a substantial amount of resource X, which I have in abundance, for some of your resource Y. I believe this will be a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, it's important to make an offer that is appealing to the other player while also maximizing my gains. I should start with a proposal that gives me a net positive in resources, but isn't so unbalanced that it would be immediately rejected. I don't know the other player's resources, so I'll aim for a balanced trade that offers more of my abundant resource in exchange for more of the scarce one.

message: Thank you for the generous offer Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X for only 3 units of Y. Since X and Y are the only resources in the game, getting more of either is good for me. 10 units of X for 3 units of Y seems like a very good deal. I should accept this trade.
