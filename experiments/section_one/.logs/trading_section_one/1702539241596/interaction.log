Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's trade equal amounts to get started. What resources do you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I am looking to diversify my resources. I have an ample supply of resource Y. Would you be interested in some of that instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed a trade of equal amounts of resource X. Since this would not increase my total resources, it does not align with my goals. However, I can use this opportunity to propose a trade that could be beneficial for both parties if I offer some of my abundant resource Y in exchange for more of their resource X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm interested in trading for some of your Y. However, your proposed trade feels a bit unequal. Let's do an even exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to have a lot of resource Y and is looking to trade some of it. Since I only have 5 units of Y, getting more would help diversify my resources. However, the proposed trade is unequal - they want 10 units of my main resource X in exchange for 20 units of Y. I could counter offer a more equal trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: An even exchange sounds good. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered a 1:1 trade for resource X and Y. This trade would not increase my total number of resources, but it would increase the diversity of my resources, which could be beneficial. Since this is the last round, I should consider accepting a fair trade to ensure I don't end up with an unfavorable or no trade at all.
