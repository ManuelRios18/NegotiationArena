message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a fair trade to benefit us both. I propose a trade where we both give some resources but still retain enough for ourselves. What do you think about the following exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I'll propose a balanced trade to open negotiations. I will offer fewer resources than I have to leave room for negotiation and to not deplete my resources too quickly.

message: Hello Player RED. I understand you want a fair trade, but your offer requires me to give up more of my valuable X resource. I only have 5 units while you have an unknown amount. Could you propose a trade where we exchange equal amounts of X? That seems fair to both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing that I give up more of my limited X resource than they are. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to make a trade that is more balanced or favors me getting more resources.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your need for an equal exchange of X. I'm willing to do that. However, I would like to propose a different trade to ensure we both feel the exchange is balanced. How about we keep the X exchange equal and adjust the Y a bit more in my favor?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has revealed they only have 5 units of X. They are looking for an equal exchange of X resources. The proposed trade is not beneficial as it stands because I would be giving more Y than I am receiving. I want to counter-propose with a trade that gives me more of the X resource while keeping the exchange of Y resources favorable to me, considering I only have 5 units to start with.

message: That trade for equal X and slightly more Y from me works. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has agreed to an equal 1-to-1 exchange of X resources. However, they now want more Y resources from me. I have a lot more Y than they likely do, so I can afford to give up a bit more Y to help make the trade appealing to them. As long as I get an equal amount of X, giving up some extra Y should allow me to complete the trade and acquire more total resources.
