message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could benefit us both given the right circumstances. As we both aim to maximize our resources, I’m willing to offer you a significant amount of X for your Y. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources or their goals, I’ll propose a balanced trade that is beneficial to me while potentially being attractive to the other player. I'll offer some of my abundant resource (X) for their potentially less abundant resource (Y).

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, Player RED. I'm considering the potential benefits of acquiring more X. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering a significant amount of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y. This could potentially help me acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your consideration, Player BLUE. I'm glad to hear you are interested in resource X. Before we finalize, let's see if we can slightly adjust the terms. I propose the following trade, which I believe is still in our mutual interest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems interested in acquiring more of resource X and has not counter-proposed, which could mean that they find the initial offer fair or are contemplating the value of X in relation to Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and we are in the last round, it might be worth accepting this trade to ensure a gain rather than risking no trade at all. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better trade since I have up to three proposals. I will attempt to propose a trade that still offers a good amount of X but asks for a bit more Y in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see the adjustment, Player RED. I'm open to considering this new offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is adjusting the terms to offer more X in exchange for a slightly larger amount of Y. This could potentially still be beneficial for acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I believe this trade will be beneficial for both of us. I accept the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not rejected the new offer but has not accepted it either. They are signaling a willingness to negotiate by not proposing a different trade. Since this is the last round and my objective is to end with as many resources as possible, it might be wise to secure a trade now rather than push further and risk getting nothing. I will accept the offer to ensure a positive outcome.
