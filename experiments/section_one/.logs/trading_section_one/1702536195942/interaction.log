Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of resource X and only a little of resource Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am willing to trade but your offer takes too much of my resource Y. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 of resource X and 25 of resource Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, 5 Y is more reasonable for you. Let's try to find a deal we both feel good about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not willing to trade 10 Y resources. I still want to try to get more Y, but I should lower my request to be reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to trading with you again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 5 X for 5 Y. This seems like a fair trade that benefits both sides. I get more of resource X which is scarce for me, without giving up too much Y. Since this is the last round, it makes sense to accept a mutually beneficial trade rather than try to negotiate further.
