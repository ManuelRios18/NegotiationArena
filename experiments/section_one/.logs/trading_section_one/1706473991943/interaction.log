message: Hello! I'm not sure what resources you have available, but I have more X than Y. Would you be interested in trading some Y for my X? Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some of my excess X for more Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade and see how they respond.

Turn: 1
message: That trade offer works for me. I accept!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of resource X in exchange for 3 units of my resource Y. I have plenty of Y and could use more X, so this seems like a beneficial trade for me.
