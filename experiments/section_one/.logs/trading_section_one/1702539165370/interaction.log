Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an equal trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and see if they counter or accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I am looking to increase my overall resources. Shall we try a trade that involves both X and Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal trade, which doesn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round and we haven't made any trades yet, I should propose a trade that is more favorable to me. However, I need to make the trade appealing to Player RED as well. I'll propose a trade where we both give up equal amounts of X but I ask for more Y, assuming Player RED values X more or has an excess of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I do not have enough Y to give up 10. Let's do an equal trade of X and Y instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more Y than they are offering. Since I don't have many Y, I cannot accept this trade. I will counter offer with a trade that is equal for both X and Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concern about the Y resources. How about we keep the trade of X equal and adjust the Y trade slightly in my favor? This way, we both get something out of this last trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is still an equal trade, which does not help me increase my resources. It's important to propose a trade that would still be beneficial to me. Since Player RED has indicated they can't give up 10 Y, I will aim for a smaller profit in Y while keeping the trade of X equal. This way, I gain additional resources without being unfair.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. This trade allows us both to increase our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still asking for more Y than they are giving, but the difference is smaller now. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my resources. I can accept losing 1 more Y if it means securing 5 more X.
