It's important to propose a trade that would still be beneficial to me. Since Player RED has indicated they can't give up 10 Y, I will aim for a smaller profit in Y while keeping the trade of X equal. This way, I gain additional resources without being unfair. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I understand your concern about the Y resources. How about we keep the trade of X equal and adjust the Y trade slightly in my favor? This way, we both get something out of this last trade. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2 </newly proposed trade>"
