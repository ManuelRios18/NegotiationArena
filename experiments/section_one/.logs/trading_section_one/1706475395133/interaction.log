message: Hello! Let's see if we can work out a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of resource X and 5 units of resource Y. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose trades that benefit me.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. I would like to counter with a proposal that reflects my goal of increasing my total resources. Let's consider a trade where the exchange rate benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is offering an equal exchange in terms of quantity, but without knowing the value of X and Y relative to each other, it's hard to determine if this is a fair trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to propose a counteroffer that allows me to increase my total number of resources. I will suggest a trade that gives me more X in exchange for Y, as I have a larger quantity of Y to trade with. This is my first proposal out of the allowed three.

message: Deal accepted. I look forward to trading with you again.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE countered my initial offer and proposed trading 8 of my X resources for 10 of their Y resources. This seems like a fair exchange rate that helps us both meet our goals of acquiring more total resources. I could try to negotiate a better rate for myself since I have more proposals left, but since this is the last round, it's better for me to accept a mutually beneficial trade rather than risk no trade at all if I try to negotiate too much.
