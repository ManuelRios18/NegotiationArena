message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing the following trade for our mutual benefit in the final round. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the trade proposal, but I need to evaluate if it aligns with my goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I need to consider if this trade benefits my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need to evaluate if the trade works for you. Could you please let me know what resources you have available and what your goals are? That would help me propose something that benefits both of us in this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They may be evaluating if my proposal aligns with their goals. I should try to get more information and see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.

message: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to know my resources and goals to propose a trade that benefits both of us. I should consider sharing my resources and goals to facilitate a mutually beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you have low X and high Y, and I have high X and low Y, I think we could help each other out. I propose trading some of my surplus X to you for some of your surplus Y. This way we both end up with more resources overall. Please let me know if you would accept this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that I know the other player's resources, I see that they have very little X compared to me, but a lot of Y that I am lacking. I can propose trading some of my ample X resources to them in exchange for some of their plentiful Y. This will increase both of our total resources.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a trade that would allow us both to end up with more resources overall. I should evaluate if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: You're right to carefully evaluate the trade. Let me explain why trading 15 of my X for 10 of your Y would help us both end up with more total resources:

I would go from 25 X & 5 Y, to 10 X & 15 Y. So my total resources would increase from 30 to 25.  

You would go from 5 X & 25 Y, to 20 X & 15 Y. Your total resources would increase from 30 to 35.

So by trading surplus resources, we both maximize our total resources for this final round. Please let me know if this makes sense!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player reiterated that they have 5 X and 25 Y, and are still evaluating if my proposal helps them meet their goal of acquiring the most resources. I should explain why this trade is mutually beneficial for that goal.
