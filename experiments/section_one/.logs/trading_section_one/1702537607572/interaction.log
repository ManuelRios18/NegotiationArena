message: Hello, since this is the last round, let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. As this is the last round, I would like to counter-propose a trade that I believe would be equitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade of 5 units of X in exchange for 2 units of Y seems beneficial as it would increase my total resource count and balance my resources. However, I must consider that this is the last round of trading, and I should aim to maximize my gains. I don't know Player RED's resources, so proposing an alternative trade that is slightly more in my favor could still be seen as reasonable, given our mutual goal for a beneficial trade.

message: I accept your counter-offer. Thank you for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with giving only 1 Y instead of 2. I still think getting more Y is beneficial for me. I could counter-offer by reducing the X I give. However, since this is the last round I don't want to risk the other player walking away. I will accept their offer of 5 X for 1 Y.
