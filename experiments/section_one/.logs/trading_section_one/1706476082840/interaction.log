Turn: 0
message: Hello, since this is the last round, let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to make a trade that benefits me as well. Let's try a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade doesn't benefit me as it involves giving away Y, which I have less of. I should propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thanks for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 3 X and all 5 of my Y in exchange for 7 Y. This would leave me with 22 X and 7 Y. I was hoping to get more Y without giving up so much X, but since this is the last round I should try to make a trade. Getting 7 more Y is better than no trade at all.
