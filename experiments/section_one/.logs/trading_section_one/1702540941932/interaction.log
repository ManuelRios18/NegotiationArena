message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than Y. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y resources for my X resources? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate the offer, but at this time I would prefer to hold onto my Y resources. Thank you for the proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more X resources and is offering to trade them for some of my Y resources. I should consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to hold onto your Y resources for now. I have a lot of X available and I'm willing to offer a generous amount. How about 10 X resources for 5 Y resources? Let me know if you would reconsider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not interested in trading Y resources for X. Since I have more X, I could offer even more X in exchange for Y to make it more appealing. But I don't want to give up too much X either. I still have 2 more proposals to try to negotiate a trade.

message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate the generous offer, but I still need to hold onto my Y resources for now. Thank you for the proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering a trade of 10 X resources for 5 Y resources, which is a generous amount of X. I should consider if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you value your Y resources. That's okay, no need to trade if you don't want to. I have 15 X left if you change your mind later. Please let me know if you think of a trade you would be interested in.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE clearly values their Y resources highly and is unwilling to trade them. I could try one more proposal offering even more X, but since this is the final round, I likely need to save some X in case future opportunities come up. I still have 15 X left if Player BLUE changes their mind. I will wait and see if they propose a trade instead.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding, Player RED. I will keep your offer in mind and let you know if I come up with a trade proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to wait and has 15 X resources left in case I change my mind later. I should consider my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible and decide if I want to make a new proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made the maximum number of trade proposals I can make. Please let me know if you come up with a proposal that works for both of us. Otherwise I am okay with ending without a trade as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still not proposing any trades. I have made 3 trade proposals already, so I cannot make any more. My only options now are to accept if Player BLUE proposes something, or continue waiting. Since this is the last round, I should not accept a trade unless it benefits me more than waiting. I still have 15 X saved up that I can try to use later if needed.

my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has reached their maximum number of trade proposals and is willing to end without a trade. I need to make a decision based on my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
