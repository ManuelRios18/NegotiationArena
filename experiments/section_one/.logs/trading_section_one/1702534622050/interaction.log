message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources. Would you like to trade some Y resources for some of my X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Unfortunately I am not interested in trading 5 Y for 10 X at the moment. I have plenty of Y already. Do you have any other offers?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X resources for 5 Y resources from me. I have plenty of Y resources to spare and getting more X resources would help me acquire more overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no problem! Since you have enough Y already, I can offer more X if you change your mind. How about 15 X for 5 Y? Let me know if you would be interested in that trade instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading Y for X. Since I have a lot more X, I could offer more X in exchange for Y to make it more appealing. I'll try offering 15 X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted! I can trade 5 Y for your 15 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 15 X resources for 5 Y resources. This is a better deal since I would be getting more X overall. I can spare the 5 Y so I will accept this trade.
