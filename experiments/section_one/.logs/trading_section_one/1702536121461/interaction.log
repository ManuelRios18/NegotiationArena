message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 of my X resources for 3 of your Y resources. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 3 Y and see if it gets accepted or countered.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but would like more information on how many X and Y resources you have before making a decision. Could you please share that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X resources for 3 of my Y resources. Since I have more Y resources, I could potentially trade some Ys and still have a lot left over. However, I don't know how many X and Y resources Player RED has.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have 25 X resources and 5 Y resources. Please let me know if you would like to counter my offer of 5 X for 3 Y based on this information.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has asked how many resources I have before deciding on the trade. Since this is the last round, I should disclose my resources to increase my chances of an acceptable trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for sharing your resource amounts. I can offer 10 Y resources for 15 of your X resources. This way we both end up with a more balanced mix. Please let me know if you would accept this counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that I know Player RED has 25 X and 5 Y, I can make a better judgement on the trade. Since I have a lot more Y than them, I could trade some of my Ys for their Xs and we would both end up with more balanced amounts.

message: I accept your counteroffer of 10 Y resources for 15 of my X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with 10 Y for 15 X. This gives me 10 more Y which is good, but I lose 15 X so have less total resources. However, they seem unwilling to accept less than a 1:1.5 ratio trade. I could counter again asking for 12 Y, but they may not accept. I think at this point I should just accept their offer since it still gives me more Y which was my original goal.
