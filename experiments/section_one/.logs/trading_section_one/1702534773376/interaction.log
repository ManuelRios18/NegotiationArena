message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. But I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your offer does not provide enough benefit for me. Let me counter propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a reasonable trade to consider.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can trade some X but your proposal asks for too much from me. Let me counter back with less X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player counter offered asking for 10 X in exchange for 5 Y. That seems like a lot to give up for me. I still have 20 proposals left so I'll counter back asking for less.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 7 units of X for 5 units of my Y. This provides me more X compared to their initial offer, while still costing me less Y than what I had asked for. Since I want to maximize my resources, this seems like a good deal to accept.
