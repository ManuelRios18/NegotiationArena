Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade to mutually benefit our resource pools. Would you be interested in an even exchange to get things started?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to make an initial trade proposal to the other player that is slightly in my favor but still appears fair to encourage them to accept or propose a counteroffer. I don't know the other player's resources, so I'll start with a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade as it is a fair and even exchange that will help me balance my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more of resource Y and less of resource X, so I need to balance my resources. The proposed trade is fair and will help me achieve my goal.
