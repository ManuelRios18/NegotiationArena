message: Hello, let's trade resources evenly to benefit both of us in this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking for a trade that would give us both a net gain in resources. Would you be interested in acquiring some of my Y resources in exchange for your X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange of the same resource, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I want to propose a trade that would allow me to increase my overall resource count. I am assuming Player RED might value Y more than X or have a surplus of X, which I could use to my advantage. Therefore, I should propose a trade where I give away less valuable Y for more valuable X. This is my first proposal out of three allowed.

Turn: 0
message: Thanks, that trade helps increase my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 5 Y resources for 10 X resources. Since I have a lot more X resources, this trade would increase my total resources. Even though I'm giving up more X resources, gaining some Y resources is beneficial since I currently have very few. This helps me work towards my goal of acquiring more total resources.
