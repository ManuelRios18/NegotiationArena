message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey there! I see you're interested in trading. I'm looking to maximize my resources, so how about we make a small adjustment to your offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange of the same quantity of resources, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a counter-proposal that favors me slightly. However, I should also be careful not to make an unreasonable counteroffer that would be immediately rejected by Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial trade. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade doesn't significantly benefit me in terms of acquiring more resources. I'll make a counter offer.

Turn: 1
message: This trade looks good to me. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a slightly better offer for me, which includes an exchange of their 4 units of X and 2 units of Y for 4 units of my Y. This trade is beneficial as it gives me more resources in total, increasing my X by 4 and only decreasing my Y by 2. I would still retain a large quantity of Y and increase my diversity of resources. Accepting this trade would result in me having 9 units of X and 23 units of Y, which is a net gain. Since this is the last round and the trade is in my favor, I should accept it.
