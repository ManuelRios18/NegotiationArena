message: Hello! I have extra X resources and would be interested in trading some for Y resources. Please let me know if you'd be open to trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that is likely to be accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be considered a fair trade. I'll start with an offer to give 5 X resources in exchange for 3 Y resources and see how they respond.

message: I'm interested in trading for X resources. I can offer you Y resources in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a surplus of Y resources, and acquiring more X resources would help balance my inventory.

message: Great, I have X to spare. Could you offer 5 Y resources for the 5 X I proposed last time? Let me know, thanks!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in X resources and has Y resources to offer in return. Since I have plenty of X, I'm happy to trade some away to get more Y, which I'm short on. I could counter offer asking for more Y resources for the 5 X I originally offered.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

message: Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has agreed to my proposed trade of 5 X resources for 5 Y resources. This meets my goal of acquiring more Y resources that I'm short on, while giving up some X that I have in abundance. Since the trade is beneficial for me, I will accept it.
