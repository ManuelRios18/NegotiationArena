Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't see the benefit in trading X for Y when I already have equal amounts of X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering the same amount. I'm not gaining anything from this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Since you already have a lot of X, I can offer you more to make it a fair trade. How about 10 X for 5 Y? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player says they already have equal amounts of X and Y. That means they likely have more Y than me. I could offer them more X to make it worthwhile for them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the increased offer, but I'm still not interested in trading Y for X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering more X, but I still don't see the benefit in trading Y for X at this point.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you don't want X, would you trade me some of your X for my Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems unwilling to trade Y for X. I could try offering even more X, but at this point it may be better to propose trading my smaller resource, Y, to get more X instead.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm willing to accept the trade. I will give you 10 X in exchange for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering to trade Y for X, which aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources. It's a fair trade, and I can benefit from increasing my Y.
