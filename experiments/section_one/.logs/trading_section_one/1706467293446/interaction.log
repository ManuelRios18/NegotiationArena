Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowing the other player's resources, I aim to make an attractive initial offer that is balanced but also safeguards my interests. I'll propose a trade where I offer more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for a less abundant but perhaps more valuable resource (Y), aiming to increase my overall resource count. I will start by offering a trade that would still leave me with a majority of resource X, in case they have a surplus of Y and are looking for X.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the initial offer, but I currently have more Y than X, and my goal is to acquire more resources in general. I would like to propose a counter offer that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed offers X: 10 in exchange for Y: 3. I have more Y than X, and my goal is to acquire more resources in general. I can propose a counter offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer sounds fair, and it aligns with my goals. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests that they have a surplus of Y and need more of X. Adjusting the trade to give away less of my X for the same amount of Y seems like a good deal, and it aligns with my goal to increase my total resources. Accepting this trade would leave me with 17 X and 8 Y, which is a net gain of one resource. Since this is the last round and the deal seems fair, I will accept it to ensure a gain.
