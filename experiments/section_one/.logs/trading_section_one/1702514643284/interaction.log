message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's make the most of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make an offer that is appealing to Player BLUE but also beneficial to me. I don't have any information on Player BLUE's resources, so I'll make a balanced initial proposal to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This is a fair trade. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.
