This is closer to a balanced trade, but I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal without knowing their resources. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains. I will counter with a trade that gives me a net gain of resources while remaining fair to the other player. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED.
