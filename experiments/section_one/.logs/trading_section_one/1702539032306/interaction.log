message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade to start. Please counter if you would like something different.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept or counter offer, which will give me more information.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. However, an equal exchange does not help me meet my goal of acquiring more resources. I would like to propose a different trade that might be beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange of the same resource, which does not benefit me in terms of acquiring more resources. Therefore, I will reject the offer and propose a trade that involves a different exchange ratio that could potentially be beneficial for both parties, without knowing the other player's resources or goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello, while I understand you want to acquire more resources, the trade you proposed takes too many of my resources without equal compensation. I would like to propose a more fair trade instead that we both benefit from.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial equal trade offer and countered with an unequal trade that favors them. They want me to give up more resources than they are offering. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not help me. I will reject their offer and propose a new trade that is more equal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. I agree that we should aim for a fair trade. However, I would like to propose a slightly altered trade to ensure a net gain for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED still involves an equal exchange of resources, but they have reduced the amounts. This is closer to a balanced trade, but I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal without knowing their resources. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains. I will counter with a trade that gives me a net gain of resources while remaining fair to the other player.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade as it allows us both to gain additional resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with a trade that provides me a net gain in resources while also benefiting them. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this trade helps me achieve that. I will accept their offer.
