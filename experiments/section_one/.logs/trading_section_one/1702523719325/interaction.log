Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to trade some of my resources for a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am willing to consider a fair trade, but your offer does not benefit me. I have more Y than X. Please make another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood. Let me propose a new trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more Y than X, so I need to make an offer that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the improved offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 5 of their resource X for 3 of my Y. This helps balance my resources while still allowing me to retain more Y overall. Since more total resources is my goal, this seems like a beneficial trade.
