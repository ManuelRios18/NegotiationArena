Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if I can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in that trade offer. Let's try to find a deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 5 X and 1 Y in exchange for 3 X and 3 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I can afford to trade away some Y. However, the deal is not beneficial for me since I would be giving up more total resources (3X + 3Y) than I would gain (5X + 1Y). I should try to propose a trade more favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, let's find a mutually beneficial trade. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a trade that would leave me with fewer resources. I need to propose a counter offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted! I look forward to future trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed a better trade offer - they will give me 4 X and 3 Y in exchange for 3 X and 2 Y. This is more favorable for me as I will gain 1 more X resource overall. Since I have a lot of Y resources, I can afford to trade away 2 Y. I should accept this offer.
