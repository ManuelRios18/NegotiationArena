message: Hello, would you be interested in making a trade? Here's my proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. Unfortunately your proposed trade is not beneficial for me at the moment. I would be losing more resources than I gain. Please make another offer if you'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me. I would have to give up more of my valuable resources than I would gain. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should reject this offer.

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible

newly proposed trade: NONE

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I will propose a new trade that I believe will benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is open to considering a fair trade, so I need to carefully craft a proposal that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: This new trade offer seems fair and beneficial for both sides. I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, I would give up 7 X and 3 Y, and gain 6 X and 2 Y. So I would lose 1 more X than I gain, but gain 1 less Y than I give up. Overall this seems like an even trade that helps both sides gain some resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this trade allows me to do that, I will accept it.
