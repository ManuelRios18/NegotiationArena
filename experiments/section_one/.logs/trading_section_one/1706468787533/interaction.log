message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's make the most out of our last trading opportunity. I propose the following trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a trade proposal that leans in my favor but still offers the other player a reasonable amount of resources. I need to ensure that I don't overreach and propose a trade that is so unbalanced that Player BLUE immediately rejects it.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but giving up 15 Y for only 10 X does not help me meet my goal of acquiring more total resources. Let's discuss a more equitable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I would be giving up more total resources than I would gain. I think I can negotiate a better deal.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see your point in seeking an equitable trade. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to reflect the scarcity of resource Y? Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is an even trade, 1-to-1 for X and Y. While it is fair in terms of numbers, it doesn't exploit the full potential of the trading opportunity to maximize my resources. However, since this is the last round, and I have to make the most out of this trade, I will counter with a slightly more favorable trade for me, aiming to gain a net positive in total resources without making the trade seem unbalanced.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 12 X for 10 Y. This is an equitable trade that helps us both gain resources. Thank you for negotiating in good faith!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with giving me 12 X for 10 Y. This improves the trade in my favor while still accounting for the scarcity of Y. I would gain 2 more X resources than I give up in Y. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this trade helps me make progress. I will accept it.
