Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think we can work out a better deal. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade suggests Player RED is offering more X and less Y compared to what they're asking from me. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade seems favorable since I would gain a net of 2 units of resources. However, I must consider if I can propose a trade that would yield an even greater net gain without being rejected. Given that this is the last round, I need to ensure that my proposal is enticing enough for RED to consider.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the new proposal. Let me consider it for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed a trade. I will evaluate the proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Take your time! I'm open to hearing any counter-proposals you might have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player did not accept my proposal but also did not make a counteroffer, it seems as though they are considering their options. I should be prepared to either accept a counter-proposal or to pitch another trade, keeping in mind that my resources and goals should guide the decision. I have already made one proposal, so I have two more I can make before I must only accept or do nothing.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I'm considering the options and will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to carefully consider my next move.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: No problem at all. I'm here and ready to discuss whenever you're ready.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not yet made a decision, so I am still in a position to react to any potential offers or to maintain my stance and wait for a response. Since I have two more proposals I can make, I should be strategic about when to use them, possibly as a response to a new offer from RED.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I've carefully considered the options, and I would like to propose a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It's time to make a decision on the trade proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed the same trade that I initially suggested. This proposal would result in a net gain of resources considering the quantities exchanged. Since the goal is to maximize resources and this is the last trading round, accepting this trade would be beneficial.
