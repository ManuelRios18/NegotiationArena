Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your resource Y for my resource X? Let's start with a simple trade to see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Initially, I should propose a trade that is somewhat balanced but still in my favor. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I should try to trade some of my more abundant resource (X) for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a similar goal. I should also ensure not to give away too much of my resource X as it is still valuable. I will start with a small trade to test the waters.

Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. Let's complete it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be gaining more resources overall.
