message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to get things started. Looking forward to a beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the opening proposal, I want to start with an offer that is somewhat balanced but also benefits me given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I'll propose a trade that assumes the other player might value resource Y higher than X, considering I have less of it.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting things off with an offer, but I would like to propose a different trade that I think could be more mutually beneficial. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 of resource X and 25 of resource Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. However, I believe we can find more common ground. Here is another proposal that I hope will be closer to meeting both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE does not seem beneficial as it does not adhere to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. The ratio of exchange is not favorable to me. I will make a second proposal that's more balanced and keeps the negotiation going without reaching my limit of three proposals too quickly.

message: Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating further. Since you have reduced the amount of X in your offer, I have lowered the Y I am willing to trade accordingly. Please let me know if this trade interests you, or feel free to make another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 5 X for 7 Y. This would result in me having 10 X and 18 Y total. I was originally willing to trade away up to 5 Y to get 10 X. Since their new offer has less X, I think I can counter with less Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand the trade must be appealing to both of us. Let's try to balance our interests with this new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counter-offer from Player BLUE still does not align with my goal to maximize resources. They've offered less Y than I proposed, which isn't beneficial to me. I need to make a third proposal that might be more enticing for the other player while still aiming to increase my total resource count. This will be my final proposal before I can only accept or reject offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 7 X for 5 Y. This improves my holdings of X while the Y given up is acceptable. Thank you for negotiating, it was a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 7 X for 5 Y. This trade would give me 12 X and 20 Y total, which is more X than their previous offer while still reasonable for me to give up in terms of Y. Since the goal is to maximize resources, gaining more X helps achieve that.
