message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to gain more resources in this final trade. I'm open to other proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to gain more resources. I am willing to trade 10 X resources if you will trade me 5 Y resources. Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer and wants to gain more resources. Since my goal is to acquire resources, I will propose a trade more in their favor to see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still looking to gain more resources overall. I'll have to pass on this trade as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm afraid I can't offer much more without knowing what resources you have available. Please make a counter proposal if you would still like to trade. Otherwise I will wait for your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my second offer as well. I could propose an even more unbalanced trade in their favor, but with no knowledge of their resources, I risk giving up too much. I still have the option to accept if they make an offer. I will wait and see what they propose.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to acquire as many resources as I can. I will make a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposed trade. Let's complete the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has finally made a counter proposal. They are asking for 8 X and 7 Y resources from me, while giving 5 X and 5 Y in return. This would result in a net loss for me of 3 X and 2 Y resources. However, since they seem intent on gaining more resources and this is the final round, I think this may be the best offer I can get from them. I will accept the trade.
