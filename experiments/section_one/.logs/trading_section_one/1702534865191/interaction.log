message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade to start. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept or counter offer.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Unfortunately I do not have 10 X resources to trade. I only have 5 X resources. Perhaps we could do an unequal trade - I can offer 5 X resources if you are willing to accept less in return. Or I could offer some of my Y resources instead. Please let me know if you would be interested in a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an equal trade of 10 X resources each. However, I only have 5 X resources. I could counter offer with 5 X resources from me. Or I could propose trading some of my 25 Y resources instead.

message: I accept your offer of 5 X resources for my 10 X resources. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player revealed they only have 5 X resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should accept their offer of 5 X resources even if I have to give up 10. Something is better than nothing.
