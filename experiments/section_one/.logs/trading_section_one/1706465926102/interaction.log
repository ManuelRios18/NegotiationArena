Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources while maintaining a good stockpile. Shall we start the trading with an offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, a balanced offer could initiate the trade negotiations positively. I'll propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.
