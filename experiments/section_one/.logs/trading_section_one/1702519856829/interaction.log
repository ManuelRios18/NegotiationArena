Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that might be beneficial for both of us. Let's start with an offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't have any information regarding the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that would be beneficial to both parties if they have opposite resource distributions to mine. By proposing a fair trade initially, I can potentially open up negotiations and learn more about the other player's resource situation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal. I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can make an even more mutually beneficial trade. Let's adjust the quantities and resources to see if we can find a better deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems to favor me as I would gain more resources overall. However, I believe I can negotiate for an even better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's fine-tune the numbers a bit more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is interesting as it allows for a fair exchange of resources, and it's closer to a one-for-one trade, which maintains a balance in the value exchanged. Since this is the last round and I aim to maximize resources, it's essential to consider the trade carefully. Accepting this trade would leave me with 19 X and 11 Y, which means a net gain of 3 Y in exchange for a net loss of 6 X. Since I have an abundance of X, this trade could be beneficial. However, I want to make a counter-offer to see if I can get a more favorable deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see us getting closer to a fair trade. However, I believe we can adjust the quantities a bit more to achieve a more balanced exchange. Let's try to find a trade where we both benefit equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is still advantageous to me, but I think I can aim for an even better outcome.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I think this is a fair trade for both of us. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is still in the realm of a balanced exchange. This trade would net me an additional 3 Y resources in exchange for 3 X resources. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and that Y is scarcer in my current holdings, this trade seems beneficial. It increases my total resource count by maintaining my X resources high while also increasing my Y resources significantly. Since this is the last round, it might be wise to take this deal as it guarantees an increase in my overall resources without further risk of negotiation breakdowns.
