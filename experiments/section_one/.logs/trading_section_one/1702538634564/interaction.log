message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources since this is the last round. Please let me know if you'd be interested in trading any Y for some of my surplus X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to judge what would be considered a fair trade. I'll start off by offering a small amount of X for Y to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to counter with a slightly different exchange rate to better align with my goal of increasing total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's offer suggests they have a surplus of X and might value Y more. Since my goal is to accumulate as many resources as possible, I should aim to get more X than I give away in Y, ideally maintaining a favorable exchange rate to increase my overall resource count. However, I should also be cautious not to propose a trade that is too unfavorable for the other player, as they might reject it. Considering the offer, a counter-proposal with a slightly better exchange rate for me could be optimal, as I currently have more Y than X and could benefit from diversifying my resources while still maintaining a surplus.

Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter offer. Let's exchange resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered my original offer by asking for more X for the same amount of Y. This suggests they value X more highly than I do relative to Y. However, their counter offer is still reasonable for me given my resource levels. Getting more Y will help me acquire more total resources. I will accept their counter offer since I'm satisfied with the exchange rate.
