Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I hope to make a trade that is beneficial for us both. Let's start with a balanced offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me but also seems fair enough for the other player to consider. I want to increase my overall resources, but since I do not know what resources the other player has or needs, I will propose a balanced trade to initiate negotiations.
