message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sure, I can trade 5 Y resources for 5 X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have plenty of Y resources to spare, so I can afford to give some up in order to gain more X resources, which I have less of. Since more resources in general are better, this seems like a good trade for me.
