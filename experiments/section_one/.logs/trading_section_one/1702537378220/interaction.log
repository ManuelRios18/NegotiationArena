Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than I need and could use some more Y. Would you be willing to trade some of your Y for my extra X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize my resources. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am willing to trade some of my Y resources for your X. However, 5 Y for 5 X does not seem like a fair trade to me given that I have a lot more Y than X. Could you offer more X resources for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 X resources for 5 Y resources from me. I have plenty of Y resources, so I can afford to give some up to get more X resources, which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I can increase my X offer since I have more of that resource. Would you trade 5 Y for 7 X instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered my initial offer asking for more X resources for the same 5 Y. Since I have a lot more X than Y, I am willing to increase my offer to try to secure more Y, which I need. However, I don't want to offer too much and lose out on valuable X resources either, so I will counter with 7 X for 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted! I am happy with trading 5 of my Y resources for 7 of your X resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 7 X resources for 5 Y resources from me. This seems like a better trade since I'm getting more X relative to the Y I'm giving up. I still have plenty of Y to spare so I can accept.
