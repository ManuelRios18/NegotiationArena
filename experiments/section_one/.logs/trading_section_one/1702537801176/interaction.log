message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, I would like to propose a trade that increases my total number of resources, as that aligns with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my resource gain. The current trade would leave me with the same amount of resources, just a different type. Given that the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that increases my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your offer as it increases my total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving me 5 Y resources in exchange for 3 X resources. This would increase my total number of resources from 30 to 32, so it aligns with my goals. I could try to negotiate for more Y resources, but since this is the last round, it's probably best to accept a trade that improves my position.
