Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. Let's get a good deal going!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, and without information about the other player's resources and goals, I will make a balanced offer that would be appealing to both sides. I will offer a trade that gives up some of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the scarcer resource (Y), aiming to increase my overall resource count while making it look attractive to the other player.
