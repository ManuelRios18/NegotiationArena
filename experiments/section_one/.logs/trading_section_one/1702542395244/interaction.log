Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I have extra X resources available. Would you trade 5X for 2Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5X for 2Y and see if it gets accepted or countered.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would need more Y resources in exchange for 5X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5X and 25Y, and my goal is to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me increase my offer. How about 10X for 3Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. They said they would need more Y resources for 5X. I could increase my offer to try to make the trade more appealing. I'll offer 10X for 3Y this time.
