message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade to acquire more resources. Here is my offer: I give 10 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to try to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED! I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems beneficial for me as I would be getting more of a single resource than I am giving away, and since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting a trade that increases my total resource count is a good move. With this trade, I'd have a total of 15 X and 19 Y, which is more in total than my current 5 X and 25 Y.
