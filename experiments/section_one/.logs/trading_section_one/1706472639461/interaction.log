message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5X for 2Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5X for 2Y and see if it gets accepted or countered.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. At this moment, I'm looking for a trade that increases my overall resources. Would you consider a trade where I give you less Y in exchange for your X? Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round of trading, I must make a decision that maximizes my resources. The current offer of 5X for 2Y doesn't seem beneficial to me since I would end up with the same amount of X but with fewer Y resources. I need to propose a trade that would give me a net gain in resources. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll try to propose a balanced trade that might be tempting for them.

message: I accept your counteroffer. Let's trade 5X for 1Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with giving only 1Y instead of 2Y. While less Y is not ideal for me, I still gain some Y which is my scarcer resource. Since this is the last round, I should accept a trade if it benefits me at all, even if not maximally.
