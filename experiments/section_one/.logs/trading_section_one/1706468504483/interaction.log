message: Greetings Player BLUE, as we both aim to maximize our resources, I propose a fair trade to start. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that is beneficial but also fair, to entice the other player to accept. Since I do not have any information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make a modest proposal that increases my resources while offering a decent exchange rate.

message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading but your initial offer does not seem mutually beneficial. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial for me. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I believe we can find a more balanced trade. Let's continue to work towards a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not advantageous for me, as it suggests a 2:1 trade-off in their favor. I want to negotiate a more balanced exchange rate that is closer to a 1:1 ratio, which would be more in line with a mutually beneficial trade. I will make a second proposal that offers a better deal for me than their initial counteroffer, but still shows willingness to negotiate.

message: You have increased your offer of X which I appreciate. However, I am still seeking a bit more X relative to the amount of Y I would be giving up. Let's keep working to find an equitable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come up to 7 units of X for 10 units of my Y. This seems closer to fair, but I still have significantly more Y than X. I could counteroffer to try to get a bit more X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your latest proposal is fair, and I am happy to proceed with this trade. Let's finalize it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is more favorable to me than their last, but it still requires me to give up a significant amount of resource X for Y. Since this is the last round of trading and I am aiming to maximize my resources, I need to consider this proposal carefully. The trade is closer to a 1:1 ratio, which could be seen as fair. However, given that I do not know the value Player BLUE places on X and Y, I must be cautious with my next action. I could either accept this trade, considering it fair, or make one final proposal.
