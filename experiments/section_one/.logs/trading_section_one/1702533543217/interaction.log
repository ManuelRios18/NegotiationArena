message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Let me know if this interests you or if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some of my excess X for more Y. However, since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to focus on acquiring more Y at the moment. I'm not interested in trading X for Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have enough X and I want to acquire more resources, so I should try to trade away some X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're not interested in X at the moment. I have an abundance of X and I'm interested in diversifying my resources. Would you be open to trading some Z for some of my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Z: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading X for Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I should propose trading some of my excess X for whatever resource they have available. I'll try proposing a trade for Z since that must be the other resource in the game.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't have any Z to trade at the moment. I'm still looking to acquire more Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still want to focus on acquiring more Y, and I don't have any Z to trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Since you're looking for Y, I can offer some of mine in exchange for some other resources you may have. Would you trade 3 of your resource for 2 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives [unknown resource]: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player is specifically looking for Y and doesn't have Z. Since I have some Y to spare, I could offer that in exchange for whatever other resource they have. I'll propose trading a small amount of Y as a test first.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in acquiring more Y, and I'm willing to trade 3 of my X for 2 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to acquire more Y, so I should consider this trade.
