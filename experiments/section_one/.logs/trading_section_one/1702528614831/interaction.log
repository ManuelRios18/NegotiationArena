message: Hello! I would like to propose a trade to acquire more resources. What resources do you have available for trading?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible

Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 5 X for 5 Y. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 5 units of my Y. Since I have plenty of Y and acquiring more resources is my goal, this seems like a reasonable trade to accept.
