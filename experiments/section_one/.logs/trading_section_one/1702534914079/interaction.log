message: Hello, let's trade resources to mutually benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Before I can accept a trade, could you please let me know how many resources you have available so I can evaluate if the trade is fair?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give away 5 units. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has. I should try to get more information first before accepting a trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello. I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. Since you have less X, I propose the following trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has revealed they have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since I have a lot more X than them, I could offer a more unbalanced trade in my favor. However, I don't want them to reject it. I'll propose a trade where I give less X but ask for more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for sharing your resource information. I would like more X, but feel your proposed trade is unequal. As a counter offer, how about you give me 5 units of X in exchange for 5 units of my Y? That seems like a fair 1:1 ratio trade. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. They proposed trading 3 units of X for 10 units of my Y. I'm not sure this is an equal trade since I would be giving up a significant portion of my Y resources. However, I do want more X. Let me counter offer to make the trade more fair.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: A 1:1 trade is fair, but doesn't help me get more Y which I need. How about this counter offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a 1:1 ratio trade. This is fair, but doesn't help me acquire more Y which I need. I still have some proposals left, so I'll counter offer a trade more in my favor but see if they accept something slightly unequal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Trade accepted. I believe this benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED proposed trading 4 X for 7 Y. While not an exactly equal trade, this gets me more X while they get more Y that they need. I still have 18 Y left if I accept, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer at this point. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think this trade helps both of us.
