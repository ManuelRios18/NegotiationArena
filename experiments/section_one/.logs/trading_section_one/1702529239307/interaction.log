message: Hello, I have lots of X resources and would be interested in trading some for Y resources. Please let me know if you're open to trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate your offer. I'm looking to gain a larger overall number of resources. Could you offer more X in exchange for my Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered a trade that would give me more of resource X in exchange for some of my resource Y. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider if this trade helps me towards that goal. Resource Y seems to be more valuable to the other player since they are willing to trade their X for it. I could propose a counteroffer that would give me a better ratio of X to Y to maximize my total resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X. Here is a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a larger total number of resources and has countered my initial offer by asking for more X in exchange for the same amount of Y. I still have plenty of X to spare so I can afford to increase my offer. Getting 10 Y would double what I currently have. I'll propose giving them 12 X for 10 Y.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. This trade works for me, and I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has increased their offer to 12 X for 10 Y, which is a better ratio than before and would increase my total number of resources. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 17 X and 15 Y, which is an overall increase and aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, maximizing my resources now is crucial, and this trade seems beneficial.
