Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm proposing we make a trade. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering your offer. Diversifying my resources could be advantageous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and the other player is offering to trade X for Y. This would diversify my resources, which could be beneficial.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X if you're interested in trading. Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems open to trading but did not accept or propose a counteroffer. I could increase my offer of X to sweeten the deal since I have a lot of X to spare. But I don't want to offer too much without knowing what the other player has. I'll increase it slightly.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the increased offer of X, but I'm still hesitant to part with my Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is now offering more X in exchange for Y. This would give me more of the resource X, but I would still lose Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I really want to trade for some Y. This is my last offer - 10 X for 5 Y. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems reluctant to trade away their Y. I could offer even more X, but I'm getting close to my limit of proposals. I'll try one more increase to my offer to convince them.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for Y, but I'm still hesitant to part with it at this time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering a significant amount of X in exchange for Y. This would give me more X, but I would still lose Y.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've made my best offer for Y. Let me know if you reconsider or want to propose a trade yourself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to decline my offers for Y. I'm out of proposals at this point. I could keep offering more X, but without knowing what resources they have, I could overpay. Since this is the last round, I should avoid making any more weak proposals. I will wait and see if they make an offer instead.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offers, but I've decided to hold onto my Y for now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made their best offer for Y, but I still prefer to hold onto my Y for now.
