message: I propose a balanced trade to cater to our mutual interests. Looking forward to your counter-offer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to both parties without knowing the other player's resources. I will aim to propose a balanced trade based on the assumption that the other player might be seeking a diverse portfolio of resources. By offering more of a resource I have in abundance (X) and asking for less of a resource I have less of (Y), I am hoping to entice the other player into accepting the trade or proposing a counter-offer that I can consider.

message: Hello Player RED. I am appreciative of your offer, but cannot accept at this time. Perhaps we could find a deal that works better for both of us. I am open to further discussion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial if future trades involve X. However, giving away 3 units of Y may not be ideal if I need Y later.
