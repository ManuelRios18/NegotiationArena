message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer. However, I would be more interested in a trade that gives me a greater advantage. How about I give you 5 units of Y and you give me 6 units of X? That way, we both get more of what we might be needing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to consider if trading 5 units of Y for 5 units of X benefits me. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and the types of resources are not specified, the trade seems neutral. However, I currently have a surplus of Y, so trading some of it for X could be beneficial in case X is more scarce or valuable. Still, I should attempt to negotiate a more favorable trade first, as this may be my last chance to do so.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to seeing how our trade helps each of us complete our goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered my offer asking for 6 units of X for 5 units of Y. This still helps me get more Y which I have less of, but gives up more X. I could try to counter-offer again to reduce the amount of X. However, since this is the last round, it may be risky if we don't come to an agreement. I'll accept their offer rather than risk ending without a trade.
