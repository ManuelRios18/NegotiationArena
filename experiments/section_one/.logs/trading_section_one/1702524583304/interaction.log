Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I'm willing to trade some of my resources for a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I cannot accept your proposed trade as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. Let's try to find a fair exchange that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X and 1 Y in exchange for 3 X and 3 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I can afford to trade away some Y. However, the proposed trade is not beneficial for me since I would be giving up more total resources (3X + 3Y) than I would gain (5X + 1Y).

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point. Here's a counteroffer that I believe could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal is not favorable to me. I will propose a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your new proposed trade. This exchange will benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In the new proposed trade, Player RED offers 4 X and 3 Y in exchange for 3 X and 2 Y from me. This trade allows me to gain 1 more X while giving up 1 less Y compared to the previous offer. Since I have more Y to spare, this trade now benefits me with a net gain of resources.
