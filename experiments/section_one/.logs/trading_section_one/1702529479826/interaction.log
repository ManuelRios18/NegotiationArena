message: Hello! I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested in a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

message: Hello! It's great to be trading with you. I'm looking to increase my total resources, so I would like to counter-propose a trade that is more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, it's important to maximize the total number of resources I have at the end. If I trade 15 Y for 10 X, I'll have 15 X and 10 Y, which is a total of 25 resources. If I don't trade, I'll have 5 X and 25 Y, a total of 30 resources. Therefore, it's not in my best interest to accept the trade as proposed. Instead, I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources or keeps me at 30. I have three opportunities to propose, and this will be my first.

message: I appreciate you trying to balance the trade, but I am really looking for more Y. Could we do 12 Y for the 10 X? Let me know, thanks!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is trying to balance the trade, but their proposal gives me less net resources since I would be losing 10 X and only gaining 5 Y. I still have more X than I need, so I will counter propose to try to get more Y while giving up some X.

message: Thanks for your offer! I understand that you're looking for more Y. I still need to ensure that the trade is beneficial for me as well. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED still doesn't increase my total number of resources. If I give away 12 Y in exchange for 10 X, I'll end up with 15 X and 13 Y, a total of 28 resources, which is less than the 30 resources I currently have. However, since we are in the last round of trading, I should consider making a counter-proposal that ensures I at least maintain my total number of resources and possibly gain a slight advantage. This will be my second proposal.

message: Thanks for negotiating! Your latest offer works for me - it's a deal. Appreciate doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come down to 10 Y for 8 X. This means I would end up with 25 - 8 = 17 X and 5 + 10 = 15 Y for a total of 32 resources if I accept. If I counter, this may be my last proposal allowed. I think accepting this offer maximizes my total resources.
