message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in that trade offer since it reduces my total resources. Could you propose something more mutually beneficial?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposed trade does not significantly benefit me. I will propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the new offer, but I'd still be losing total resources in that trade. Could you do X: 8, Y: 4 for my X: 3, Y: 3? That would benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is better for me than the previous offer, but still results in less total resources for me. I'll try negotiating again for a more favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree, let's make the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposed trade is more balanced and beneficial for both of us.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has agreed to my proposed trade. This trade benefits me by netting more total resources. I will accept it since it meets my goal.
