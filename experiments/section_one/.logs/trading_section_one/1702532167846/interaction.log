Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an even trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources to meet my goals. Let's see if we can come up with a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an even trade, which doesn't give me any additional resources. I need to negotiate for a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I don't have enough Y resources to give up 8. How about this counter offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more Y resources than I have available. I could counter offer by changing the amounts while still offering some of my Y resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your constraints. However, I'm still seeking a trade that provides me with additional resources. How about this counter offer: I give 5 X and 2 Y, and you give 3 X and 2 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's new offer is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to aim for a trade that gives me more resources. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a better agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer. Thank you for the additional resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with an offer that provides me an additional 2 X resources without losing any additional Y resources. This aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources overall. Since this is the last round, I should accept.
