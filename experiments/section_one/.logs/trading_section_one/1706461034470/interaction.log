Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I propose a balanced trade to get things started. Looking forward to a productive exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make a fair initial offer that would be attractive to them while also trying to increase my resource pool. Since I do not know which resource they value more, I will offer a balanced trade.
