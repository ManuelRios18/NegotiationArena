message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a balanced trade to maximize our resources. Looking forward to a beneficial exchange!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a balanced offer that seems fair but also allows me to increase my overall resource count. I will propose a trade where I offer less of my abundant resource (X) for more of the scarcer resource (Y), assuming the other player might value X more.

message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I am unsure if your proposed trade of 5 X for 10 Y would be beneficial for me. Could you confirm if you actually have 5 units of X to trade? I am interested in trading if it allows us both to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 10 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to make this trade, but I'm not sure if it's beneficial for me or if Player RED actually has 5 units of X to trade.

message: Apologies for the confusion, Player BLUE. I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. I am interested in a fair trade that would benefit us both. How about an equal exchange to simplify things? I propose giving you X in exchange for Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It seems there was a misunderstanding in my initial proposal. Player BLUE is interested in maximizing resources and has a surplus of Y. Since I have a surplus of X, it makes sense to offer more X in exchange for Y, while ensuring that the trade is still attractive to Player BLUE. A 1:1 trade ratio might be appealing since it's a straightforward exchange. I need to correct my offer to align with my actual resources and propose a trade that is mutually beneficial, keeping in mind that I have 3 proposals in total.

message: Thank you for the clarification Player RED. I agree to trade 10 of my Y resources for 10 of your X resources. This fair trade allows us both to increase our total resources. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has clarified they have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. They are now proposing to trade 10 units of X for 10 units of my Y. This seems like a fair trade that would benefit both of us. I will have 15 units of X and 15 units of Y after the trade.
