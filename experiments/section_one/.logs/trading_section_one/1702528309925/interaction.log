message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm not interested in the proposed trade since it reduces my total resources. Could you offer something more beneficial to me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to negotiate a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. How about this trade instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not very beneficial to me. I will propose a new trade to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the new offer. I'm getting closer to a deal that benefits me, could you improve it a bit more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is better, but still reduces my total resources slightly. I'll try negotiating further to see if I can get an even better deal before accepting.

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
