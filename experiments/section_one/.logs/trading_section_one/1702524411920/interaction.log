Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm not interested in a trade that reduces my total resources. Could you offer something more favorable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to get more resources out of the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in a trade that reduces their total resources. I need to make a proposal that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade gives me a net gain of 8 total resources (gaining 10 X and 3 Y while giving up 5 X and 2 Y). This seems like a good deal for me.
