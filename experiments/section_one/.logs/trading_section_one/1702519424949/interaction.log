message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my Y resources and am willing to trade some of my X resources for them. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that allows for a trade that could be beneficial for both sides. I will propose giving away some of my X resources, which I have in abundance, in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. This initial proposal is meant to open negotiations and gain insight into the other player's resource situation.

Turn: 1
message: Hello, I understand your goal. I am open to considering the trade for X resources. However, I might need a bit more Y in return. Would you be willing to adjust the trade to X: 10 for Y: 3?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to increase their Y resources and is offering X in return. I can consider this trade to acquire more X resources.

Turn: 0
message: That sounds like a fair trade to me. I accept your counteroffer of X: 10 for Y: 3. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has expressed a willingness to trade but is seeking more Y resources than initially offered. Since our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and given that we have an abundance of X resources, it seems reasonable to agree to this adjustment for a favorable trade. This will leave me with 15 X and 8 Y, which seems like a decent trade-off considering the limited information I have about Player BLUE's resources.
