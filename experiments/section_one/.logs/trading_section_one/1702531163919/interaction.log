Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources to mutually benefit. Please let me know if you are interested in trading or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to give 5 X for 3 Y and see if it gets accepted or countered.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am not in need of X resources at the moment. I would be interested in trading for more Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have enough X resources but I want to acquire more Y. I can counter offer to benefit both of us.
