Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm not interested in giving up more resources than I gain. Could we discuss a trade that is more balanced?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern. Here's a counteroffer that I believe is more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not advantageous for me. I will propose a counteroffer to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the counteroffer, but I would still be losing resources in that trade. Could we find a deal where I gain more than I give up?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is still not beneficial for me. I would be giving up more resources than I would gain. I could counter with a trade that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a balanced trade. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me. I will make a final proposal to see if we can reach a more balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to future mutually beneficial trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is slightly in my favor as I would gain 1 more X resource than I give up. Since this is the last round, I should accept a beneficial trade.
