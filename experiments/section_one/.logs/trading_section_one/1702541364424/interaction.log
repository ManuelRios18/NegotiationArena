message: Hello! I am proposing an equal trade of 5X for 5Y to start. Please let me know if this interests you or propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give 3X for 7Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5Y for 5X would not be beneficial for me, as I already have 5X and I value Y more at the moment. I should propose a counteroffer.

Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving me 7Y for 3X. This seems like a good deal for me since I have a lot more X than Y. I should accept this trade to increase my total resources.
