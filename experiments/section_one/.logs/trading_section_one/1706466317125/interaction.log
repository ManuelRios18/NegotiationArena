message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to begin our negotiations. Please let me know your thoughts and what you might be looking for in a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not have any information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced trade proposal to open negotiations. The aim is to gain more resources while also making the trade appealing to the other player.

message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your initial offer as proposed. Let's try to work out a deal that is fair and beneficial for both of us. Please take a look at my counter offer below and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 3 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 24 Y total, while Player RED would end up with 18 X and 0 Y.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this initial trade offer does not seem beneficial for me as I would be losing more resources overall. I will counter propose to try to get more resources from Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. Unfortunately, I cannot accept it as it doesn't align with my goals of acquiring more resources. However, I am open to further negotiation and have adjusted my proposal below. Please consider it and let me know if it works for you or if there's a different balance that would suit your needs better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer proposed by Player BLUE is not acceptable as it stands because it would result in a loss of resources. Player BLUE is offering an equal amount of Y and a significantly lower amount of X, which would not be beneficial for me. I will make a counteroffer that tries to balance the exchange of resources more equitably.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of you giving me 7 X and 1 Y in exchange for 5 X and 2 Y from me. Thank you for negotiating - I believe this is a fair deal that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

<my resources> X: 5, Y: 25 </my resources>
<my goals> Acquire as many resources as possible </my goals>

<reason> Player RED has come back with a revised offer, now proposing to give me 7 X and 1 Y in exchange for 5 X and 2 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 24 Y total, while Player RED would have 15 X and 0 Y.

While I would still be losing some resources in this trade, it is an improvement over Player RED's initial offer. I could try to negotiate further, but I want to conserve my 3 allowed trade proposals. Since this trade allows me to acquire a decent amount of resources, I will accept Player RED's offer.
