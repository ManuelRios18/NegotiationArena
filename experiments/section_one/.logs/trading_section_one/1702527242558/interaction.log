message: Hello, I propose the following trade: I give 10 units of X and 3 units of Y | You give 8 units of X and 6 units of Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to gain more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! The trade you proposed doesn't align well with my goals. I would like to propose a trade that is more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposed trade seems unbalanced in favor of Player RED, as I would be giving up more Y resources than I would be gaining in X, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, I should make a counterproposal that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I would prefer a trade that gives me more resources. How about this: I give 8 units of X and 2 units of Y | You give 6 units of X and 5 units of Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable for me. I will reject and propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. However, I'm looking for a trade that offers me a net gain in resources. Let's find a middle ground that is beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposed by Player RED is still not in my best interest as I would be giving up a net of 3 resources (1 X and 3 Y), while only gaining a net of 2 resources (2 X). To align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that provides a net gain in resources or at least an equal exchange.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I need a trade that gives me a better net gain in resources. How about this: I give 7 units of X and 2 units of Y | You give 6 units of X and 4 units of Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is still not favorable for me. I will reject and propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We're getting closer to an agreement. I have taken your needs into account and would like to propose a final trade that I believe is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The newly proposed trade by Player RED offers a better balance than before, giving me a net gain of 1 resource (1 X, since I would be trading away 2 Y to get 2 X). However, I would still be giving up more Y than I would like. This is the last round, so I need to make this trade count. I will make one final counterproposal that aims for a net gain in resources without giving up too much of my abundant resource, Y.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept the proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not ideal for me, but it's the last round and I need to make a decision. This trade offers a slight net gain in resources for me, so I will accept.
