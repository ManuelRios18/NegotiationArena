message: Hello! I have many X resources and few Y resources. Would you like to trade some of your Y resources for my X resources? Please let me know if you would be interested in a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5X for 2Y and see what they counter with.

message: Your offer seems fair, and I'm happy to trade with you. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered 5 X for 2 Y, which seems like a balanced trade given the fact that they have stated they have many X resources and few Y resources. If I accept this trade, I will increase my total resources without knowing their exact amount of resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Considering this is the last round of trading, it is important to make a decision that maximizes my resources without further negotiation, since there won't be another opportunity to trade.
