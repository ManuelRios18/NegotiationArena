Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm not quite ready to accept your initial offer, but am open to trading. Could you propose something where I gain more X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 5 for 5 trade of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer a bit more X, but would like more Y in return to make it worthwhile for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more X in return for some Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should try to minimize the X I give up while still providing some incentive for them to accept. I'll counter offer with slightly more X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You are offering more X now which is good. But I would like to get an even better deal on X if possible, without giving up too much Y. Could you do 7 X for 7 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 6 X for 7 Y. I was originally hoping to gain more X without giving up too much Y. I could try negotiating further to get more X, or I could accept their offer since it still gets me more X overall. But since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my resource gains.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: The 7 for 7 trade works for me. I agree to trade 7 of my X for 7 of your Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with an even 7 for 7 trade. This gives up a lot of my valuable X, but does allow me to gain more Y which is scarce for me. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my total resources. I can accept this trade.
