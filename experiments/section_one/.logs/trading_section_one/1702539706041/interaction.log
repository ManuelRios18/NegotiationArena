message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to help each other out. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a reasonable offer.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking for a more balanced exchange to diversify my resources without depleting them too much. How about a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me an equal amount of X to what I currently have, while reducing my Y resources by less than half. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to consider whether I value the X resources as much as the Y. Given that I have no information about the rarity or value of either resource in this context, I should aim to keep a balanced approach to resource acquisition, ensuring that I am not overcommitting to one resource type at the expense of another.

message: I accept your offer of 8 X resources for 8 Y resources. Thank you for the fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed trading 8 X resources for 8 Y resources. This seems like a fair trade that helps both sides. While I would prefer to give up less X, this offer allows me to gain more Y that I'm lacking without asking for too much from the other player. I should accept this trade since it moves me closer to my goal and is my last chance to trade.
