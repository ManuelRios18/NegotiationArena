message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Yes, I am happy to trade 5 Y for 5 X. This benefits both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of Y resources, so trading 5 Y for 5 X seems fair. This will increase my total resources. Since this is the last round, I should accept any trade that increases my total resources.
