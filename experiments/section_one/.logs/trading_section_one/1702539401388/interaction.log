message: Hello, let's trade resources to benefit both of us in this last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Hi there! Unfortunately, I can't trade 10 units of X since I only have 5. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. How about I give you some of my Y resources for some of your X resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED does not make sense as it is an equal exchange of the same resource, resulting in no net gain for either player. Furthermore, I cannot trade 10 units of X since I only have 5. I should propose a trade that benefits me, ideally obtaining more of resource X or Y while giving away less in return. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to propose a trade that is fair and appealing to Player RED but also maximizes my resources according to the game's goals.

message: Thank you, this trade benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed giving me 10 Y resources for 5 X resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a good trade for me as I will end up with more total resources. I don't know how many Y resources the other player has available to them. I could try to negotiate for more X resources, but since this is the last round I think it's best if I accept their offer rather than risking no trade at all.
