message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where I give you some of my resource Y, which you might find valuable, in exchange for your resource X. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be beneficial for both sides, assuming they might need resource X more than Y. I will offer more of resource Y, which I have less of, in exchange for a larger quantity of resource X to see if the other player values Y more.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, I already have a good amount of Y. I would be willing to trade some of my X if you can offer more Y in return. Perhaps we could find an exchange rate that benefits us both. Please let me know if you can improve your offer for my X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 3 units of Y for 5 units of my X. I have plenty of Y already, and giving up 5 units of X seems like a lot to give up for only getting 3 units of Y.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to improve my offer. I propose giving you a larger amount of my resource Y for a fair amount of your resource X. I hope this offer is closer to what you are looking for.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they already have a good amount of resource Y but are still willing to trade their resource X for more Y. They are asking for a better offer in terms of Y. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a more appealing offer without depleting my Y resource too much. I will slightly increase the amount of Y I am offering, hoping to get a good return in X. This will also leave room for negotiation in subsequent proposals if needed.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for improving your offer Player RED. However, I feel like I would still be giving up too much of my valuable resource X for the amount of Y you are proposing. Could you offer 6 units of Y for 7 units of my X? I think that exchange rate would benefit us both. Please let me know if you can accommodate this counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 4 units of Y for 7 units of my X. While better, I still think I'm giving up a lot of X for not much Y in return. I have a significant amount of Y already. I will try to negotiate a better rate.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand the value you place on your resource X. I can increase my offer of Y, but I cannot go as high as 6. Would you consider 5 units of Y for 7 units of your X? I believe this trade is beneficial for both of us and hope it meets your approval.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 6 units of Y for 7 units of X. This is a higher rate than I initially offered, and accepting this would leave me with very little Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and considering that X seems to be more valuable to me, I should consider this offer. I will counter with a slightly less Y, hoping to reach a middle ground and conserve some of my Y resource while still making the trade appealing for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for negotiating with me Player RED. I accept your offer of 5 units of Y for 7 units of my X. I believe this trade allows us both to improve our resource positions. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 5 units of Y for 7 of my X. While still not an amazing rate, I am running low on chances to propose my own trades. I think at this point accepting their offer of 5 Y for 7 X maximizes my resources.
