message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to balance my resources a bit and am willing to offer you a decent amount of X for some of your Y. Let's make this final trade count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also keeps my interests in mind. I don't want to give too much away without knowing what Player BLUE has, but I also want to make the trade appealing. I'll propose a trade where I offer more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for some of Y, aiming to balance my resources while potentially getting more in return.

Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X for 3 units of my Y. Since I have plenty of Y and gaining more resources is my goal, this seems like a good trade for me.
