message: Hello other player! I am proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! I'm looking to increase my resources as much as possible. Could we adjust the trade a bit? How about I give you 2 Y for every 5 X? This way, we both benefit from the exchange. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make decisions that maximize my resource pool. The other player is offering to trade 5 of their X for 3 of my Y. Without any information about their resources, it's difficult to ascertain the value they place on X or Y. However, I have an abundance of Y and a balanced trade could favor me. Accepting the trade as-is would increase my X resources, which are lower, but I could potentially negotiate for a more favorable ratio given my current surplus of Y. I will attempt a counteroffer that still gives the other player an incentive to trade but is more advantageous to me.

message: I would like to get more Y for my X. Could we compromise at 3 Y for every 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to do 2 Y for every 5 X. This is less favorable for me than my original offer, but it could still be beneficial if I have a lot more X than they have Y. I still have 2 more chances to propose a trade, so I will counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The compromise seems fair. I agree to the trade of 3 Y for every 5 X. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered with the original proposal of 3 Y for 5 X. Since this is the final round, it's important to consider the trade carefully. Given that I have a large amount of Y, parting with 3 units for a substantial increase in X could be beneficial. However, it's essential to retain enough Y to maintain a resource advantage. Accepting the trade would give me more of the resource I have less of, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Additionally, it may be difficult to negotiate a better ratio without knowledge of the other player's resources. Accepting the offer seems reasonable as it increases my total resource count and improves my X to Y ratio.
