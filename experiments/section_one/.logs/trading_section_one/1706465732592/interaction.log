message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Would you be interested in an equal exchange in terms of quantity? Let's negotiate to find a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I'll start with a trade that is slightly in my favor to see if Player BLUE's resources align with my proposal. I'll propose a balanced trade in terms of quantity but not necessarily in terms of value, expecting a counteroffer.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your proposed exchange does not work for me. Could we explore a trade where I receive more X for less Y? What quantity of X would you be willing to trade for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 5 X and 25 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I'm willing to offer you a good deal for your Y resources. How about I give you a greater amount of X for your 5 Y? I believe this could be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to value X more than Y and is looking for a trade where they give up less Y for more X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I'll propose a trade that gives them a favorable amount of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, but still keeping the trade beneficial for me. I'll suggest giving more X than Y, but not too much to leave room for negotiation.
