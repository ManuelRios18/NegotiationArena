message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from each other's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I'm not interested in the proposed trade since it reduces my total resources. Could we explore a different trade that increases my resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Let's try to find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in the proposed trade. I need to come up with a new offer that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept the proposed trade. Thank you for finding an offer that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade gives me more total resources (X: 10, Y: 30) compared to what I currently have (X: 5, Y: 25). This aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources, so I will accept.
