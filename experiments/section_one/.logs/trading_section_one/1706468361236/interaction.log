Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my overall resources. Let's make a trade that can benefit us both. I propose the following exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that is fair but also benefits me by increasing my overall resource count. I will propose a trade that allows for an even exchange based on the limited information I have about the other player's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to prioritize increasing my resources. I hope we can find a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with fewer resources, which is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood, Player BLUE. Let's find a more suitable trade. How about this new proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my initial offer nor did they counter with a new proposal. This suggests that they are looking for a more favorable trade or are hesitant to reveal their resource counts. I should make another proposal that is still beneficial to me but may seem more attractive to them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, but I'm still focused on increasing my resources. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would still leave me with fewer resources overall, which doesn't align with my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. Let's try one more time to see if we can make a trade that aligns with our goals. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected my second proposal without making a counteroffer, suggesting they may be looking for a more conservative trade or may simply be trying to gauge my limits. Given that this is the last round and I have one proposal left, I must make it count. I will propose a trade that is less aggressive in the hopes of reaching an agreement or prompting the other player to finally reveal their own proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade. I believe this exchange will benefit both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the trade would leave me with fewer Y resources, acquiring 10 X resources would be beneficial to me.
