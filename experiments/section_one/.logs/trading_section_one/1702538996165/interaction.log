message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer and see how they respond.

message: Thank you for the proposal. I am happy to accept this trade as it increases my total resources, which aligns with my goal. Looking forward to our mutual benefit from this exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I do not have any information about Player RED's resources, so I am unable to make a fully informed decision. However, since this is the last round and acquiring as many resources as possible is my goal, it may be beneficial to accept a trade that gives me a balanced increase in resources. The proposed trade would leave me with X: 10 and Y: 22, which is a net gain of 2 resources. This seems like a good trade for me, as I would be increasing my total resources without a significant imbalance between X and Y.
