message: Hello! Let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thanks for the offer. I am looking to increase my total resources, and an equal trade of X for X doesn't help me accomplish that. How about we trade different resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange of resources and does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to propose a trade that is advantageous to me but also plausible enough for the other player to consider. I will propose a trade where I give less valuable Y resources in exchange for more valuable X resources, as I have more Y to spare.

Turn: 0
message: Deal! Thanks for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial even trade offer and proposed trading 10 Y for 7 X. This implies they likely have more Y than X. Since I have much more X than Y, this trade would increase my total resources. I should accept it.
