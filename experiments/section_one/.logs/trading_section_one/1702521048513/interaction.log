message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to balance my resources while maximizing the total amount. Would you be interested in a trade that helps us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I want to start with an offer that is fair but also advantageous for me. Without knowing the other player's resources, I will propose a trade that is balanced, asking for more of the resource I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2

message: Hello Player RED. I am also interested in maximizing total resources between us. However, your proposed trade of 10 X for 10 Y does not help me meet my goal. Let's try to find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of their X resources for 10 of my Y resources. This would result in me having 15 X and 15 Y, while they would have 0 X and 20 Y. 

Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this trade does not seem beneficial for me, as I would be losing 10 Y resources while only gaining 10 X. I should try to propose a trade where I gain more than I give up.

I have enough Y that I can afford to trade some away if needed. But I don't want to trade too much since more total resources is the goal.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a more favorable trade. Could you clarify what kind of ratio between X and Y would be acceptable for you? Meanwhile, let's consider this revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not satisfactory because it would leave me with the same total amount of resources but less diversified. To move the negotiation forward, I will propose a trade that offers a better ratio of X to Y, which could potentially be more beneficial for both parties.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 15 X for 8 Y. This is a win-win for both of us in terms of increasing our total resources. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade - they will give me 15 X resources if I give them 8 Y resources. This would result in me having 20 X and 17 Y, while Player RED would have 0 X and 28 Y.

This trade seems more favorable for me. I'd be gaining 15 X while only losing 8 Y, so my total resources would go up from 30 to 37. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this helps me.

The ratio of about 2 Y for every 1 X seems fair. I'd be willing to accept a similar ratio in future trades as well.
