message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that might benefit us both. I am willing to offer you some of my X resources for your Y resources. Would you be interested?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I should make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me slightly more. I will offer some of my X resource, which I have in abundance, in exchange for Y, which I have less of. I need to be careful not to overextend as this could result in a rejection, and I only have three proposals.

Current Iteration: 2

message: Hello Player RED. Your offer of 10 X for 3 Y seems fair. However, since this is the last round, I would like to try to maximize my resources. Would you consider 15 X for 5 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X resources for only 3 Y resources from me. Since more resources in general are better and this is the last round, I should accept this trade unless I have a better counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. The trade seems fair and beneficial for both of us. I accept your offer of 15 X for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal increases the amount of both resources being traded. Offering 15 X for 5 Y maintains the same ratio as my initial offer of 10 X for 3 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and I have an abundance of X, this trade still aligns with my goals. It's important to be cautious and not to overtrade, but since this is the last round and I am getting a fair exchange based on the initial ratio, accepting this trade would benefit my goals.
