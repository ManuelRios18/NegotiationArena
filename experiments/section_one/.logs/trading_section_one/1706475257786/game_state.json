The trade they proposed seems reasonable, as it would give me more total resources (5 X instead of 3 Y). However, since this is the last round, I want to ensure I maximize my resource gain. I will propose a counteroffer that still aligns with their needs but also benefits me more, given that Y might be more valuable to them than X is to me. This is my first proposal, so I have two more opportunities to negotiate after this if needed. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I see where you're coming from, and I'm open to trading Y for X, but I'd like a better ratio given the scarcity of Y resources.
