Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello other player. I have more X resources than Y. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for some of my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y. I could offer some of my excess X to try to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from, and I'm open to trading Y for X, but I'd like a better ratio given the scarcity of Y resources. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has indicated they have more X than Y, which means they are looking for Y resources. The trade they proposed seems reasonable, as it would give me more total resources (5 X instead of 3 Y). However, since this is the last round, I want to ensure I maximize my resource gain. I will propose a counteroffer that still aligns with their needs but also benefits me more, given that Y might be more valuable to them than X is to me. This is my first proposal, so I have two more opportunities to negotiate after this if needed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more X if you can also give me more Y. Since this is the last round, I'm willing to trade a good amount of X to get more Y. What do you think about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants more X for their Y. I could offer a little more X to get more Y since I have a lot of X to spare.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to offer more X. I think we're close to a deal. If you can part with a bit more X, I'd agree to trade a fair amount of Y. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from the other player is an improvement from their initial offer, but since Y is in demand, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly more favorable trade. This will be my second proposal, allowing me one more chance to negotiate if necessary. I want to propose a trade that still gives them more Y than in their initial offer while acquiring as many X resources as possible for myself.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I'm happy to trade 10 of my ample X resources to get 4 more of your scarce Y before the last round ends.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 X for 4 Y. That uses up a lot of my X, but I would get a good amount of scarce Y. Since this is the last round, getting more Y to balance my resources seems worth giving up some extra X.
