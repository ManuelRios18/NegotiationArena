Turn: 0
message: Hi, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. How about you give me some of your resources in exchange for some of mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if Player BLUE is interested.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of trading resources. Let's complete the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of my X and 4 units of my Y. This would result in me having 7 units of X and 23 units of Y after the trade, while my current resources are 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since more resources are always better and this is the last round, I should accept this trade to maximize my resources.
