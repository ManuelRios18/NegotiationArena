message: Hello! I have a lot of resource X available and would be interested in trading some of it for resource Y. Please let me know if you're open to a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of resource X and only a little of resource Y.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept your offer of 10 X for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of resource X in exchange for 5 units of my resource Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would be getting more overall resources.
