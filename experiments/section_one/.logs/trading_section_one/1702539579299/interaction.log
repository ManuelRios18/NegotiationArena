message: Hello! I am proposing we start trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing a small trade to test what resources they might have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED! Thank you for your offer. However, I'm looking for a slightly more favorable trade. How about we adjust the quantities a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is even in terms of quantity, but I have no information on the value of X versus Y or the other player's resources. To ensure I maximize my gains, I should propose a trade that favors me, given that this is the last round. However, I should be careful not to propose something too unbalanced, which the other player would likely reject. I will aim for a slightly better trade that might be acceptable to both parties.

message: I would prefer to trade equal amounts. How about Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade and countered with asking for more X resources from me. This could mean they have a decent amount of Y already. I still don't know how much X they actually have. I will counter offer to try to get more information.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your desire for an equal trade, Player RED. However, I would like to suggest a trade that provides a slight advantage for me while still keeping the balance you seek. Let's try this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player insists on trading equal amounts, which indicates they might value their X resources or are attempting to maintain a balanced exchange. However, as my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to negotiate a trade that still gives me a slight advantage. I will propose a trade that is still equal in terms of different resource types but gives me a slight numeric edge overall.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I would still prefer an equal trade. Please let me know if you can agree to:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player keeps asking for more X from me while only offering 5 Y. I'm running out of proposals to try to get more information. I will counter one more time with an equal trade. If they reject again, I may need to consider accepting their next offer if it is reasonable, since this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consistency, Player RED. As we are aiming for a mutually beneficial trade, I'll adjust my proposal slightly. Hopefully, this will meet your expectations for an equal trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED continues to propose an equal trade, which may indicate that they view the resources as being of equivalent value or are not willing to concede a trade that appears unbalanced in my favor. Since this is the last round of trading, and I have made two proposals without success, I have only one proposal opportunity left. It might be in my best interest to secure a trade now rather than risk ending without an agreement, as my goal is to increase my resource pool. I should propose a trade that might be more acceptable to Player RED but still gives me a small advantage.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I agree to trade 6 X for 6 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed an equal trade of 6 X for 6 Y. This meets my goal of trading equal amounts. I could try to negotiate further, but since this is the last round, securing some additional Y resources is likely my best option. I will accept the trade.
