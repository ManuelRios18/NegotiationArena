message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I am looking to increase my overall resources. How about we make a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is an equal exchange of the same resource, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that benefits me more than the current offer. I will propose a trade where I give less valuable resources for more valuable ones.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you, this is a good trade for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their overall resources and proposed giving me 15 Y for 10 X and 5 Y. This seems like a reasonable trade since I have a lot more X than Y. If I accept, my total resources will increase from 30 to 35. I don't know how many resources the other player has, but this benefits us both. Since this is the last round, I will accept the trade.
