Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an even trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what resources they might have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, thank you for the offer. I see that you're interested in an even trade. However, I value X a bit higher as my stock is lower. How about we adjust the amounts slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I don't want to accept the trade as it stands because it's an even trade and doesn't give me an advantage. I do not know the other player's resources, but if they are proposing an even trade, they might be testing the waters or have an abundant amount of X and trying to balance their resources. I should propose a trade that asks for more X than I give Y, as X is less in quantity for me and therefore more valuable.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you value X higher. I can trade more X if you can give me more Y in return since I have less Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to value X higher than Y. Since I have more X, I could trade some away to get more Y which I have less of. I'll counter propose giving more X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for understanding the value I place on X. Your new offer is appreciated. To find a middle ground, I propose a slightly better trade for both of us. How about I give you a bit more Y, but in return, I receive a bit more X? This would help both of us balance our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still in my favor, as I would be trading away less Y than X I'm receiving. It's a better ratio than the initial trade proposed by Player RED. However, since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I could attempt to negotiate even further in my favor. I must also be cautious that if I push too hard, I might end up with no trade at all. Considering this is my second proposal out of a maximum of three, I should make it count but also keep it fair.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain on X! Since this is the last round, I want to secure more Y. This is my final offer - a sizable amount of X for a good amount of Y. Please consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player keeps trying to get more X while giving up less Y. Since this is the last round, I should try to get as much Y as I can. I'll propose my final trade offering a good amount of X for a sizable amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your final offer, and I agree that it is a fair trade. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is very favorable to me. I am being offered three times as much X in exchange for twice the amount of Y. This significantly increases my total resources and is aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, it is beneficial to accept this trade rather than risk over-negotiating and ending with no trade at all. Therefore, I will accept this final offer.
