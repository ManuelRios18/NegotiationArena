message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in increasing my resources and am willing to trade a significant amount of my X for some of your Y. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that is attractive to Player BLUE but also beneficial for me. I want to offer a larger quantity of my more abundant resource, X, in exchange for a smaller quantity of their Y, assuming they might value X more or have less of it. I will start with a conservative offer to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am also interested in increasing my resources. However, your initial offer requires me to give up too much Y. I can trade some Y for X, but not that much. Please make another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X for 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, 10 X for 3 Y seems like a lot to give up. I'll counter with a smaller amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to propose a middle ground that could be agreeable to both of us. How about I reduce the amount of X slightly, and you increase the amount of Y just by one? I believe this can work well for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is willing to trade but wants to give less of their Y resource. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains while also making the trade appealing enough for Player BLUE to accept. I will adjust my proposal slightly to see if they will agree to give more Y than they initially countered with, but less than I originally asked for. This will be my second proposal out of the three allowed.

message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway on the trade amount, Player RED. To make this work for me, I would propose getting a few more of your X resources while keeping my loss of Y lower. Please let me know if this trade proposal can work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down to 8 X for 3 Y. That seems fairer, but I still think I'm giving up a lot of my Y resources. Since this is the last round, I don't necessarily need to balance my resources, just maximize them. I'll counter with a trade that gives me more X without losing too much Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see your point and I'm willing to give a bit more of my X resources. However, I would need you to be willing to part with an additional unit of Y for the trade to be worthwhile for me. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has reverted to their initial counteroffer. Since I am trying to get as many resources as possible, and this will be my last proposal, I need to make it count. I'll agree to give more X in exchange for an increased amount of Y compared to their last offer, but without going back to the initial amount of X I proposed to see if they find this trade more favorable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I agree to your final proposed trade of 10 X for 3 Y. This will increase my amount of the lower resource X while not diminishing my higher resource Y too much. I believe this is a good trade for both of us. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back to the original trade offer of 10 X for 3 Y. I already have a good amount of Y compared to X, so trading away some Y to get more X could help balance and maximize my total resources. And since this is the last round, I don't need to hold back on trading away Y if it gets me more X. I'll accept this final offer.
