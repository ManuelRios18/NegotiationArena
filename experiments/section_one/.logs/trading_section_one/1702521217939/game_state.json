I already have a good amount of Y compared to X, so trading away some Y to get more X could help balance and maximize my total resources. And since this is the last round, I don't need to hold back on trading away Y if it gets me more X. I'll accept this final offer. </reason>\n\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer> \n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n\n<message> Player RED, I agree to your final proposed trade of 10 X for 3 Y. This will increase my amount of the lower resource X while not diminishing my higher resource Y too much. I believe this is a good trade for both of us. Thank you for negotiating! </message>"
