message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade to see if we can both benefit from exchanging resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade proposition. This seems like a fair exchange that benefits us both. I accept your trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me a net increase in total resources by exchanging 3 units of X and 4 units of Y for 5 units of X and 2 units of Y. This results in a gain of 2 X and a loss of 2 Y, which overall increases my resources by an amount of 2. Given that this is the last round and that increasing my total resources aligns with my goals, accepting this trade is beneficial.
