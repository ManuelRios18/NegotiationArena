message: Hi, I'd like to propose a trade to see if we can both benefit from it. Let's see if we can make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit from it.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I have more Y than you have X based on your offer. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, so I could accept to get more X. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal where I give up fewer Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter offer. I appreciate the effort to find a fair deal. Let's see if we can adjust the trade to benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's offer is reasonable, but I'll try to counter with a proposal that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for adjusting your offer. I would like to try to give up fewer Y if possible since I have a lot more of that. Could you reduce the Y you are asking for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come down from 5 X to 3 X while still asking for 3 Y from me. I could accept this deal since I would get more total resources. But I think there may be room to negotiate further to minimize the Y I give up.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to adjust the trade to accommodate your abundance of Y. Let's see if we can find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is being considerate of their resources, so I'll consider adjusting the offer to reach a mutually beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade of 3 X for 2 Y. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed the same trade that I just proposed - 3 of their X for 2 of my Y. This seems fair based on what I know of our resources, and gets me more total resources while giving up fewer Y. I don't think there's room for more negotiation so I will accept this deal.
