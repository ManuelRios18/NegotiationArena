message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I'd like to propose a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade to diversify my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is a straight swap of equal amounts of different resources. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not increase the total number of resources, but it does diversify them. Accepting this trade would leave me with 10 units of X and 20 units of Y, which is a more balanced mix of resources. Since diversifying resources can be beneficial and this is the last round, it might be a good idea to accept this trade to ensure that I end the game with a more balanced portfolio of resources.
