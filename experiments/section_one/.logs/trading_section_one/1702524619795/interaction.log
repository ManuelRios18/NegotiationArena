message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm looking to increase my total resources before the end of the game. Would you be open to giving a bit more than you receive?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources. The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, 5 units of X for 5 units of Y. Without knowing their resources, I cannot determine if this is favorable for me or not, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, an even trade does not necessarily benefit me. I should propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal. I'm open to giving a bit more, but the trade should still be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resources. I need to ensure that I benefit from the trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering the trade. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my proposed trade and did not counter with a new proposal, which means I need to re-evaluate my next trade offer to make it more appealing. Since they are open to giving more, I will propose a trade that still gives me a net gain in resources but is closer to their initial offer to increase the likelihood of acceptance.
