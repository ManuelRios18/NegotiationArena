message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from each other's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I see you are interested in trading. I would like to propose a different trade that would be more advantageous for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal is an even one-for-one trade of the same quantity of resources, which doesn't inherently benefit me as my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I want to negotiate a trade that would give me a net gain in total resources. I will reject the current offer and propose a trade that gives me more X resources while giving up fewer Y resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, but I believe a more balanced trade would benefit both of us. How about Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not advantageous for me as it would deplete my X resource significantly without a proportional gain in Y. I'll propose a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade seems fair and benefits my goal of increasing my total resources. Thank you for the offer. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED gives me a net gain of 2 resources (5 X and 2 Y from RED in exchange for 5 Y from me), which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade will increase my total resources from 30 to 32, which is beneficial considering this is the last round. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
