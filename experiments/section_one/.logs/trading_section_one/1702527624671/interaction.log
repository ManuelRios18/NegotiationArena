Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start the last round of trading with a proposal. I'm looking to acquire as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but unfortunately I will have to decline at this time, as the proposed trade does not help me work towards my goal of acquiring more resources. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2 | Player RED Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X and 1 Y, while asking for 3 X and 3 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 23 Y after the trade, while Player RED would have 3 X and 4 Y. 

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me as I would be losing more resources than I gain. I should try to propose a trade where I gain more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the response. I will consider your counteroffer and make a decision soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has declined my initial proposal, and has made a counteroffer. I need to carefully consider this new offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, please take your time to consider the offer and let me know your thoughts when you can. I'm open to negotiating further towards a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED did not accept or propose a new trade. They are likely considering my previous offer and will respond soon.

My previous proposed trade was for me to give 2 X and receive 10 Y from Player RED. This allows me to gain resources, aligning with my goal.

I will wait for Player RED's response before proposing anything new or accepting a trade. Continuing negotiations seems like the best approach for now.


Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I will carefully consider the offer and get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I need to carefully evaluate the trade and make a decision.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: No problem, take your time considering the options. Let me know if you have any other questions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has responded again without accepting or proposing a counter offer. It seems they need more time to evaluate my previous proposal.

I will wait for their decision or counter proposal. Continuing negotiations is still the best approach since this is the final round of trading.


Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding. I will carefully consider the options and get back to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is being patient and open to questions. I need to make a decision and respond.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Take your time considering the options. Let me know if you have any other questions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has responded the same way again, without accepting or proposing a counteroffer. It's clear they need more time to think this over.

At this point, I have proposed one trade offer already. According to the rules, I'm allowed up to 3 proposal attempts. 

I will wait for Player RED's response before considering if I should propose something new. Rushing into another proposal without giving them time to evaluate may not be productive. Continuing negotiations still seems wise as this is the final round.
