message: Hello! I am interested in trading some of my abundant X resources for your Y resources. Please let me know if you are interested in a trade along those lines.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I am interested in trading my Y resources for your X resources. However, I'd like to propose a slightly altered trade to better reflect the value I place on my Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to maximize the total number of resources I have by the end of the trade. The proposed trade would give me 10 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y, which seems favorable because I would be increasing my total number of resources by 5. However, since I have no information about the other player's resources, I could potentially push for a slightly better trade where I give up less of my Y resources to see if the other player accepts. Since I have up to 3 proposals of my own, I can use one of them now to attempt to improve the deal.

message: Deal accepted. Thank you for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in trading Y for X, but wants less Y resources for the same amount of X. I could counter offer to try to get more Y, but since this is the last round I don't want to risk the trade falling through. I'll accept their offer even though it's not ideal for me.
