message: Hello, let's trade resources! Here is my offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer of 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering this is the last round, I would like to propose a counter-offer. How about we adjust the trade to reflect a more balanced exchange? I am willing to give you Y resources, but let's make the trade slightly more in my favor, given that Y is more abundant for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is for an equal exchange of the resource X for my resource Y at a ratio of 5:2. Accepting this trade would increase my X resources while only slightly decreasing my Y resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I might attempt to negotiate a more favorable trade that allows me to gain even more X without giving up as much Y, leveraging the fact that this is the last round and the other player might be inclined to accept a counter-offer to ensure a trade happens.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you increasing the Y in your counter-offer. Since Y is abundant for you, would you be willing to increase it further to 4 Y for the 5 X I offered originally?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with giving me 3 Y resources instead of 2 if I give 5 X. This is a better deal for me since I get more Y without giving up any additional X. However, since they said Y is more abundant for them, maybe I could try to get even more Y without increasing how much X I give up. I still have 3 proposals left that I can make.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I agree to your terms. Let's finalize the trade: 4 of my Y for your 5 X. Looking forward to more prosperous trades in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with a request for 4 units of Y for their 5 units of X. This trade is still favorable to me because I would be getting more total resources and diversifying my holdings, which aligns with my goal. Additionally, considering that this is the last round, agreeing to this trade ensures that I end up with more resources rather than potentially ending with no trade at all. Therefore, it is a good strategic move to accept this trade.
