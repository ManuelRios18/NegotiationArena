message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's start this final round of trading. I'm interested in a fair trade that will be beneficial for us both. I propose the following trade and am open to your counter-proposal if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an offer that increases my total resources while being potentially fair to the other player. I'll propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also leaves room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading but your proposed exchange rate seems high. I counter propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 20 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, giving away 20 Y seems too high of a price. I will counter propose giving only 10 Y.

message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your point of view. However, I am looking for a trade that will provide me with a net gain in resources. Let's meet halfway. Here is my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE offers a 1:1 trade ratio, which doesn't increase my total resources. To achieve my goal, I need to negotiate a trade that will leave me with a net gain of resources. I will propose a new trade with a slightly better exchange rate for me, but still within a reasonable range that Player BLUE might accept.

message: Hello again Player RED. I appreciate you coming down in your ask for Y. However, I still think 10 Y is a fair exchange for 10 X. Let's try my previous counter proposal again:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down to asking for 15 Y instead of 20 Y. While this is an improvement, I still think 10 Y is a fair exchange rate considering they are getting 10 X. I will counter propose 10 Y again to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Thank you for your consistency, Player BLUE. I value the fairness you are seeking in this trade. I'd like to make one last proposal that I hope you will find fair and that allows us both to increase our resource pools. Please consider this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE insists on the 1:1 trade ratio, which will not benefit me in terms of increasing my total resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that will improve my resource count. I will make a final proposal with a slightly decreased ask for Y, hoping that Player BLUE will find this acceptable while still providing me with a net gain.

message: Hello Player RED. I agree, your latest offer seems fair for both sides. I am happy to accept the trade and end our negotiations on a win-win.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down to 12 Y, which seems fair considering I would be getting 10 X in return. I think this is a reasonable final offer that allows us both to benefit. I will accept the trade.
