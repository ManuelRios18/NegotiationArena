message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources available for trade. Please make an offer if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of resource X and only a little of resource Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am interested in acquiring resource X. However, I value my resource Y, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer that reflects that. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 of resource X for 15 of my resource Y. Based on the current information, it's unclear whether this is a favorable trade for me without knowing how many of each resource the other player has and values. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that maximizes my total resources while being fair to the other player. I should avoid giving too much of my abundant resource Y for too little of X, as it could potentially leave me with fewer resources overall. Therefore, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more X in exchange for my Y, but still ensures that I am increasing my total number of resources.

message: Deal accepted! Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering an equal trade of 15 Y for 15 X. Since I have more X than Y, this helps balance my resources. I should accept this trade since it meets my goal of acquiring more resources overall.
