message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowing the other player's resources, my initial strategy is to propose a balanced trade that might appeal to the other player while keeping enough resources for myself. This first proposal should be a feeler to see what the other player values.

message: Hello Player RED. I have limited X compared to Y. I can accept some Y for X but your proposed trade requires me to give up too much Y. Please make a more reasonable offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 4 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to get more X. However, I don't know what resources Player RED has. I'll propose a counter offer where I give less Y.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. Considering your preference for Y, I've adjusted the trade to reflect that. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer indicates that Player BLUE values Y highly and has less of X. However, their offer is not beneficial enough for me as it stands. I should propose a trade that gives them a higher Y to X ratio, which they might consider more "reasonable" while still aiming to increase my overall resource count. This will be my second proposal, so I need to be cautious about not overcommitting resources, keeping in mind that I have only one more proposal after this.

message: Thank you for the improved offer Player RED. I accept trading 7 X and 3 Y for your 12 X and 1 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a better offer, giving me 12 X for only 3 Y. This seems fair considering I have a lot more Y. I'll accept this trade.
