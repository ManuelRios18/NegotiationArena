message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with a simple exchange and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of the other player's resources, my initial proposal should be modest but beneficial to me. I'll propose a trade where I give fewer resources than I ask for, aiming to get a better understanding of Player BLUE's stance.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Your proposed trade of 5 X for 10 Y does not seem fair to me. Could you propose something more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept losing some Y to gain more X. However, losing 10 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. The terms are acceptable. Let's proceed with this trade to benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a 1:1 trade, which is fair considering they have disclosed their resource availability. A 7 for 7 trade would still leave me with a good amount of X and increase my Y resources, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, it's better to make a trade that ensures a gain rather than risk ending with no trade at all.
