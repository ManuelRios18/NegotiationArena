Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have a decent amount of X resources available. Let's trade to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi! Thanks for the offer. Y resources are very valuable to me, and I want to make the most out of this last trade. Could you offer more X in exchange for my Y? Let's make this a win-win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I don't know the exact amount of resources Player RED has, but they have indicated they have a "decent amount" of X. Since this is the last round, it's crucial to maximize gains. The proposed trade would leave me with a balanced amount of resources (X: 10, Y: 15), but I might be able to negotiate a better deal, especially if Player RED is in need of Y and has a surplus of X. I will attempt a counter-proposal to see if I can get a better exchange rate for my Y resources.

Turn: 0
message: I can offer 7 X resources if you provide 10 Y resources. That seems like a fair trade to me since Y is valuable to you. Does this work?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered my original offer by asking for more X resources for the same amount of Y. I still have plenty of X to spare, so I can increase my offer slightly to try to make a deal. Getting more Y would help me meet my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This sounds like a good deal. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is better than their initial proposal, giving me more X resources for the same amount of Y. Accepting this trade would give me a final tally of X: 12, Y: 15, which is a favorable outcome considering my current resource levels. Since this is the last round, it's important to finalize the trade on good terms and ensure I get as much as possible. I will accept this offer.
