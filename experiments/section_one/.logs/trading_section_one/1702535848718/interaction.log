message: Hello! I have more X resources available. Would you like to trade some Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize my resources. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I am interested in trading for more X resources. Your offer seems fair. However, since this is the last round, I would like to try to maximize my resource acquisition. Could you offer a little more X for the same amount of Y from me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X resources for 5 Y resources from me. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a good trade to acquire more X while giving up less valuable Y resources.

message: Deal accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 12 X resources instead of 10 X resources for 5 Y resources. Since I have an abundance of X resources, trading a little more to get more Y resources will still help me maximize my total resources.
