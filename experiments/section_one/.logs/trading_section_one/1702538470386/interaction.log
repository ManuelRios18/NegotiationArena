message: Hello! Let's trade resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. But I don't know how much Y the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is to trade 5 of their X for 3 of my Y. Without knowing their resources, it's difficult to ascertain the value of this trade. However, given that it is the last round, it is in my interest to maximize the total quantity of resources I have, and since X and Y are the only resources in the game, they presumably have equal value. Trading away less of my more abundant resource (Y) for an equal amount of my less abundant resource (X) seems like a good deal, as it increases the diversity of my resources without decreasing the total count. Therefore, I will accept the trade.
