message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in general. I'd like to propose a new trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X but reduce my Y, which goes against my goal of acquiring more resources in general. I should propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thanks for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and proposed getting 3 X in exchange for giving me 8 Y. This seems like a good deal for me since I have a lot more X than Y. I should accept this trade to increase my total resources.
