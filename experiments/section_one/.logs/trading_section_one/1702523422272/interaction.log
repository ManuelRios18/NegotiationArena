message: Deal accepted. Thanks for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 1 unit of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 4 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I can afford to trade away some Y to get more X.
