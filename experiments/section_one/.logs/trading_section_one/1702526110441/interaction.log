Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello there, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that increases my total resource count. How about a counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED is giving me equal amounts of X resources while costing me Y resources. This trade does not increase my overall resource count. However, since this is the last round of trading, I am inclined to make a counter-offer that would increase my total resources, even if slightly. I will propose a trade where the exchange rate is more favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal. How about this trade instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a trade that increases their total resource count. I need to consider this while proposing a new trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade looks good to me. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is advantageous for me, as I would be receiving more X resources than I give away in Y resources. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count by 1, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, this small gain is still a gain, and there is no benefit in holding out for a potentially better trade that may not come.
