message: Hello! I have more X resources than Y resources. Let's trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give some away to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello. I am interested in trading but your proposed exchange rate of Y to X is not favorable for me. Let's negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X resources in exchange for 15 Y resources from me. Since I have more Y resources, I can afford this trade. More X resources aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain! Let's compromise on the exchange rate - how about my X: 12 for your Y: 12?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a less favorable exchange rate for me. I still have more X than I need, so I can afford to compromise a bit. I'll propose meeting in the middle on the exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your compromise proposal. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise trade of 12 X resources for 12 Y resources. This exchange rate is more favorable for me than the original proposal. I have enough Y resources to make this trade while acquiring more valuable X resources. As this is the last round, I should accept a favorable trade while I can.
