message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer. I'm interested in acquiring more of resource X, but I would like to propose a slightly different exchange. How about I give you less of Y, since I value it as well? Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is to give 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since I have an abundance of Y and the trade would increase my total number of resources by 2, it seems like a beneficial trade. However, because this is the last round, it's important to maximize the benefit. It might be possible to negotiate a more advantageous trade where I give away less Y for the same amount of X, increasing my net gain. I'll propose a counteroffer that is still attractive to Player RED but more beneficial to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your point about valuing resource Y. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player values resource Y as well, so I need to consider that in the trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade, I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has accepted my counteroffer, which is favorable as it increases my total resources by 3 units (5 units of X in exchange for only 2 units of Y). Since this is the last round, accepting this trade will ensure that I end the game with more resources than I currently have without the risk of a less favorable counter-proposal.
