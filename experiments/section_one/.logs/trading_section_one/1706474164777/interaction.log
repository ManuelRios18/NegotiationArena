message: Hello, let's have a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I would like to gain more resources in this trade. Could you offer more X without asking for too much in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an equal trade of 5 units of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to gain more X without giving up too much of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can give you more X if you can offer more Y in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more X without offering much Y in return. Since I have a lot more X than Y, I could afford to give them more X if they give me more Y. I'll propose a trade where I give them 10 X for 5 Y.

Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 10 units of X if I give 5 units of Y. I still have 20 units of Y left if I make this trade, and I would gain 5 additional units of X which helps me acquire more resources overall. This seems like a good deal to accept.
