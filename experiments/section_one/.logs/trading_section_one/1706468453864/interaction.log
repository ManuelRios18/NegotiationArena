message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Shall we make a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make an initial offer that seems fair and beneficial to me without knowing the other player's resources. I'll propose a balanced trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) for their resource (Y), assuming they might have a different abundance.

message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading some of my ample supply of Y for your X to diversify my holdings. However, your offer of 10 X for 10 Y does not benefit me enough in the final round. Could you offer more X to make it more fair? I have more Y than I need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have more Y than X, so trading some Y for X could help diversify my resources. However, since this is the last round, having more total resources is most important. I'll counter by asking for more X.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking for a fair trade. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to meet in the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they have an ample supply of Y, which means they likely have more Y than my current amount. They've asked for a better ratio, proposing 15 X for 10 Y. This is a better ratio for me in terms of total resources gained since I would be getting twice as much Y compared to giving away X, considering my initial abundance of X. However, I want to propose a slightly better trade for myself, aiming to give up less X while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.

message: That trade offer is agreeable to me. By trading some of my ample Y resources for more of your X, we both end up better positioned in this final round. Thank you for negotiating in good faith!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 12 X for 10 Y. That gets me closer to my goal of acquiring more total resources, since I will end up with more X which I have less of. I could try to negotiate further, but 12 X is a good amount and since this is the last round, I should accept a beneficial trade while I can.
