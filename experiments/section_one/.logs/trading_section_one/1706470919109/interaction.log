Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your resources for mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start the trade by proposing a fair offer to see if we can benefit each other.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, thank you for the offer. However, I'm looking to increase my total resources, so I can't accept a trade that results in a net loss for me. Let's find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal from Player RED is not favorable because it results in a net loss of resources. They offer 5 units of X and 2 units of Y for my 3 units of X and 6 units of Y. This means I would only gain 2 units of X and lose 4 units of Y overall. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a counteroffer that results in a net gain or at least an equal trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal to increase your total resources. Let's work towards a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants a more balanced trade, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer, but I'm still looking for a trade that increases my total resources. Let's adjust the numbers slightly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposal from Player RED is an improvement over their last offer but still results in a net loss of resources. They offer 7 units of X and 3 units of Y for my 4 units of X and 7 units of Y. This means I would gain 3 units of X while losing 4 units of Y overall. Since Y seems to be less valuable to Player RED, I should attempt to negotiate a trade where I give up fewer units of Y for a gain in X, ensuring I come out with a net gain or maintain an equal balance. I have one more opportunity to propose a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see that you want to increase your total resources. Let's try this trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still aiming to increase their total resources, so I need to make a counteroffer that is more beneficial for both of us.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks again for the offer. We're almost there, but I'm still looking to increase my total resource count. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not beneficial as it would result in a net loss of resources. They propose giving 6 units of X and 4 units of Y for my 3 units of X and 6 units of Y. I would gain 3 units of X but lose 2 units of Y. I want to ensure that any trade results in a net gain of resources. This is my last chance to propose a trade, so I need to make it count and propose a trade that would benefit me more clearly.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal to increase your total resources, but I need to ensure that the trade is fair for me as well. Let's see if we can find a balance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still focused on increasing their total resources. I need to consider if this trade is beneficial for me as well.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand we both want a fair trade. As I've reached my limit for proposals, I'll wait for your next offer and will consider it carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the other player has not proposed a new trade, and I have reached my limit of three proposals, my only options now are to accept a trade or to do nothing and wait to see if they make another offer that I can accept. Since they have proposed no new trade this turn, I must either accept a previous trade or propose nothing. Given that none of the previous trades have been beneficial to me, I will not accept them.
