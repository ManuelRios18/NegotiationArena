Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make the most of this final round. I propose a balanced trade to benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that seems fair and enticing to the other player without knowing their resources. I will start with a balanced offer that I can afford to improve upon in subsequent proposals if necessary, keeping in mind that I have a maximum of 3 proposals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources. I believe there might be a more beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not ideal for me as I want to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a more advantageous trade. Let's try another approach. Please let me know if this is more to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept the initial offer and did not propose a counteroffer, which means I should propose a new trade that is more appealing yet still beneficial for me. Since I am aiming to maximize my resources, I will make an offer that gives away some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for more of the scarce resource (Y), which they might be willing to trade in larger quantities.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort, but I'm still looking to acquire a larger amount of resources. Perhaps a different trade could be more beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is more balanced, but I still aim to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a significant gain. Here's my final offer, which I believe is generous and should meet your goal of acquiring a larger amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has indicated a second time that they're looking to acquire a larger amount of resources. Since they haven't made a counteroffer, it's challenging to gauge what they're looking for. I will make my third and final proposal, offering a more generous trade in hopes of reaching an agreement, but I need to be careful not to overextend, as I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the final offer. I find it to be generous and suitable for my goal of acquiring a larger amount of resources. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is more in line with my goal of acquiring more resources.
