message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade in this final round. Let's make an offer that can work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be beneficial for both parties, assuming they might have a similar amount of resources. My strategy is to propose a trade that seems fair but slightly in my favor to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The proposed trade is not balanced in terms of resources. I believe we can come up with a more mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems to be in favor of the other player. I need to negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain a balance in my resources while still increasing the total count. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not favorable to me, as I would be giving up all of my Y resources and not receiving a proportionally larger amount of X resources in return. I aim to increase my total resource count, so I need to counter with a proposal that allows me to gain more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for balance, but I believe we can still make a trade that benefits both of us more. How about this trade proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 11, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposed trade still doesn't provide me with a significant increase in resources. I need to propose a more favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the updated proposal, Player BLUE. Let's adjust the amounts slightly to ensure we both end up with a net gain in resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal by Player BLUE is an improvement over the previous one, as it offers a better balance of resources. However, the trade is still not in my favor because I would be giving up more Y than I am receiving. I have to make a final counter-proposal that maximizes my resource gain while considering Player BLUE's willingness to trade more Y resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I think we can still improve the trade to ensure a better net gain for both of us. How about this adjusted proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal still doesn't provide me with a significant increase in resources. I need to propose a more favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, this trade looks good to me. I accept your proposal. It's been a pleasure to negotiate with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is more favorable than their previous offers. By accepting this trade, I would be giving up 8 units of X and 3 units of Y but gaining 10 units of X and 7 units of Y. This results in a net gain of 2 units of X and 4 units of Y, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round and it appears to be the best possible trade, I should accept this offer.
