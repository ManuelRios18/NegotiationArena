message: Hello! Let's try to make a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to get as many resources as I can. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to propose a trade that benefits me as well. How about this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial to me as it requires me to give up Y for only X. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal! I accept trading 8 X for 10 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is trying to get more Y from me while giving up less X. I still think my original proposal was fairer. I could counter offer by asking for more X, but since this is the last round I don't want to risk the other player walking away. I will accept their offer and trade 8 X for 10 Y.
