message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we each trade 5 units of our respective resources. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your initial proposed trade of 5 resources each, as that would not help me meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I have a counter proposal that I think you may find agreeable. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing that we each trade 5 of our resources. Since I have more Y resources, trading equal amounts is not ideal for me. I will counter by proposing that Player RED gives me 10 X resources while I only give 5 Y resources. This allows me to gain more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I appreciate your counteroffer, but trading 10 X for 5 Y favors you more than me. However, I am still interested in trading for some of your Y. Would you accept a trade of 8 X for 5 Y instead? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for 10 of my X resources in exchange for only 5 of their Y resources. This trade favors them more than me. However, I don't know exactly how many resources they have. I could try negotiating by proposing a trade more in my favor, but I don't want to risk them walking away entirely. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and Y is more scarce for me, I think it's best if I counter offer to trade 8 X for 5 Y.

message: Hello Player RED. I accept your counter proposal of 8 X for 5 Y. I believe this allows us both to gain resources we value. Thank you for negotiating, it was a pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with an offer of 8 X for 5 Y. This is still in my favor as I value Y less than X, so I will accept this trade.
