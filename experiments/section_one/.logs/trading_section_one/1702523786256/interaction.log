message: That trade works for me. Thanks for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.
