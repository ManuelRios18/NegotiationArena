message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start with an offer where we can balance our resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a balanced offer that would seem fair and appealing to Player BLUE, without knowing their resource status. I will offer a trade that gives me a slight advantage in terms of quantity, assuming that Player BLUE might value one resource over the other.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, I don't think the proposed trade allows me to meet my goal of acquiring more resources. Let's keep discussing to find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 3 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 24 Y total while Player RED would have 18 X and 0 Y. 

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial for me as I would be losing more resources than I gain. I should try to propose a trade where I gain more resources.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I see your point and would like to make another offer. Let's find a trade that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not favorable, as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I would be giving up more than I receive. Therefore, I'll make a counter-proposal that is more balanced and aims to increase my total resources. I have to ensure that the trade is appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider, while still advancing towards my goal.

message: Hello Player RED. I accept your proposed trade as it allows me to gain more resources overall. Thank you for negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In Player RED's new offer, they propose to give me 10 X and 1 Y in exchange for 5 X and 4 Y from me. This trade would result in me having 10 X and 22 Y total, while Player RED would have 15 X and 0 Y.

This trade is more beneficial for me as I would gain more resources than I lose. I should accept this offer.
