Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in making a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I see your offer. I'm interested in a trade, but I would like to propose a slight adjustment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is offering an equal amount of resource X for a lesser amount of resource Y. This could be beneficial as it keeps the resources balanced and increases the total number of resources. However, since this is the last round, it may be advantageous to propose a counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal, considering I have the leverage of more Y resources. I need to be cautious with my proposals since I have a limit of three, and this trade might be close to what I'd consider acceptable.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the adjustment. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade with a slight adjustment. Let's consider the offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to hear you're interested in negotiating further. Here's another proposal, let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not proposed a new trade nor have they accepted my counterproposal. With no new information or counteroffer to consider, it is challenging to gauge what they find acceptable. I could either choose to wait for them to propose a new trade or I can make another proposal. Given that I have two proposals left and this is the final round, I may want to make another proposal that's slightly more in their favor than my last one, yet still beneficial for me, to try to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm evaluating the proposal. I'll get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made another proposal. I need to consider if this offer aligns with my goal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Take your time. I'm here when you're ready to respond to the proposal or if you have another trade in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is still evaluating the proposal and has not made a counteroffer, it's best to wait for their response before making any further moves. I should not use up my remaining proposal opportunity hastily. I have one proposal left, and it would be prudent to save it until I have more information on their position.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've decided to accept your last proposal. Let's make the trade.
player answer: Player RED ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is waiting for my response. I need to make a decision.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to the trade.
player answer: Player BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has accepted my last trade proposal, which is beneficial to me as it increases my total resource count. Since this is the final round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade is in line with my objectives.
