message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing an equal trade since I do not know what resources you have. Please let me know if you would like to change the offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate the straightforward offer, but I'm looking to maximize my resources. Let's adjust the quantities a bit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange of resources, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a counter-proposal that benefits me without being too unfair, which might entice Player RED to accept. I will propose a trade where I give up less Y in exchange for their X, since I have a surplus of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I can give you the 5 Y resources you requested but would like 7 X resources in return. Please let me know if this works for you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE rejected my initial equal trade offer and proposed getting more Y resources from me. Since I don't know their resource levels, I could try countering to get more X resources from them while still giving them the Y resources they want.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. However, I can't trade 7 X as I only have 5 X in total. Let's find a middle ground. How about this counter-offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is asking for more X resources than I currently have, which makes the proposed trade impossible for me to accept. I need to counter with a proposal that I can fulfill and that also moves towards my goal of acquiring more resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player RED a favorable amount of Y for the amount of X they are offering, hoping they might find it acceptable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for letting me know about your resource levels Player BLUE. Getting more Y would be good for me. Could you do 4 X and 6 Y for my 3 X and 3 Y? If not, I can accept your previous offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE revealed they only have 5 X resources total. Their new offer gives me more Y resources but less X. Since I have more X than them, getting Y is likely more beneficial. I could accept or try one more counter offer to get a bit more X if possible.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my situation, Player RED. I am happy to hear you would accept my previous offer. Let's proceed with that trade then.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has suggested a trade that would result in a net loss for me, as I would be giving up more resources than I would be receiving. Since Player RED has also mentioned they could accept my previous offer, it would be in my best interest to accept that previous trade to ensure a net gain of resources. This would fulfill my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible in the final round of trading.
