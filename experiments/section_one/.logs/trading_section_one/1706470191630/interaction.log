message: Hello, let's start the final round of trading. I propose the following trade: I give 10 X and 3 Y | You give 8 X and 6 Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, I don't think trading away some of my scarce resource X is worthwhile for me at the moment. Perhaps we could consider an alternative trade that is mutually beneficial. What are your thoughts?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 3 Y in exchange for 8 X and 6 Y from me. This means I would gain 2 more X but lose 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, I think losing 3 Y is not worth gaining only 2 X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern about trading X. How about this: I propose to give 5 Y in exchange for 6 X. This way, you get more Y while I get some additional X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is hesitant to trade X, so I need to come up with a new proposal that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. I am happy to exchange 6 of my abundant resource X to gain 5 of my scarcer resource Y. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade - they will give me 5 Y in exchange for 6 X from me. This means I would lose 1 X but gain 5 Y. Since I have a lot more Y than X, gaining 5 additional Y is likely more valuable to me than losing 1 X.
