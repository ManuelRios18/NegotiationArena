message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to balance our resources while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I want to start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly, hoping to get a counter-offer to gauge what the other player values. I'll propose giving less of the resource I have more of (X) and ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y), aiming to increase my overall resource count.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate you trying to make a fair trade, giving up 10 of my Y for only 5 X does not help me meet my goal of acquiring more resources. Let's try to find a deal that benefits both of us more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, giving away 10 Y for only 5 X does not seem like a good deal for me.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. However, I am aiming for a fair exchange that benefits us both equally. How about a one-to-one trade to keep things balanced?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not favorable for me as I would be giving up twice as much of one resource to receive an equal amount of another, leading to a net loss of resources. I will counter with a proposal that is more balanced, offering a 1:1 trade ratio which still increases my total number of resources and maintains a fair exchange.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 7 X for 7 Y. This will benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 7 X for 7 Y. This seems like a fairer trade than before. While it still results in me losing some Y, I would be gaining more X which gets me closer to my goal of acquiring more total resources.
