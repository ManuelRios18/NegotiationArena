message: Hello, I am proposing we start trading some resources. I hope we can make some good deals!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing a small trade to test what resources they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I think we can come to a beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a slightly different trade that would help me reach my goal of increasing my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that I want to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize the number of resources I gain from this trade. Since both resources are equally valuable to me, and the trade offered is an even one-for-one trade, accepting it wouldn't increase my total number of resources. However, rejecting the offer without a counteroffer would not be beneficial either. Therefore, I should propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to see if the other player accepts. I'll propose giving fewer of my Y resources for the same amount of their X resources.

Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I look forward to future trading opportunities.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed giving 4 Y instead of 5 Y. This means they likely have less Y than me. I could counter offer to try to get more Y, but since my goal is to maximize total resources, I will accept their offer.
