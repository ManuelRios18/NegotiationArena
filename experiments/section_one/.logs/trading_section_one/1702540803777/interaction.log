message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in trading 5 of my Y for 5 of your X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X, so I don't want to trade for more X. I want to keep as much Y as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. How about you give me 8 Y for 5 X instead? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer. I still don't know anything about their resources. I will try proposing a trade again but adjust the ratio to be more in my favor in case they value Y more than X.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected my trade offers so far. I still don't have information about their resources but they seem to value their Y resources more. I have 2 trade proposals left. I will try adjusting the ratio even more in my favor to see if they will accept.
