Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I would like to propose a trade. How about I give you 10 units of resource X in exchange for 8 units of resource Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me to accept since I will gain more resources overall.
