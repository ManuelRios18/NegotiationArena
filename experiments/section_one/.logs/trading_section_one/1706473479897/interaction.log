message: Hello, let's trade resources. I have more X than Y. Please make an offer and we can negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see that you have more X than Y, and I'm willing to trade my Y for your X. However, I'd like to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more X than Y, so I should try to acquire more X by trading my Y.

Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, let me know what trade you would like to propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems open to trading Y for X, but wants to propose their own trade first. I'll wait to see what they offer before making another proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'd like to propose the following trade: I give 10 Y in exchange for 5 X. This way, I can balance my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 Y for only 5 X. This is very beneficial for me since I have a lot more X than Y. I should accept this trade.
