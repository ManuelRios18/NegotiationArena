message: Hello! Since this is our last chance to trade, I'd like for both of us to benefit. Would you trade 5 of my X resources for 2 of your Y resources? Let me know if you'd like to negotiate a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X resources for 2 Y resources and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'll have to consider it carefully. I'll get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X resources and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I need to carefully consider this offer to ensure I benefit from the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time to think it over. Let me know if you have a counterproposal or would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counteroffer. This likely means they need more time to consider the offer and their own resource situation. I will wait for their counterproposal before making any changes to my offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering my options and will get back to you soon with a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still considering the initial offer and has not provided a counterproposal. I will wait again for their response before changing my offer. Since this is the last round, I do not want to use up my 3 chances to propose trades unless necessary.
