message: Hello, I propose the following trade: I give 10 units of X and 3 units of Y | You give 6 units of X and 4 units of Y
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 6 units of X and 4 units of Y from me. This would result in me having 9 more units of X (10 from them - 6 to them) and 1 less unit of Y (3 from them - 4 to them). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, gaining 9 more X is better than losing 1 Y.
