message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade where I give you a substantial amount of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for a smaller amount of your resource Y. Let's start with a fair trade and adjust as needed. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I do not know the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that seems fair without any additional information. I'll propose giving less of resource Y since I have less of it and more of resource X since I have it in abundance. The goal is to make an attractive offer to the other player, hoping that they might be in need of resource X more than Y.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposed trade as it allows me to gain more total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of resource X in exchange for 3 units of my resource Y. I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me as I would gain more resources overall.
