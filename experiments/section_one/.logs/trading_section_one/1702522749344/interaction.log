message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking to trade resources in a way that benefits us both. Would you be interested in the following offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair but also slightly favors me. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will make an initial offer that is balanced, showing that I am willing to trade but also opening the door for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your offer but giving up 15 Y for only 10 X does not seem like a fair trade for me. Perhaps we could find a deal that benefits us both more evenly. What do you think about 5 X for 10 Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I would be giving up more total resources than I would gain.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see your point, but I believe a 1:2 trade ratio doesn't reflect the value I place on my X resources. How about we try a more equal trade? Perhaps 7 X for 10 Y? This way, the trade is more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my best interest as I would be giving up X, which I have more of, for less Y. However, I can counter with a proposal that's more balanced while still trying to maintain an advantageous position. I must remember I have a limited number of proposals, so it's important to make this one count.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposed trade of 7 X for 10 Y. I agree this is a fair ratio for both of us and helps balance my resource distribution. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with 7 X for 10 Y. This is a more fair ratio but I would still be giving up more total resources than gaining. However, since this is the last round, balancing my resources could be more valuable than maximizing total resources. I'll accept the trade since it helps balance me.
