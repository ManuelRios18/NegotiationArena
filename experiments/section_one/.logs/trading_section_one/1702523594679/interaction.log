message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer some of my resources in exchange for more resources. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer but I think we may be able to find a more mutually beneficial trade. Since this is the last round, I'm hoping to acquire as many total resources as possible. Please let me know if you'd be open to a different proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 5 units of X and 1 unit of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to get more X while giving up some Y that I have a lot of. However, since more resources in general are always better and this is the last round, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal before accepting.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I see that you value Y more than X, and I value X more than Y. I am open to finding a trade that benefits us both. I will consider your proposal and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to acquire as many total resources as possible, so I need to consider this in my response.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You make a good point - it seems we value different resources higher based on what we currently have. I'm happy to wait for your counterproposal for a trade that works for both of us. Just let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED said they value X more than Y, while I value Y more than X. So there is an opportunity here for a mutually beneficial trade. However, Player RED did not propose a counteroffer this round. I could propose another trade, but I think I will wait and see if they come back with a new offer before using up another one of my 3 trade proposals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience. I have considered our resources and I propose the following trade: I will give X: 7, Y: 2 in exchange for X: 4, Y: 6. I believe this trade could benefit us both based on our resource preferences.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to wait for my counterproposal, so I need to come up with a trade that benefits us both.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer Player RED. I accept the proposed trade - it will allow us both to gain more of the resource we value higher. Pleasure trading with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed giving 7 X and 2 Y in exchange for 4 X and 6 Y from me. This would result in me having 8 X and 19 Y total after the trade. Since more total resources is best and this trade allows me to gain more X while giving up some excess Y, I think this is a good deal to accept.
