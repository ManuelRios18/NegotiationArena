message: Hello! Since this is the last round, let's try to make a fair trade that benefits us both. I can offer some of my X and Y resources. What do you have available to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an equal trade to assess what they have.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to increase my total resources. I have a good amount of Y and am willing to trade more of it for your X. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange, which neither benefits nor harms either player in terms of resource quantity. Since our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round, we should aim to negotiate a trade that increases our total resources. We can propose a trade that is slightly in our favor, given that we have a surplus of Y and may be able to leverage that. We should also consider that this is our first proposal out of a maximum of three, so we have room to negotiate.

message: Trade accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems to have a good amount of Y resources and is willing to trade more Y for my X. Although their proposal gives me less total resources, it allows me to gain more of the rarer Y resource that I have less of. I should accept this trade.
