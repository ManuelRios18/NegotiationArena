message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your resources for mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, your offer seems a bit steep for me. I would be willing to part with some Y, but not 10 units. Let me know if you would accept less Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, giving away 10 Y seems too high of a price. I will counter offer with a smaller amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would be open to a trade involving less Y. Let's find a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to trade Y for X, but at a lower amount than initially proposed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer. I accept trading my 5 units of Y for your 8 units of X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 8 units of X while still asking for 5 units of my Y. This seems like a good deal for me since I would be getting more X without having to give up much Y. I will accept this offer.
