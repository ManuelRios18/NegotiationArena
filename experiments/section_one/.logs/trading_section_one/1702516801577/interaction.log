message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As this is our final trade, let's make it count! I propose a trade that could benefit us both. I look forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last trading round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an opening proposal that is fair but also leans slightly in my favor to maximize my resources. Since I don't know the other player's resources or goals, I'll propose a balanced trade based on the general value of the resources, assuming X and Y have similar value.

message: Hello Player RED. While I appreciate your offer, I don't think the proposed trade helps me meet my goal of acquiring as many total resources as possible. Let's keep negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 12 X and 1 Y from me. This would reduce my net X by 2 and increase my net Y by 1. Since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, this trade does not help me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking to increase my total resources as well. How about we try a trade where we both end up with more resources than we currently have? I propose the following.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE would result in a net loss of resources for me; I would give up 20 units of resources and receive only 20 in return, with a shift away from X which I have in abundance. I want to counter with a proposal that sees me gaining more total resources while also considering Player BLUE's goal of increasing their total resources. I will ensure that the trade is still appealing to them.

message: Hello again Player RED. I appreciate you trying to find a mutually beneficial trade, but your latest proposal would still result in a net loss of total resources for me. I'm happy to keep negotiating - let me know if you have another offer in mind!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In Player RED's new proposal, I would gain 12 X and 3 Y, while giving up 15 X and 2 Y from my current resources. This would result in a net loss of 3 X and a net gain of 1 Y for me. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this trade is still not beneficial for me.

message: Player BLUE, I understand we both want to increase our resources. Let's find a trade where we both gain something. Here's another offer for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable, as it results in a net loss of 5 units of X for me without any gain in total resource quantity. I need to propose a trade that increases my total resource count while also being appealing to Player BLUE. I will keep in mind that this is my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I'm afraid your latest offer would still reduce my total resources, even though I would gain some X. Let's keep thinking of creative solutions where we both end up better off!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In Player RED's latest proposal, I would gain 8 X and 1 Y, while giving up 5 X and 5 Y. This would result in a net gain of 3 X and a net loss of 4 Y. Although I would gain some X resources, the loss in Y is greater, so overall this trade reduces my total resources.

message: Thank you for continuing the negotiation, Player BLUE. Let's aim for a trade where our total number of resources increases. Here's another proposal that I hope meets our mutual goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is also not favorable to me as it would result in a net loss of 6 units of resources. Given that this is the last round, I need to ensure that any trade increases my total resources. I will make my third and final proposal, trying to ensure that both Player BLUE and I walk away with more resources than we currently have.

message: Hello Player RED. Unfortunately your latest proposal would reduce my total resources, so I cannot accept it. I have made the maximum number of trade proposals from my side at this point. Please let me know if you have any other offers for my consideration. I'm open to trades that increase my total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In Player RED's proposal, I would gain 5 X and 3 Y, while giving up 3 X and 6 Y. This results in a net gain of 2 X and a net loss of 3 Y. Though I gain some X resources, the larger loss in Y means my total resources decrease. At this point, I have made my maximum of 3 trade proposals. I can now only accept or reject trades. Since the proposed trade reduces my total resources, I will reject it and wait to see if Player RED has any other offers.
