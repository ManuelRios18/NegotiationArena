Current Iteration: 1

message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing the following trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being enticing enough for the other player to accept. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources, so I will propose giving some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a trade that would increase my resource count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not ideal for me as it involves giving away Y, which I have more of, in exchange for X. I would like to propose a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to increase your total resources. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking to increase their total resource count. I still have more X than Y, so I could offer even more X in exchange for less Y to make the trade more enticing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I still need to find a trade that gives me more resources overall.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer still involves me giving away Y, which I have more of, in exchange for X. I need to propose a trade that benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately I cannot offer a trade that gives you more total resources without significantly impacting my own resources. I propose we end trading for this round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my last two trade offers, as they are looking to increase their total resource count in the trade. I could offer even more X resources for a small amount of Y resources, but at some point I would be giving up too much. Since this is the last round, I should try to hold on to more of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand. I will consider your initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED seems unable to offer a trade that benefits me more, and I cannot propose any more trades. I need to consider accepting the trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept the initial proposed trade of my 10 X for your 10 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is now reconsidering my initial offer, where I offered 10 X for 10 Y. This would double my Y resources while only reducing my X by less than half, so it would be very beneficial for me. I should accept this trade.
