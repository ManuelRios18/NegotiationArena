Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose the following trade. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round, I should make an enticing trade proposal to the other player that benefits me but also appears fair enough for the other player to consider. I'll propose a balanced trade, slightly in my favor, to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm afraid the trade is not favorable for me. I propose a counteroffer to balance the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is unbalanced as I would be giving away more resources than I would receive.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate the adjustment. How about we meet halfway from your offer? Here's a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is a better ratio of X to Y for me than my initial offer. However, I might still push for a slightly better deal, considering this is the last round of trading. I'll make another proposal that's a compromise between their offer and my original one. This is my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment, but I'm still aiming to acquire more resources. I propose a new trade to better align with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more balanced, but I still need to ensure that I receive enough resources to meet my goals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer seems fair, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is very close to my last proposal, and since this is the final round, I should consider accepting a trade that is favorable rather than risk ending with no trade at all. The offered ratio is still in my favor, and accepting this offer would allow me to achieve my goal of acquiring more resources.
