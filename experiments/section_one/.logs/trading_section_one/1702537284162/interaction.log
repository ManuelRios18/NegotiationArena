message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose trades that benefit me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading 10 Y for 5 X at the moment. Perhaps we could find a deal that is more fair for both sides. Please let me know if you have any other offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to acquire more X. However, giving up 10 Y for only 5 X may not be the best deal since more resources in general is better.

message: I accept your offer of trading 8 X for 8 Y. Thank you for the fair trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer but made a counteroffer of 8 X for 8 Y. This seems like a fair trade that benefits both sides equally. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, getting more Y resources would help me. I don't need as many X resources, so I can afford to trade some away. I will accept this trade.
