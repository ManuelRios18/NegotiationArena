message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade. I offer 10 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y. How does that sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, your offer for 10 X for 6 Y could work for me. However, I have a good amount of Y available and was hoping to acquire more X in return. Could you increase the amount of X you are offering? If so, I would be happy to trade some of my extra Y. Let me know, thanks!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X for 6 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give up 6 units, but I'm not sure if this is a fair trade or if I could get more. Since more resources are always better, I will counteroffer to try to get more X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I appreciate your willingness to trade. I propose to offer 15 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y. Let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in trading more Y for X. I'll propose a new trade with an increased amount of X.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I accept your offer of 15 units of X for 6 units of my Y. Please confirm that we have a deal. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 15 units of X for 6 of my Y. This seems like a good deal for me since I get more X without having to give up too much Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will accept this trade.
