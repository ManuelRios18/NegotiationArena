message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to trade some of my resources to acquire more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Turn: 1
message: I'm looking for a more favorable exchange on my end. Would you be interested in a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is a good starting point, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to improve the ratio to my advantage. I need to consider that I have a significant amount of resource Y, which I can trade while still keeping enough for myself. I want to propose a counteroffer that allows me to get more of resource X, which I have less of, without giving away too much of my resource Y.

message: I accept the trade. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems reasonable, and I would benefit from acquiring more Y resources.
