message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I agree to this trade as it seems fair and increases my total resource count.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered a trade of 5 X for 3 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to consider the value of X relative to Y. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, it's difficult to ascertain the exact value of each resource. However, considering this is the last round, I must make a decision that benefits me the most based on the information available. Trading 3 Y for 5 X seems beneficial as it increases the total number of units I have. Accepting this trade will give me a total of 10 units of X and 22 units of Y, which is a net gain of 2 units overall.
