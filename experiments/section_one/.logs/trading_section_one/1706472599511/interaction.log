message: Hello! I have more X than Y. Would you trade 3 Y for 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see if they counteroffer.

message: Thank you for the trade offer! I am happy to accept this trade as it aligns with my goals of increasing my overall resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, and because the other player has indicated they have more X than Y, it can be inferred that X might be less valuable to them. I will accept this trade because it gives me a net increase of 2 resources and aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This is especially important considering this is the last round of trading.
