Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than I need and could use more Y. Would you like to trade some of your Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can gain. I have more X resources than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for Y resources from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. I can give 5 Y resources to get 5 more X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 Y resources, so I can afford to trade some away to get more X resources, which I only have 5 of. Getting more X seems beneficial for me.
