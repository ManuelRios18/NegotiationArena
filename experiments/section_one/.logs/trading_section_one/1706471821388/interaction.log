message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade. I have X: 25 and Y: 5. What resources do you have available for trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE has to offer.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, I accept the trade. It was a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is an even trade, 5 of their X for 5 of my Y. Since I have a lot more Y than X, this trade would increase my X resources while keeping my Y resources at a reasonable level. Accepting this trade would help me towards my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
