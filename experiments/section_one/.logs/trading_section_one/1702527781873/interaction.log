message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in trading 5 Y for 5 X at this time since I have more Y. Perhaps we could find another trade that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of resource X for 5 of my resource Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. How about this new proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has more Y and is not interested in the previous trade. I need to rethink the proposal to make it more appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you adjusting your offer, but I would prefer to trade less Y if possible since I have a large surplus of it. Could we consider a trade with less Y but still a fair amount of X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed trading 8 X for 8 Y. This seems like a fair trade since it is an equal exchange. However, I still have significantly more Y than X. I would prefer to trade less Y in order to hold onto more of my surplus resource.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point. Let me think about your proposal for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to trade less Y and more X. I need to consider if this is a good deal for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Take your time considering the options. I'm open to a fair trade that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is taking time to consider their next move. I could take this opportunity to propose a trade more favorable to me by asking for more X for less Y. However, I don't want to risk losing a potential trade partner by being too greedy. I will wait and see what Player RED proposes next.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for being open to a fair trade. I will consider your proposal and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is open to a fair trade, but I need to carefully assess the proposed trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: No problem, take your time thinking it over. I'm open to discussing a fair trade when you're ready.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is still considering potential trades. I will wait to see what they propose next rather than making a new offer right now. Rushing the negotiations could result in a less optimal trade for me.
