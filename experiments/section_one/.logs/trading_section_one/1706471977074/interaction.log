message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in giving up more resources than I gain. Could we discuss a trade where I gain more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade gives me less total resources than I currently have. I should try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective. How about a trade that is more balanced and beneficial for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in giving up more resources than they gain. Let's propose a new trade that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You make a fair point about a balanced trade. I would be willing to trade 3 X resources if I could gain some Y resources in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is more balanced, but still results in me losing 1 total resource. I could counter to try and gain resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point. Let's make a trade that benefits both of us. How about this: I give you 5 X resources and 2 Y resources, and you give me 3 X resources and 2 Y resources in return?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to trade X resources for some Y resources. I need to carefully consider this to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, I accept your latest offer which allows us both to benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE

reason: The new proposed trade gives me 2 additional X resources without losing any Y resources. This meets my goal of gaining total resources, while still being balanced.
