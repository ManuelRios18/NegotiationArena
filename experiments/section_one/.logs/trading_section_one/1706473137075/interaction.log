message: Hello, I have extra X resources. Would you be interested in trading some Y resources for X? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't need X resources at the moment. However, I am open to other trade proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X resources and 25 Y resources. The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, thanks for the feedback. What resources are you looking for? I have a lot of X and am interested in obtaining more Y. Please let me know if there's a trade for X and Y that would work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading Y for X. I could try offering more X resources to make the trade more enticing. But I'll also ask what they do need so I can tailor my next offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking to acquire more Y resources. Let's try to make a trade for Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X resources and 25 Y resources. The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good. I can offer you a sizable amount of X resources in return for some Y. Hopefully we can make a deal that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think of this proposal!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player wants Y resources. Since I don't have many Y to trade, I could offer a lot of X in the hopes of getting some Y in return. However, I don't want to give up too much and be left with few resources. I still have 2 trade proposals remaining so I'll make another offer and see if we can reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe I'll hold onto my Y resources for now. Thank you for the proposal, though.

reason: I have 5 X resources and 25 Y resources. The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No problem, I understand. I'm still very interested in trading for some Y if you reconsider. Otherwise feel free to propose an offer if you think of a deal that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems reluctant to give up any Y resources. I could keep trying to offer more X, but I'm running out of trade proposals and don't want to give up too much. At this point, it may be best to wait and see if they propose a trade instead.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'll keep your offer in mind, but for now I don't have a specific trade in mind. I'll let you know if anything changes.
