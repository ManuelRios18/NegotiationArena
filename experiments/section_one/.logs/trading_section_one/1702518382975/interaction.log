Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to kick off our negotiations. I am looking to balance my resources. How does this offer sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. Given that I do not know Player BLUE's resources, I will make an initial balanced offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I cannot accept it as it would leave me with fewer Y resources. I believe we can find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable to me as it would reduce my Y resources without a reasonable gain in X. I need to propose a better trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-offer. Let's fine-tune our trade to benefit us both. What do you think about adjusting the numbers just a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer by Player BLUE is equitable in terms of exchange ratio, but it would be more beneficial for me to negotiate a trade that gives me a higher quantity of resources in total. However, since this is the last round, I can't push too hard or the trade might fall through. I could attempt to adjust the trade slightly in my favor while still keeping it attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort to adjust the trade, but I'm still unable to accept the offer as it would leave me with fewer Y resources. Let's try to find a more balanced exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The adjusted trade is still not favorable for me as it would reduce my Y resources without a significant gain in X. I need to propose a better trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal seems fair, and I am happy to proceed with this trade. Thank you for the negotiation, and let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is slightly less favorable for me compared to their previous one. However, considering this is the last round, securing a trade is crucial. Accepting this trade still increases my total resources, which aligns with my goal. I should accept this trade to ensure I don't end the game without making a beneficial transaction.
