player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have a significant amount of resource X, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but still leans slightly in my favor to start negotiations. I will offer less of my abundant resource in exchange for more of the less abundant one.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 10 X for 15 Y. This will give me a net resource gain. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y from me. I have 5 X and 25 Y. Acquiring more resources is my goal. This trade would give me a net gain of 5 more resources (10 X - 15 Y + my original 5 X and 25 Y), so I should accept it.
