message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade but am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I'll start with a proposal that favors me but still offers resources to the other player. This way, I can open negotiations and adjust the offer based on the counter-proposal.

message: Hello Player RED. I am afraid I cannot accept your offer of 10 X for 15 Y, as that would result in a net loss of resources for me. However, I am open to a fair counter-offer that allows us both to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y from me. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more X while giving up less Y.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I believe we can find a more balanced exchange. Please consider my revised proposal below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE seems to be slightly in their favor considering the proposed exchange rate. I would like to negotiate for a more even trade. I'm proposing a slightly more balanced trade, keeping in mind that I can only make three proposals.

message: Thank you for revising your offer, Player RED. I appreciate you working with me towards a fair trade. I have a counter-proposal that I believe benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a revised offer of 12 X for 10 Y. This improves the deal for me, but I think I could still get more X for less Y. Since I have 3 proposals available, I will make another counter-offer.

message: I'm glad we're progressing towards an agreement. Here is my final proposal, taking into account both of our interests. I look forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is still not in my favor, considering the ratio of X to Y. I want to make a third and final proposal that is closer to a 1:1 trade, which would be beneficial for maximizing my resources while still keeping the trade attractive to Player BLUE. After this proposal, I can only accept or reject offers.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer of 10 X for 8 Y. I believe this is a fair trade that benefits us both. Thank you for negotiating in good faith!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come down to 10 X for 8 Y. This is still an improvement over their initial offer, and gets me more X while giving up less Y. I'm down to my last proposal, so I think it's best if I accept this offer rather than trying to negotiate further and risk ending without a deal.
