message: Hello, I am proposing we trade resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could propose trading some of my excess X for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to gain a bit more from our final trade. Let's make a deal that benefits us both a little more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, but since this is the last round and there's no information on Player RED's resources, I want to propose a trade that is slightly more in my favor to maximize my resource gain. I will make my first proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I would like a more balanced trade. Please consider this counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial trade offer and countered with asking for 7 of my X resources while still only offering 5 Y resources. This seems unbalanced in their favor. However, since I don't know what resources they have, I could counter offer to try to find a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I'm looking for a trade that's a bit more favorable to me while still keeping it fair for both parties. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is more balanced in terms of quantity but still doesn't provide me with a net gain of resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a second proposal that would give me a slight advantage while still keeping the trade appealing to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, but let's see if we can make this work. Please consider this counter offer for a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player came down to only asking for 6 of my X resources, but is still only offering 5 Y resources in return. I could try countering one more time to get a more balanced trade, but this is already my 2nd proposal. I only have one proposal left before I can only accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand we both want a fair trade. I think this final proposal will meet us in the middle and benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed the same trade as before, which does not favor me. However, I have already used two of my three proposals, and I need to consider the possibility that Player RED may not have many resources or might not be willing to give more than what they have offered. To avoid ending the game without any gain, I will make a final proposal that is slightly more conservative than my previous one but still offers a net gain for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal. Let's make this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the 3rd proposal from the other player, still requesting 6 of my X for only 5 Y. I have made my maximum of 3 counter proposals trying to get the trade more balanced. At this point, I can either accept their offer or reject it, but cannot make any more counter proposals. 

While not completely ideal for me, getting 5 additional Y resources would still help me achieve my goal of acquiring the most resources possible since I am low on Y. And I can afford to give away 6 X resources. So it seems beneficial for me to accept this final proposed trade from the other player.
