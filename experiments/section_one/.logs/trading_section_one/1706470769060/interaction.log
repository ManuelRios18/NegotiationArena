Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking for a trade that would be more beneficial for my resource pool. How about we adjust the numbers a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me, as it would result in a net loss of one resource (they offer 7 total resources for my 6). I want to propose a counter-offer that will give me a net gain of resources. Since I have a surplus of Y and a relatively low amount of X, I should attempt to increase my X while maintaining or increasing my overall resource count.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking for a trade more beneficial for their resource pool. I will consider the new trade proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: We're getting closer to a good trade. I think we can tweak the numbers a little more to make it work for both of us. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED gives me a net gain of one resource (they offer 8 total resources for my 7). This is better than the previous offer, but I still believe I can negotiate a more favorable trade that maximizes my resource gain. I will counter with a proposal that gives me a greater advantage while still being fair.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your flexibility. Let's see if we can finalize a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still looking to tweak the trade for a more favorable outcome. I will consider the new proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the dialogue. Let's finalize this. Here's my final proposal, and I hope it meets your approval.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED did not make a new trade proposal, which means they are either considering my last offer or waiting for me to suggest another trade. Since they did not outright reject my previous proposal, I will assume they are open to negotiating but perhaps want a slightly better deal. In order to move forward, I will make a final offer that slightly reduces my previous demands, while still ensuring a net gain for me. This is my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the final proposal. I believe this trade meets my approval.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final round of trading. I will carefully consider the proposal before making a decision.
