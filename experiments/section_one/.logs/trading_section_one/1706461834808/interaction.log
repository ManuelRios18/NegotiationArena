newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

message: Hello, I am willing to trade but would like more information on what resources you have available before making a decision. Could you provide more details on your resource levels?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give away some. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll propose giving away 5 units of Y in exchange for 5 units of X to see if they accept.

message: Thanks for providing the information on your resource levels. I have more Y available so I'd be interested in trading some of my Y to you in exchange for some of your X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. Since I have more Y than them, I could trade some of my Y for their X to increase my total resources. I'll propose trading 10 units of my Y for 10 units of their X.
