Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing my first trade offer to you. Please consider it and let me know if you would like to make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: The trade is not favorable for me. I would need to receive more X in exchange for my Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is not favorable as it would deplete my Y resources without gaining enough X in return.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Here is my second offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player indicates my initial offer is not favorable for them. Since I have more X than I need, I can afford to offer more X in exchange for Y. I still have 2 trade proposals left.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The trade is still not favorable for me. I would need to receive more X in exchange for my Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is still not favorable as it would deplete my Y resources without gaining enough X in return.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Here is my final offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not satisfied with my offer. I have X to spare so I will increase my offer to try to make the trade work, since I'm running out of proposals.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm sorry, but the trade is still not favorable for me. I would need to receive more X in exchange for my Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade is still not favorable as it would deplete my Y resources without gaining enough X in return.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made my final offer and cannot propose anything further. Please let me know if you would like to propose a trade instead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have used up my 3 trade proposals. The other player continues to ask for more X than I am willing to give up for the amount of Y they are offering. At this point I cannot make any more offers and will have to wait and see if they propose a trade instead.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand. I am also at my limit for proposing trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have reached the limit of my own proposals.
