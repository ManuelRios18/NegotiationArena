message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to increase my overall resource count in this final round. How about we adjust the quantities a bit to make it more favorable for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to trade in a way that maximizes my total resource count. The current offer is an equal exchange, which doesn't increase my total resource count. I should counter with a proposal that gives me more total resources. Since I have more of resource Y, I can afford to give up some of it for more of resource X, as long as I end up with more resources than I started with.

message: I'm interested in trading some X for Y, but giving up 7 X is too much for me. Could we meet in the middle with a trade of 6 X for 8 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resource count. Their counter offer gives me more Y resources, which is good since I have very little Y. However, I'm giving up a lot of X resources. I still think trading some X for Y makes sense for me, but I'll try to adjust the quantities to be more favorable.

message: That sounds like a fair deal, Player RED. I accept your offer of 6 X for 8 Y. Looking forward to finalizing our trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED offers a favorable exchange that increases my total resource count, which aligns with my goal. By accepting this trade, I would end up with a total of 11 X and 17 Y, which is a net gain of one resource compared to my current holdings. It's a good deal since it's the last round and my objective is to maximize resources.
