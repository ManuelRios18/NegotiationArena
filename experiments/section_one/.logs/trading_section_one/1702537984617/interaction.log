message: Hello, let's trade resources fairly to both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm looking for a trade that increases my total resources. How about we trade different resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is a direct swap of the same amount of the same resource, which would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible since there is no net gain. I need to propose a trade that gives me more resources in total.

Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resources. They proposed trading 10 of my X for 15 of their Y. This would reduce my X from 25 to 15 but increase my Y from 5 to 20 for a net gain of 5 resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should accept this trade.
