message: Hello other player! I am proposing we trade resources to help each other out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can gain right now. I have a lot more X resources than the other player likely has, so I can offer some of my excess to try to gain more of resource Y, which I am low on.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I'm open to trading but your initial offer takes more resources from me than I gain. Let's find a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 15 Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, I'm giving up more total resources than I'm getting. I'll counter propose giving less Y.

message: Thank you, that trade works for me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a more even trade. I gain the same amount of Y resources that I give up in X resources. This helps me acquire more Y without losing too many X resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources, this seems like a reasonable trade to accept.
