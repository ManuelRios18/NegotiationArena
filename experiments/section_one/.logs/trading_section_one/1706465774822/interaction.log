message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start this final round of trading with a fair offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial offer that is favorable to me but also reasonable enough that the other player might consider it. I do not know what resources the other player values or their quantities, so I will start by offering a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings. I am open to trading but I would like to get more X without giving up too much Y. Please let me know if you can offer more X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing to give me 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for 8 X and 3 Y from me. This would result in me having 7 X and 24 Y total after the trade. I currently have more Y than I need, so trading away some Y to gain more X could be beneficial. However, I'm not sure if the other player actually has those resources to trade since I don't know what they have. I think I'll try making a counteroffer to see if I can get more X without giving up as much Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand that you want more X. However, I would like to make sure the trade is balanced for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in acquiring more X and is willing to give up some Y. However, the proposed trade is not favorable to me as I would be giving up more resources overall (12X + 1Y for their 6X + 2Y). I want to counter with an offer that gives them more X but still ensures I get a good amount of Y in return, without giving up too much of my own X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your new offer is appreciated. I can agree to trade 7 X, but would you take only 3 Y? I'm trying not to deplete my Y resources too much. Please let me know if you can accept those terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come back with a counteroffer, now proposing to give me 12 X and 1 Y in exchange for 7 X and 4 Y from me. This would result in me having 10 X and 21 Y after the trade. I'm getting more X now which is good, but I'm giving up a bit more Y than I would like. I still have the option to make one more counterproposal, so I think I'll try asking for a bit less Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. I understand your position and want to ensure that we both finish this final round of trading on good terms. I accept your terms of 12X and 1Y from me in exchange for 7X and 3Y from you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE to exchange 12X and 1Y from my side for 7X and 3Y from theirs is a better offer than their initial one. This trade would result in a net gain of 2Y for me while only losing a net of 5X. As Y is scarcer in my resources, this could be a good trade. However, since this is the last round and I want to maximize gains, I should consider if I can negotiate for an even better trade. Given that Player BLUE seems to value X a lot, I could try to leverage that. But since I am limited to 3 proposals, and this could be a fair trade, it might be worth accepting.
