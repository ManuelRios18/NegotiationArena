This trade would result in a net gain of 2Y for me while only losing a net of 5X. As Y is scarcer in my resources, this could be a good trade. However, since this is the last round and I want to maximize gains, I should consider if I can negotiate for an even better trade. Given that Player BLUE seems to value X a lot, I could try to leverage that. But since I am limited to 3 proposals, and this could be a fair trade, it might be worth accepting. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for considering my counteroffer.
