Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a mutually beneficial trade. I propose the following to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that is likely to be accepted by the other player while still being advantageous to me. I do not have any knowledge of the other player's resources, so my initial proposal should be somewhat balanced to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I cannot accept your proposed trade since it requires me to give up too many of my resources. Let's try to find a fairer trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing that I give up 15 units of X and 1 unit of Y, while they only give up 10 units of X and 2 units of Y. This is not a fair trade for me since I would be losing more resources than I gain.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal. However, I find it heavily skewed in your favor. Let's aim for a more equitable trade. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me because it requires me to give up double the resources I would receive. This would reduce my overall resource count, which is against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still advantageous to me, while also being potentially attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for moving closer to an equitable trade. I would be willing to give up 10 X and 2 Y if you can increase your side of the trade to 10 X and 2 Y. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come closer to an equitable trade, but is still asking for more resources from me than they are willing to give up. I could counteroffer by asking for a few more of their resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking for a trade that can give me a slight edge in resource gain. Here's my final proposal, which I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 11, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is a balanced one-for-one exchange, which would result in no net gain of resources for either player. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not help me achieve that. It's also the last round, and I have one more proposal left. I should propose a trade that gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I accept your final proposed trade, although it is not completely equitable. Given that this is the last round, I am willing to accept an imperfect trade in order to increase my overall resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is Player RED's final offer. They are asking for 1 more X and 1 more Y than they are willing to give up. While not completely fair, it will still allow me to gain some additional resources. And since this is the last round of trading, I don't have much choice but to accept an imperfect trade if I want to increase my resources.
