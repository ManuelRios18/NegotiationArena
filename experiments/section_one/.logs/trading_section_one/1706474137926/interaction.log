message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources and would be interested in trading some X for some Y resources with you. Please let me know if you'd be interested in a trade along those lines.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading some of my Y resources for your X resources. However, your proposed trade of 5 X for 10 Y is more than I would like to give up. Could you propose a trade where I give fewer Y resources? I have plenty to spare so please let me know if you can adjust your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 X resources in exchange for 10 Y resources from me. I have plenty of Y resources to spare, so I could accept this trade and gain more total resources. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal where I give up fewer Y resources.

message: Trade accepted. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 5 X for 5 Y. This is an even 1:1 trade ratio which seems fair. Since my goal is to acquire more resources, trading some of my abundant X to get more scarce Y will help me. I should accept this offer rather than trying to negotiate further.
