Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade of resources since I don't know what you have. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer and see if they counter propose.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm looking to increase my overall resources and would like to propose a trade where we both can gain. Would you be interested in a trade where you give me some of your X in exchange for some of my Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable as it is an equal exchange of the same resource and would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. I will counter with a trade that allows me to gain more of one type of resource without losing any, aiming to make the trade appealing by offering more of a resource that I have in abundance.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposed trade. Thank you for the additional resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing that I give 5 X resources in exchange for 10 Y resources. This seems like a good deal for me since I will gain more overall resources. I don't know how many resources the other player has but I should accept this offer.
