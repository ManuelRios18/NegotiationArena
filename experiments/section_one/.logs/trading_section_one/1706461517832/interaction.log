message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in increasing my Y resources. I propose the following trade: I can offer you a significant amount of X in exchange for some of your Y. Let's start with this offer and see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round and I don't know what resources the other player has or wants, I'll make a balanced initial offer, giving away some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for more of the scarce one (Y), hoping that the other player has a surplus of Y.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading some of my Y resources for your X. However, your initial offer of 10 X for 3 Y feels a bit imbalanced to me. Could you offer 12 X for 3 Y instead? I think that would be more fair. Let me know if you can increase your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X for 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, this seems like a reasonable trade to consider. I should try to get more X while giving up less Y.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am willing to accept this trade. It was a pleasure negotiating with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, considering I still have a good amount of X resources left. It would leave me with 13 X and 8 Y, which is a fairly balanced outcome. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my resources, and this trade seems like a good opportunity to increase my scarce resource without depleting my abundant one too much.
