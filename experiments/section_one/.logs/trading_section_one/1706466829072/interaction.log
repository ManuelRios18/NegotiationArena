Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an exchange to benefit us both. Let's start with a fair trade and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or what they might value, I will make an initial balanced offer to open negotiations and gauge their response. I will offer more of resource X which I have in abundance in exchange for some of their resource Y, assuming they might need X. This will also help me maintain a good stock of both resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe we can find a trade that benefits both of us. However, I would need a trade that helps me increase my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems a bit unbalanced. I have more Y than X and I want to increase my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your goal to increase your overall resources. I am willing to offer you a greater amount of X in exchange for some of your Y, ensuring that you receive a net gain in total resources. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their overall resources which implies they are interested in a trade that would give them a net gain. I can propose a trade that still gives me more of resource Y, which I have less of, while offering them more total resources. I will offer a larger amount of my abundant resource X for a smaller amount of their resource Y to keep the trade appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the adjustment in the trade. I believe this trade is fair and beneficial for both of us. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer seems more balanced now. I can increase my X while still maintaining a decent amount of Y.
