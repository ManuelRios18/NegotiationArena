message: Hello, I am proposing an equal trade since I don't know what resources you have. Please let me know if you would like to trade equal amounts of X and Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept.

message: Hello Player RED, I would prefer to trade in a way that helps me balance my resources better. I can offer you more of my Y resource in exchange for your X. Let's see if the following trade works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 15 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it's better for me to propose a trade that is favorable to me. I don't know what the other player's resources are, but I can attempt to trade more of my abundant resource (Y) for their X, which I have less of. I'll start with a proposal that gives me more X than I'm giving. I will avoid trading Y on a one-to-one basis since I already have a lot of it.

message: Trade accepted. Thank you for the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering me 15 Y resources for 10 X resources. This helps the other player balance their resources more, so they likely have more X than Y. The trade also benefits me since I get more total resources (15 Y vs the 10 X I'm giving up). I'll accept this trade since it moves me closer to my goal of acquiring more total resources.
