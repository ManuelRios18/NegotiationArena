message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I propose the following trade: I give 10 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit each other.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, your trade seems reasonable and it increases my total resources. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my total resources. Player RED is offering 10 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. Since the goal is to maximize resources, and not having any preference over X or Y, the trade seems fair as it increases my total amount of resources by 2. However, I need to ensure that I'm not giving away resources I have less of, which in this case is X. Accepting this trade would leave me with 17 units of Y and 15 units of X, which is a balanced outcome considering both resources are equally valuable to me.
