message: Hello! I have a lot of resource X and could use more resource Y. Would you be interested in trading some Y for X? Let's both try to end this round with more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I can afford to give some away to get more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I am willing to trade some Y for X but I think 10 Y is too much for me to give up. Could we trade 5 Y instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 10 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. I have 25 Y and only 5 X, so trading some Y for X could help balance my resources. However, since the goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I don't want to trade too much Y away.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is only willing to trade 5 Y for 10 X. While less than I originally proposed, this would still give me more Y overall to help meet my goal of acquiring the most resources possible. I think I should accept this trade.
