message: Hello Player BLUE, let's trade resources fairly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know Player BLUE's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources, not just exchange the same amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have the same amount of X as the other player is offering, so this trade doesn't help me acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Here is a new offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is not interested in an equal trade. Since I don't know their resources, I will propose trading some of my abundant resource X for their unknown resource Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm afraid I can't accept this offer as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I'm still aiming to acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 units of Y for 10 units of X would imbalance my resources and not align with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I only have one more proposal left. Please consider this offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my offer again, implying they have few resources to trade away. I still don't know what resources they actually have. I will propose trading more of my abundant resource X in hopes of getting more of their unknown resource Y. This is my last proposal attempt.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I have to decline as it wouldn't help me acquire more resources. I'm still focused on increasing my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 10 units of Y for 15 units of X would leave me with fewer resources overall and not align with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I'm out of proposal attempts. Please make an offer and I will consider accepting to maximize my resources for the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have used up my 3 proposal attempts without success. Player BLUE seems intent on acquiring more resources overall without revealing information about their resources. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my resources. I will accept their next offer as long as it gets me more resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I understand. I will propose a trade that will benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to make an offer that will help me acquire more resources.
