message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm not interested in giving up 5 Y resources. Could we trade less Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than the other player is offering, so I don't want to give up 5 Y. I could counter offer less Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand. I can adjust the trade to give less Y. How about X: 5, Y: 2 for X: 3, Y: 3?
player answer: NONE

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in adjusting the trade to give less Y. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Deal accepted. Thanks for trading!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has adjusted their offer to trade less Y resources. This seems like a fair trade to me since I would get more total resources. I will accept it.
