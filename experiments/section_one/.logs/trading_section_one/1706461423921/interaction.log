message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in acquiring more of resource Y. I propose a trade where I give you some of my excess resource X. Let's find a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that benefits me but is also appealing enough to the other player to consider. I will offer less of the resource I have more of (X) for more of the resource I presume they have more of (Y), assuming they have opposite resources to me. This is a common starting point for negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED. I am open to trading some of my excess Y for your X, but 15 units of Y is too high a price. I counteroffer trading 10 units of my Y for your 10 units of X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. I have more Y than X, so I could accept losing some Y to gain more X. However, 15 units of Y seems too high of a price. I will counteroffer with less Y.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand that a one-to-one trade is more comfortable for you. However, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade that would still be beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected the initial offer but has counteroffered with a one-to-one trade, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. I want to propose a slightly more favorable trade for me, giving away less of my resource X while still acquiring a significant amount of resource Y. This should maintain goodwill while also pushing for a better outcome for myself. This is my second proposal.

message: Player RED, while I appreciate you trying to find a fair deal, I believe trading 10 of my valuable Y for only 8 of your plentiful X is still not equivalent. I would be willing to trade 8 of my Y for your original offer of 10 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving 8 units of X for 10 units of my Y. This means I would gain less X than originally proposed, but would still lose the same amount of Y. I still think the ratio is unfair considering I have much more Y than X. I will counter again to try to get a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, your offer is fair. I agree to trade 10 of my X for 8 of your Y. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is more reasonable and closer to a balanced trade, offering 8 Y for 10 X. Given that this is the last round of trading, it's important to make a decision that maximizes my resources while also considering the deal's closure. Accepting this trade would provide a net gain of resources and bring me closer to achieving my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This seems like a fair trade, and it is best to secure the resources now rather than risk over-negotiating and ending up with no trade at all.
