message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing the following trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to propose a different trade. Let's make it more balanced in terms of resource numbers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers an equal amount of X for half the amount of Y. Without knowledge of their resources, it is difficult to gauge the value of this trade. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it would be more beneficial to propose a trade that offers fewer Y for the same amount of X. This way, I could increase my total amount of resources.

message: I accept your counter offer Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has counter offered with a more balanced trade of me giving 5 X resources for 8 Y resources. Since I have a lot more X than Y, this trade would help balance out my resources while still giving me a net gain of resources. I should accept this trade.
