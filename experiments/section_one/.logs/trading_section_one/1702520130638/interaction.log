message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Let's start this final round with an offer. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I'll make a balanced initial proposal that doesn't compromise my resource pool too much but shows willingness to trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I believe the trade is fair, but I would like to propose a slightly different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade seems fair, but I could try to negotiate for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I find it acceptable and am happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is better for me as I give away fewer X resources and receive more in return. It aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade will give me a net gain in total resources, which is beneficial.
