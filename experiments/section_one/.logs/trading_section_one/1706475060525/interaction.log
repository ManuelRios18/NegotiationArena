Turn: 0
message: Hello, I have extra X resources. Would you be willing to trade some Y resources for X resources? Let's start with a small trade and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to this trade. It's a fair starting point.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems fair, as both X and Y resources are being traded in a small amount for an initial exchange. Since the trade ratio is slightly in my favor with a 5:3 X for Y, and considering that more resources are always better, it would be strategic to accept this trade. This will also leave room for a potential second trade where I could negotiate for even more favorable terms if needed. Moreover, accepting this trade would increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
