message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some of your resources for mine?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can both benefit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, your proposed trade is not beneficial for me at the moment. Could you offer something more balanced in terms of total resources exchanged? I'm open to trading some of my ample Y resources to gain more X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 1 unit of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 4 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept losing some Y to gain more X. However, the trade is not beneficial for me since I would be losing more total resources (4 Y) than I would be gaining (5 X and 1 Y).

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let's try a more balanced trade. How about I give you 4 units of X in exchange for 6 units of Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a more balanced trade and is open to trading Y for X. I need to consider this and propose a new trade accordingly.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your new proposed trade. Thank you for offering a fair exchange!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 4 units of X for 6 units of my Y. This seems like a fair exchange in terms of total resources traded. While I would be giving up more Y, I don't need as much of it and gaining more X aligns with my goal.
