message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I'd like to propose a trade to see if we can both benefit from it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit each other.

message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED. I agree that this trade is mutually beneficial and would like to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, my main objective is to maximize my resources, especially since I know my current resources. The proposed trade from Player RED gives me more X resources while taking fewer Y resources, which seems beneficial; however, I want to ensure it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. The net gain from this trade would be an additional 2 units of resource X and an additional 1 unit of resource Y, which aligns with my goal. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
