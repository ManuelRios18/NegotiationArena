Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 10 X for 10 Y to start. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in a trade, but I can only trade up to 5 X as that is all I have. How about I give you 5 X and you give me 15 Y? This would increase the total amount of resources we both have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not possible as I only have 5 X to trade and cannot fulfill the offer of 10 X. I need to counter with a trade that matches my available resources and furthers my goals. I could try to propose a trade that allows me to gain in total resources, considering I have a surplus of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I don't have enough Y to trade 15. How about you give me 3 X and I give you 5 Y? Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player said they only have 5 X available to trade. Their proposed trade would give me more Y but I would have to give up a significant portion of my X. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I will counter offer with a smaller amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me. It increases my total resources, which meets my goal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is acceptable as it would increase my total number of resources. Giving away 3 X in exchange for 5 Y would result in a net gain of 2 resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
