message: Hello! I am proposing an even trade to start. Please let me know if you would like to trade resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am not interested in an even trade at this time since my goal is to maximize my resources. Please let me know if you have any other trade offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing an even 5 for 5 trade of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I don't want to give up resources unless I can get more in return.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to maximize your resources. I can offer 5 units of Y for 10 units of X. Please let me know if you'd be interested in trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in an even trade and wants to maximize their resources. I still don't know what resources they have. I'll propose giving some of my less valuable resource Y in exchange for more valuable X to see if they will accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately I do not have 10 units of X to give. I only have 5 units. I'm happy to trade but I need a deal that allows me to maximize my total resources. Please let me know if you have any other offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is now proposing to give me 5 units of Y for 10 units of my X. I only have 5 units of X to give, and since my goal is to maximize resources, giving away that much of X for only 5 units of Y does not help me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can offer 10 units of my resource Y in exchange for your 5 units of X. This allows us both to increase our total resources. Please let me know if you'd accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now I know the other player only has 5 units of X. Since they want to maximize resources, I could offer 10 units of Y for their 5 units of X. This allows us both to increase our total resources.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
