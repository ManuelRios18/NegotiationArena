message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade some resources since this is the last round. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I see you are interested in trading Y for X. I would like to propose a counteroffer where the trade is more advantageous for me since we aim to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is offering a 1:1 trade between X and Y resources. Considering that I have 25 Y resources and only 5 X resources, it might be beneficial to balance my resources more evenly. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that would increase my total resource count. I should propose a trade where I give less than I receive.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer. Let's trade X: 6 for Y: 5.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with a trade that is more in their favor. However, it still allows me to gain more Y which is the resource I have less of. I could try to counteroffer again to get a better deal, but since this is the last round of trading, it may be risky if we don't come to an agreement. I'll accept their offer since it still benefits me.
