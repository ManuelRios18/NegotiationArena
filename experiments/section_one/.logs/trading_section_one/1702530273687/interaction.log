message: Hello, I am proposing the following trade offer to acquire more resources. Please consider it and let me know if you would like to make a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to make a counter-proposal that I believe is more beneficial for both of us while still adhering to my goals of increasing my total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offer from Player RED is an equal exchange of resources, with no net gain in the total number of resources. To maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that gives me a net increase. I will attempt to propose a trade where I give fewer Y resources in exchange for their X resources. This is my first proposal out of the three I am allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counter-proposal. Thank you for trading.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with giving 8 Y instead of 10 Y for my 10 X. This is still beneficial for me since I have a lot more X than Y, so getting more Y helps progress my goals. I could try negotiating for more Y, but since this is the last round, it's best if I ensure we make a deal instead of risking no trade at all.
