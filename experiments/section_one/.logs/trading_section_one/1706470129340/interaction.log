message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer some of my resources in exchange for yours.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I have considered your offer but I think I can get a better deal for my resources. Let me know if you can improve your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X and 2 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 3 units of Y from me. Since I have more Y than X, I could accept this trade to get more X. However, since my goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal before accepting.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position. Let me adjust the trade and offer a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a better deal. I need to reevaluate the trade to see if there's room for improvement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for improving your offer. I accept the new proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has adjusted their offer to give me 4 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 3 units of X and 3 units of Y from me. This improved trade offer provides me with net 1 more unit of X overall compared to the previous offer, while keeping the Y exchange equal. Since my goal is to maximize total resources, this new offer is better for me. I could try to negotiate further, but I'm satisfied with this deal so I will accept it.
