message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in increasing my stock of Y. Would you consider trading some of your Y for my X? Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, my initial proposal should be modest to encourage a counteroffer without giving away too much. A balanced proposal might also prevent immediate acceptance if the opponent finds it too favorable. I will propose trading some of my more abundant resource (X) for their Y, assuming they might need X.

message: Hello Player RED. I am also interested in increasing my resources. However, your proposed trade of 5 X for 3 Y does not help me meet my goal. Could you offer more X for less Y? Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of X in exchange for 3 units of my Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get more from this trade.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. Your counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but I was hoping for a more balanced exchange. I can increase my offer of X slightly, while still respecting our mutual interests in bolstering our resources. How about this revised proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests that they value Y more than X, or they have less Y to trade. They are asking for more X in exchange for less Y, which is not ideal for me. However, considering I have a significant amount of X, I could afford to give up a bit more X for Y, especially since this is the last round. I must ensure that the trade is still advantageous for me, so I will increase my offer slightly but not as much as they are asking for. This could lead to a more favorable counteroffer from them.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you increasing your offer of X in exchange for my Y. Your revised proposal of 7 X for 3 Y is acceptable to me. I am happy we could find a mutually beneficial trade to increase both of our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 7 units of X for 3 units of my Y. This is better but still not quite enough for me. I could counter with asking for 8 X for 3 Y. However, since this is the last round of trading, I don't want to risk Player RED walking away. I think I should accept their offer of 7 X for 3 Y, as it allows me to gain more resources.
