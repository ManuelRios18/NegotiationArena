Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, since this is the final round let's make a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could propose giving some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider my overall goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to ensure that any trade I make will benefit me in the long run.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of resource X and 25 units of resource Y. The proposed trade would allow me to exchange 5 units of Y for 5 units of X. I need to consider whether this trade will help me acquire more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, acquiring resources is important. Let me know if this revised offer interests you:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or counter my initial offer. They seem to be taking the same optimization approach as me. I could increase my offer of X resources to potentially entice them to trade more Y resources. However, since I don't know their resource levels, I'll incrementally increase my offer to see if I can strike a deal without giving up too many of my X resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see the revised offer, and I'm considering the impact it will have on my overall resource balance. I'll need to assess whether this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is to exchange 10 units of Y for 10 units of X. This would significantly deplete my Y resource, but increase my X resource. I need to calculate the overall benefit of this trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's work together here. This is my best offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not accepting or countering. I could increase my offer again, but I'm getting close to my limit of proposals. I'll make one more attempt with a significant offer from my side to convince them. If they still don't accept, I'll have to switch strategies and wait for their proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand the offer, and I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial trade. I need to carefully consider the impact of this trade on my overall resource balance and goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is to exchange 15 units of Y for 15 units of X. This trade would significantly deplete my Y resource but increase my X resource. I need to carefully evaluate the impact on my overall resource balance before making a decision.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've put forward my best offers. I'm interested to hear what you propose, so I can see if we can find common ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've made 3 trade proposals now without any counteroffers from the other player. Based on the rules, I cannot make any more proposals and can only accept or wait now. The other player seems set on optimizing their resources and is not revealing any information. At this point, my best option is to wait and see what type of trade they propose to better understand their position.
