Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources. Would you be interested in trading some Y for some of my X? Let's start with an offer and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 2 Y and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade that I believe is more equitable. I am willing to give more Y in exchange for a greater quantity of your X resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make sure that the trade is favorable for me. The current offer from Player RED is 5 X for 2 Y. I think I can negotiate a better deal given that I have a substantial amount of Y. Iâ€™ll counter with a proposal that gives me a greater quantity of X for my Y, ensuring I end up with more total resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair counteroffer. I am willing to trade more X, but 10 is a lot for me. Let's compromise at 7 X for 3 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with an offer to trade 10 X for 4 Y. This gives me a better ratio of Y per X traded. However, trading 10 X is a significant amount for me and reduces my total resources more. I would like to try to meet in the middle between our offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering the counteroffer. I understand that 10 X might be too much for you. I believe we can reach a fair agreement if we meet halfway from our last two proposals. How about 8 X for 3 Y? This way, I receive a slightly better exchange rate, and you don't have to part with too much of your X resource.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is for 7 X in exchange for 3 Y. This is a better ratio than the original offer, but since this is the last round, I want to maximize the gain. I might try to push for a slightly better deal without risking the negotiations since I still have room for two more counteroffers. I will propose a trade that is between the two previous offers, which might be acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your proposal of 8 X for 3 Y. I think this is a fair trade that benefits both of us in the final round.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has countered again with a proposal of 8 X for 3 Y. This meets in the middle between our last two proposals and seems fair. I'm willing to accept trading 8 X to get more Y since this is the last round.
