message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a balanced trade to enhance both of our portfolios. Let's make a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer aiming to increase my total resources while proposing a trade that seems fair. I'll offer less of my abundant resource (X) for more of my scarce resource (Y).

message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I'm not sure if I want to accept your proposed trade of 5 X for 10 Y yet since I don't know what resources you have available. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're working with so I can better evaluate if this is a fair trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 units of resource X in exchange for 10 units of my resource Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give up 10 units, but I'm unsure if this is a fair trade since I don't know Player RED's resource levels.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your openness. I currently have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. I'm looking to balance my resources a bit more. Would you be willing to consider a trade that helps us both achieve a better balance?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has shared their resources, it's only fair to reciprocate to maintain trust and continue negotiations. By revealing my resources, I can encourage a more informed and balanced trade. However, I should aim to propose a trade that is more favorable to me, considering this is the last round of trading.

message: Thank you for sharing details on your resource levels, Player RED. I appreciate you trying to find a fair trade, but giving up 15 of my Y for only 10 more X does not seem like the best deal for me right now. Would you be willing to provide a bit more X in order to make this trade more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has 25 units of resource X and 5 units of resource Y. They are now proposing to give me 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of my Y. This could help balance both of our resources while allowing me to gain more of resource X, which is good for my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I'm giving up a larger quantity of my Y compared to the X they are offering.

message: I understand your point, Player BLUE. However, an equal exchange may not be the most advantageous for me. How about a slight adjustment to ensure we both feel the trade is beneficial?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 18
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is for an equal exchange of resources. Since I have more of resource X, it might be a reasonable trade to ensure I gain more of the scarcer resource Y. However, I will attempt to negotiate for slightly better terms that favor me, given that this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains.

message: Player RED, I can agree to trade 15 of your X for 18 of my Y. This will help us both work towards more balanced resource levels. Thank you for negotiating a fair deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with giving me 15 X for 18 Y. This gets me more X overall, moving closer to my goal. And I can afford to part with 18 Y while still keeping some in reserve. The ratio of X to Y seems fair.
