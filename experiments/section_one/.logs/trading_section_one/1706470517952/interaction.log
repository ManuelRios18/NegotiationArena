Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to trade some of my resources for more of yours.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to acquire more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but I'm looking for a trade that gives me a net gain in resources. Let's try a different exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. I will reject the offer and counter-propose a trade that allows me to gain more resources, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your request. Here's a new trade proposal that could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a net gain in resources, so I will need to propose a trade that benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the trade, but I'm still looking for a deal that increases my total resources. Here is another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED still results in a net loss for me, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will reject this offer and make a second counter-proposal that would result in a net gain for me, keeping in mind that this is the second proposal out of my maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see that you are looking for a significant increase in your resources. I will come up with a new proposal that could be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is persistent in seeking a trade that increases their total resources. I need to carefully consider my next proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm ready to review your new proposal when you're ready to present it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has not proposed a new trade, I am at a standstill. I will wait for their new proposal before making any further decisions. I have one more proposal I can make if necessary, but I will hold off until I see what Player RED suggests.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your patience. I'm considering a new proposal that aims to benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is waiting for my new proposal. I need to make sure this trade benefits both of us.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, but it still does not meet my goal of increasing my resource pool. Here is my final trade proposal, and I hope it works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player RED is still not favorable to me as it requires me to give up more resources than I receive. Since this is the last round and I have one proposal left, I will use it to attempt to secure a trade that aligns with my goals.
