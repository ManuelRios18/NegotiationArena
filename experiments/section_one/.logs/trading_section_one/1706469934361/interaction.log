message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade. I'm offering 15 units of resource X in exchange for 10 units of resource Y. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Deal accepted. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 15 units of X for 10 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to give up 10 units. However, I only have 5 units of X, so getting 15 more would be very beneficial. Since more resources in general are better and this is the last round, I should accept this trade.
