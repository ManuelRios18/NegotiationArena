message: Hello! I'm proposing a trade to get more resources. Please let me know if you'd like to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being enticing enough for the other player to accept. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing a small trade to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am willing to trade some of my Y resources for your X resources, but your proposed trade ratio is not favorable for me. Could you offer more X resources for 5 of my Y resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X resources for 5 of my Y resources. Since I have more Y resources, I can afford to give some away to get more X resources, which I have less of.
