message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources? I propose the following trade: I give 10 X and 3 Y for 8 X and 6 Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start the trade with an initial proposal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That trade works for me. Let's complete the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X and 3 Y in exchange for 8 X and 6 Y. This means I would gain 2 more X but lose 3 Y. Since I have more Y than X, losing some Y to gain more X could be beneficial for me to acquire a better balance of resources.
