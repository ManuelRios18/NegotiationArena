Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit before the last round ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources, which I have fewer of. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I cannot afford to give up 3 units of resource Y for only 5 units of resource X. I need to propose a different trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as I would lose 3 units of resource Y for only 5 units of resource X. I need to make a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I cannot give up that much X. Let's try to find a fairer trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for a lot of my X resources in exchange for more Y resources. Although I'd like more Y, giving up 8 X seems too high. I'll counter offer with less X for less Y to see if we can find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but I still think I would be losing out on Y. I need to propose a different trade to ensure a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is more balanced, but I still need to ensure I'm not giving up too much Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, that trade is agreeable to me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come down in their Y request and met me halfway at 7 units each. This seems like a fair trade. I gain more of the resource I'm low on without giving up too much of what I already have a lot of. Since this is the last round, I should accept.
