message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I offer X: 10, Y: 3 | In return, I would like to receive X: 8, Y: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: That trade offer works for me. Let's make the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 units of X and 3 units of Y in exchange for 8 units of X and 5 units of Y from me. This would result in me having 7 units of X (5 original + 10 from trade - 8 given away) and 23 units of Y (25 original - 3 from trade + 5 given away). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good trade for me.
