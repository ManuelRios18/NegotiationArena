message: Hello! I have more X than Y. Would you be interested in trading some Y for my X? Let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could propose trading some X for Y. However, without knowing the other player's resources, it's hard to make a fair proposal. I'll start by offering a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! I am happy to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is beneficial as I would be getting more of X, which I have less of, while giving away less Y in return. This would help me to balance my resources and move towards my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, it is important to ensure the final trade is advantageous. The other player has indicated they have more X than Y, which aligns with the trade they proposed. Accepting this trade seems to be a good move.
