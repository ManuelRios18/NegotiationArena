message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the offer, but an even trade of X for X doesn't help either of us get ahead. How about we mix it up a bit? I'm willing to offer some of my Y resources for some of your X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the trade stands, it is an even trade of the same resource, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with an offer that allows me to gain a net increase in resources.

message: Thank you, I accept your offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed trading 10 of their Y resources for 5 of my X resources. This seems like a good deal for me since I get more resources overall. I don't know how many resources they have but I should accept while I can.
