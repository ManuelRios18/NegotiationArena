message: Hello, I have a lot of X resources and am looking for Y resources. Would you be interested in trading some Y for X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I currently have enough X resources and I'm looking to acquire more Y resources. Do you have any other offers?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and I want to maximize my resources

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no problem. I have a lot of X resources to spare, so let me know what you would be willing to trade for some of those.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Any: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in trading their Y resources for my X resources. Since I don't know what resources they have, I will make a more general offer, proposing to trade some of my abundant X resources for whatever they are willing to give up. I still want to start small in case they counter offer.

message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more Y resources. Do you have any Y resources to trade?

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I only have a small amount of Y resources, but I can offer 2 Y in exchange for some X resources. Would that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made it clear they are only interested in obtaining more Y resources. Since I only have 5 Y resources, I cannot afford to trade many away if I want to maximize my total resources. However, trading some Y may be my only option to get the other player to accept. I will propose trading 2 of my Y resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are mainly interested in X. I can offer 3 of my Y resources in exchange for 7 of your X resources. Please let me know if this trade interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player clearly values X resources highly and is unwilling to give any up. My only option at this point is to propose trading more of my scarce Y resources for X resources. I don't want to deplete all my Y, so I will offer 3 Y for 7 X. If they reject again, I will have to consider accepting whatever trade they eventually propose.

Current Iteration: 8

message: I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I can part with 7 X resources at the moment. Do you have any other offers?
