message: Hello, I am proposing the following trade offer in hopes that we can both benefit before the last round ends. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 25 units of resource X and 5 units of resource Y. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I am open to trading but your proposed exchange rate of 2 Y per 1 X seems high. Could you offer a more favorable rate for me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 5 units of X in exchange for 10 units of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, this trade would help balance my resources. However, the exchange rate seems unfavorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you would like a more equal exchange rate. I can offer 4 units of X for 5 units of Y. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player countered with an exchange rate of 1 Y per 1 X. While this is less favorable for me, it could still be beneficial to trade some of my abundant resource X for more Y before the last round ends. I still have up to 3 trade proposals so I will counter offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer Player RED. I accept trading 5 Y for 4 X. This will help increase my total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a counter offer of 4 X for 5 Y. This is an improved exchange rate for me of 1.25 Y per 1 X. Since this is the last round, I should try to maximize my total resources. I still have a lot more Y than X, so trading some Y for more X will help balance and diversify my holdings.
