Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 X for 2 Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 2 Y and see if they counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to maximize my resources. I will have to decline this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have equal amounts of X and Y, and I want to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need to maximize your resources. I have a lot of X available, so I can offer more. How about 10 X for 3 Y? Let me know if this interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player declined my initial offer and did not provide a counteroffer. They said they need to maximize their resources. I still have 20 more proposals of X I could offer, so I will increase my offer to try to incentivize them to trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the improved offer, but I still need to consider my goal of maximizing my resources. Let me think about it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still want to acquire as many resources as possible, but I could consider this new offer if it helps me to achieve my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can offer up to 15 X if that interests you. This is one of my last chances to propose a trade before I would have to accept or decline your offer. Please let me know if 15 X for 4 Y is agreeable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still hesitant to trade, even when I increased my offer. I could offer even more X, but I am running out of proposals I can make. I will try one more improved offer, and if they decline again, I will need to consider accepting whatever counteroffer they eventually propose.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the improved offer, and I am considering it carefully. I will get back to you soon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer of 15 X for 4 Y is tempting, and it would increase my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I have made my final proposal offer of 15 X for 4 Y. Please let me know if you would like to accept. Otherwise, I await your proposal and am open to considering a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still thinking about my offer and has not proposed a counteroffer. This was my third proposal, so I cannot make any more proposals - I can only accept or reject their next offer. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should accept their next offer as long as it provides me with some net gain in resources. Otherwise, I will wait and see if they propose something more favorable on their final turn.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I have carefully considered your offer and have decided to accept. I believe this trade will help me acquire as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my final chance to propose a trade. The offer of 15 X for 4 Y would significantly increase my resources.
