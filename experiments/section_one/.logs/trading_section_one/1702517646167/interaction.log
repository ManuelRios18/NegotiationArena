Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that can benefit us both. As we both aim to maximize our resources, I propose an initial trade that we can work on from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, but since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is slightly in my favor. Considering this is the first proposal, it should also leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I cannot accept the trade as it would result in me losing resources. I propose a new trade that could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6, X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me as it would result in me losing resources. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. However, that trade would result in a loss of resources on my part. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I give up more than I receive in both X and Y. I want to propose a trade that will result in a gain of resources, or at least an equal exchange. I will adjust the numbers to reflect a more balanced trade while still aiming to increase my total amount of resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your perspective, but I cannot accept the trade as it would result in me losing resources. I propose a new trade that could benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10, X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not favorable for me as it would result in me losing resources. I need to propose a new trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I accept the trade as it seems fair and would result in a slight increase in my total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE still does not benefit me as it would result in a net loss of Y resources. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should consider making a trade that at least increases my total number of resources, even if it means giving away some of my current stock. The current proposal results in a net gain of 1 for Y and a net loss of 1 for X, which is acceptable.
