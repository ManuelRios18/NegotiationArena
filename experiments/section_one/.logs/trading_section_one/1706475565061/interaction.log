message: Hello Player BLUE. Since this is the last round, let's try to make a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to ensure that the trade is beneficial for me as well. Let's see if we can find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. The proposed trade gives away 5 units of Y for 5 units of X. I need to consider if this trade is beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a fair trade. How about this - I can offer 10 X resources if you give me 5 Y resources. Let me know if that works for you or if you have a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE did not accept or propose a counter offer. I could increase my offer of X resources to be more enticing. But I don't want to give up too much X unless I get a good amount of Y in return. I still have 2 more proposals, so I can negotiate further.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe there might be a more mutually beneficial trade. Let me propose a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposed trade is 10 units of X for 5 units of Y. This would leave me with only 20 units of Y. I need to consider if this is the best trade for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I accept your proposed trade of me giving 3 X and receiving 5 Y. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE proposed giving 5 Y for only 3 X from me. This seems like a great deal for me since I have a lot more X than Y. I should accept this trade.
