Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! I have more X than I need and could use some more Y. Would you trade 5 X for 3 Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I end up with. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider if this is the best trade for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Trading 5 X for 3 Y could be beneficial as I have more X than I need. However, I should consider if I can get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if you change your mind. I could offer 6 X for 3 Y if that works better for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. I could try offering more favorable terms for them to incentive a trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The new offer is tempting. Let me consider it carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is more favorable, as I would be getting more X for the same amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I really would like to make a trade this last round. How about 7 X for 3 Y? That's a very good ratio for you. Please let me know if you'd accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems interested but still has not accepted or proposed a counter. I could offer an even more favorable trade for them to try to seal the deal since this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: The offer of 7 X for 3 Y is very tempting and I think I will accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer of 7 X for 3 Y is even more favorable to me. It's a good ratio and I should seriously consider accepting this trade.

Current Iteration: 7

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player says they are tempted to accept my offer of 7 X for 3 Y. Since this maximizes my resources, I will accept the trade.
