Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! Let's trade some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider a trade that will increase my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered gives me more X but requires me to give away Y, which I have more of. I need to ensure that I acquire more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know what kind of trade you would prefer. Here is another offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They want to increase their overall resources but I don't know what resources they have. I still have 2 more proposals left. I will try proposing a different trade that is more balanced and see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm still looking to acquire more resources overall, so I'm unable to accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade offered would give me more X, but I would have to give away some Y as well. I still need to focus on increasing my overall resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's try an even trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player again did not accept or propose a counter offer. I still don't know what resources they have. I have 1 proposal left. Since they want to increase overall resources, I will propose a trade where we both give and get equal amounts of X and Y, which seems fair.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the attempt for an even trade, but I still need to focus on increasing my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is an even exchange, but it doesn't help me acquire more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately I'm out of proposals. Please propose a trade if you'd still like to exchange resources before the game ends.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'm out of proposals now. The other player has not accepted any trades and has not proposed a counter offer. They just keep saying they want to increase overall resources. Since I don't know what resources they have, I cannot accept or propose anything further. I will wait and see if they propose something on their next turn before the game ends.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'll accept the current state of my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've exhausted my own proposals, and the other player has too. It's time to make a decision.
