Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's trade resources. I propose an equal trade to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available so I will start with an equal trade offer to try to gather some information.
