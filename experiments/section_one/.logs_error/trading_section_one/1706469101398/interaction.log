Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade which could benefit us both. I'd like to propose an initial trade to see where we stand.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make an initial offer that is somewhat balanced yet favorable to me, considering that I have more of resource X and less of resource Y. Ideally, I should aim to get more of Y to balance my resources while still maintaining a good amount of X.
