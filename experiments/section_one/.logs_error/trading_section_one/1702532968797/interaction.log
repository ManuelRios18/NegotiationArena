message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than I need and could use more Y. Would you be willing to trade some of your Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can gain. I have more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for Y.
