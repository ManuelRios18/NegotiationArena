Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to get things started. I am willing to trade some of my X for your Y, but I am open to counter-offers and finding a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a conservative offer to open negotiations. Ideally, I want to increase both my X and Y resources, but without knowing what the other player values or has excess of, I will propose a balanced trade.
