Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I have resources X and Y available for trade. Please make an offer if interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. I have a lot more X than Y, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for more Y from the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to carefully evaluate if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X, which I currently have less of, but it would cost me Y, which I have more of. I need to carefully consider if it's worth it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are evaluating my initial offer. Here is another proposal that may work better for both of us:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. They may be evaluating if my original proposal aligns with their goals. I still have X to spare, so I could propose another trade offer involving X for Y that may be more appealing.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the new offer. I am still evaluating if this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade would give me more X, but it would cost me Y, which I have more of. I still need to carefully consider if it's worth it.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need more time to evaluate the trade offers. Let me know if you have any counter proposals or decide to accept one of my offers. Otherwise, I am open to considering your proposals as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still evaluating my offers and has not proposed a counter offer. I could propose one more trade offer as I'm allowed 3 proposals. However, since they are carefully evaluating alignment with goals, I should not push further trades and wait for their decision or counter proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I have reviewed the offers and have decided to accept the second proposal. It aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have carefully evaluated the trade offers, and I believe that the second offer would benefit me more. It would give me more X, which I currently have less of, and would cost me less Y, which I have more of.
