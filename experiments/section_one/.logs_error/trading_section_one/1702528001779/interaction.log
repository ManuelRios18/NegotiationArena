message: Hello, I'm Player RED. I'm interested in making a trade. What resources do you have available?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will start by proposing a trade to see if we can benefit from exchanging resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I'm interested in trading but I'd like to know what resources you actually have available before proposing a counteroffer. Could you please confirm if you have 5 units of X to trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 5 units of Y from me. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford this trade, but I'm not sure if it's beneficial for me or if Player RED actually has 5 units of X to trade.

Current Iteration: 3

message: Yes, I can confirm that I have 5 units of X available for trading. Are you interested in making a trade based on this information?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. They want to confirm if I have 5 units of X to trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for confirming your resources. I'm interested in trading for your 5 units of X. Would you accept 4 units of Y from me in exchange? Let me know if you'd be willing to make that trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that Player RED has confirmed they have 5 units of X, I will propose a trade to acquire those units. Since they originally asked for 5 units of Y, I will counteroffer 4 units of Y instead to try to give up less while still making the trade appealing.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is considering my proposed trade. I'll wait to see if they come back with a counteroffer or accept the trade. If they reject it, I may propose giving 5 units of Y instead since they originally asked for that amount.
