Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading? I propose an initial trade to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is my first proposal and the beginning of the game, I want to make an initial offer to see how Player BLUE responds, and gauge their resource needs. I will start by offering a modest amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a similar setup. This way, I can increase my overall resource count and get closer to my goal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider my options carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need to consider your options. Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us. Here's an adjusted offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player BLUE has not accepted my initial offer and has not made a counteroffer, they might be looking for a more appealing trade or they may have a different resource distribution than I anticipated. I will make a second proposal that slightly increases the amount of resource Y offered by them in hopes to entice a counteroffer that can give me insight into their resource situation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your adjusted offer is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to carefully consider the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I still want to maximize my resources in this trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your consideration. Here is my final offer. I hope it meets your needs and we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged that my offer is getting closer to their expectations, yet they still haven't made a counteroffer. This could indicate that they are either cautious or are looking for an even better deal. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade without exceeding the limit, I will make one final offer that is more generous in hopes of securing a trade. I will increase the amount of X I am offering while still aiming for a higher amount of Y in return.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final offer is closer to what I'm looking for. Let's make a deal. I ACCEPT

reason: Player BLUE has accepted the final offer, which completes the trade. This acceptance allows me to increase my total resources, achieving my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
