message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer some of my X for your Y. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without any information on Player BLUE's resources, my initial trade proposal should be conservative but still appeal to the possibility that they might value Y over X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to increase my total number of resources while maintaining a balance. I'll propose a trade that gives me more of the resource I have less of, assuming that Player BLUE might have a surplus of Y and a need for X.
