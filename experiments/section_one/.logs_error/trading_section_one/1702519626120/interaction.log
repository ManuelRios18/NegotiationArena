message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to trade resources in a way that can be beneficial for both of us. Without knowing your resources and goals, I propose the following trade as a starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my overall resource count. I'll start with a balanced offer to see how the other player responds, keeping in mind that I can make up to 3 proposals.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25

my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
