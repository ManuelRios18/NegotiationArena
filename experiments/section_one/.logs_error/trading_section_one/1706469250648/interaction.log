Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. Let's make the best out of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I'm aiming to acquire as many resources as possible, I will attempt to make an initial trade proposal that is fair, but leans slightly in my favor. This way, there is room for negotiation, and I can adjust the proposal based on the counter-offer from Player BLUE. I don't know what Player BLUE has, so I'll start with a balanced trade proposal.
