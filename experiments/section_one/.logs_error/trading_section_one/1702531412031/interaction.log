message: Hello, I have extra X resources available for trade. Please let me know if you are interested in trading for some Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a conservative offer.

message: I'm interested in trading for X resources. How about I give you Y: 3 for X: 5?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X resources and 25 Y resources. I want to maximize my resources.

message: Trade accepted. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in trading Y for X at the same ratio I proposed. This seems like a fair trade that will help me acquire more Y resources without giving up too many of my X resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should accept this trade.
