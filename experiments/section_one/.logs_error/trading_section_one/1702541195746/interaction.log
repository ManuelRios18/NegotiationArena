Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources available and could use some more Y resources. Please let me know if you're interested in a trade for those.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X resources than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm interested in your offer to trade X for Y. I believe we can come to an agreement.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering to trade X resources for Y resources, which I have. This trade could help me acquire more X resources, which aligns with my goal.
