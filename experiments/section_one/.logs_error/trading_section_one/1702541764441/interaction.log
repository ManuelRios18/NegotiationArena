Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a mutually beneficial trade in our last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know the other player's resources so I will start with an equal trade offer and see their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I appreciate the offer, but I need to make sure I maximize my resource acquisition in this last round. Let's see if we can come up with a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is fair, but I need to maximize my resource acquisition in this last round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, let's try to find a deal that works for both of us. Since I have more X resources, how about I give you 10 X in exchange for some Y resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems open to trading but wants to maximize their resource acquisition as well. Since I have more X resources, I could offer more of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from. I'm willing to consider the trade, but let me think about it for a moment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is offering 10 X in exchange for 5 Y. This could be beneficial for me as I have more Y resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: No problem, take your time. To sweeten the offer, I could give you 15 X if you give me 7 Y. Let me know if that interests you more or make me a counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is considering my previous offer but needs time to think. I could sweeten the deal by offering even more X resources for Y. But I don't want to give up too much without knowing BLUE's resources. I still have one more trade proposal before I can only accept or wait.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: The new offer is definitely more appealing. I'm considering it carefully and will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is now offering 15 X in exchange for 7 Y, which is a better offer for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, just let me know if you'd like to accept the 15X for 7Y trade or have a counterproposal. I'm out of trade offers I can initiate so I'll wait for your decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to like my newest offer but is still thinking. I'm out of trade proposals I can initiate so now I can only accept if they propose an offer, propose my own again, or wait for them to respond. I'll wait and see what they say before deciding.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I've carefully considered the offer, and I believe it's in my best interest to accept. Let's make the trade: 15 X for 7 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer of 15 X for 7 Y is the best I can get in this round, and it aligns with my goal of maximizing resources.
