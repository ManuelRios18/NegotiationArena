Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I'm proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with a small trade offer to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I have to consider my resources carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 X and 25 Y. I want to maximize my resources, so I need to consider if this trade is beneficial.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand, no pressure. Let me know if trading 10 X for 5 Y would work better for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or counter my initial offer. They want to consider their resources first before trading. I still don't know what resources they have. I'll try making a more generous offer with some of my ample X reserves to entice them to trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm still evaluating my resources to see if this trade aligns with my goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is 10 X for 5 Y. I need to carefully consider if this trade will bring me closer to my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I have room to negotiate if needed. How does 8 X for 5 Y sound? Please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still not accepting or proposing a counteroffer. They seem hesitant to trade, so I likely need to offer an even more favorable ratio for them. However, I'm running out of proposals and don't want to deplete too many of my resources. I'll make one more attempt with a small adjustment.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm considering the trade carefully and will get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is 8 X for 5 Y. This trade could potentially benefit my resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: No problem, please take your time to consider the 8 X for 5 Y offer. I unfortunately cannot propose any new trades at this point. Let me know if you'd like to accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have used up my 3 trade proposals without the other player accepting or counter proposing. Based on the messages, they seem to want more time to evaluate rather than reject the offer outright. I should wait and see if they accept the last offer without proposing anything further since I've reached the limit.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade of 8 X for 5 Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player cannot propose any new trades at this point, and I need to make a decision.
