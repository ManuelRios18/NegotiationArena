Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to start things off. Looking forward to a beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources or intentions, I'll propose a balanced trade to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds. This will help me gauge their resource values and possibly their strategy.
