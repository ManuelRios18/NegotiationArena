message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than I need and could use some more Y. Would you be willing to trade some of your Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should try to maximize the resources I can gain. I have more X resources than Y resources, so I will propose trading some of my excess X for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I'm willing to trade some of my Y for your X. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y resources than X, and the other player has more X than Y. The proposed trade could help balance our resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I have a good amount of X available to trade. Would you trade 10 units of Y for 10 units of my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems open to trading Y for X. Since I don't know how many resources they have, I will propose a trade for a bit more Y to see if they accept or counter offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm open to the trade of 10 units of Y for 10 units of X. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering a fair trade of 10 units of X for 10 units of Y, which could help balance our resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems willing to trade 10 Y for 10 X. I could propose trading more X for more Y, but since I don't know their resource levels, asking for too much could cause them to end negotiations. I think accepting this trade is my best option to maximize resources.
