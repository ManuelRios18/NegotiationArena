message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to acquire more resources in this final round of trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 units of resource X and no units of resource Y. I want to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you are looking to acquire more resources. I can offer 10 of my X resources for 5 of your Y resources. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in an equal trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose trading 10 of my more abundant resource X for 5 of their unknown resource Y. I still have 15 X left if they reject.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm not interested in trading my Y resources for X resources at the moment. I'm focused on acquiring more resources in general.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
