Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade. Let's make it a win-win situation for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my first proposal, I want to start with a fair offer that might be appealing to the other player while also increasing my total amount of resources. I will offer some of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of their possibly less abundant resource (Y).
