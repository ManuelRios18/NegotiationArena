Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have more X resources than Y. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y resources for some of my X resources? Please let me know if you'd like to make a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has a good chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I am interested in trading for more X resources. However, I would like a little more Y resources for the amount of X you are offering. Could you increase the Y in your offer to 5? If so, I would accept that trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED says they have more X than Y. Their proposed trade gives me 5 X for 3 Y. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, getting more X would help.
