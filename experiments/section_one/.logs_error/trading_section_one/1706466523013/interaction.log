Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose a balanced exchange to start with. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I am looking to maximize my resources, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also seems fair to the other player, without knowing their resources. I'll propose a balanced trade initially to open negotiations.
