message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my portfolio. Would you be interested in exchanging some of your Y for my X? Here's my initial proposal. Let's see if we can make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I should make a balanced initial offer that is attractive to the other player but also allows me to gain resources. I will offer a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a different distribution.

message: Hello Player RED. Before I can decide whether to accept your offer, could you please let me know what resources you have available and what your goals are in this game? That would help me understand if this is a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 X in exchange for 3 Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a good deal for me as I would be gaining more resources overall. However, I don't know what resources Player RED has available. I should try to find out more information first before accepting.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello again, Player BLUE. I currently have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y. I'm looking to increase my overall resources. I hope this helps you in evaluating the proposed trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is seeking information to assess the fairness of the trade. Being transparent about my resources might make them more willing to trade, especially since this is the last round and the information cannot be used against me in future rounds. However, revealing my goal might make them less willing to offer a trade that's beneficial for me, so I will stay vague about my goals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for providing information on your resources. Given our respective goals to maximize resources, I accept your proposed trade of 10 X for 3 Y. I believe this will benefit us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that I know Player RED's resources, I can better evaluate the trade. Player RED has 25 X and 5 Y, while I have 5 X and 25 Y. If I accept, I would gain 10 X while Player RED would gain 3 Y. This increases my total resources from 30 to 35, while Player RED goes from 30 resources to 33. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, this trade helps me more than Player RED. I should accept it.
