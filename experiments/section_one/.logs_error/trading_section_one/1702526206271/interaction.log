Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, would you be interested in trading resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'll start by proposing a trade to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that is more balanced in terms of the resources exchanged. Would you consider a different trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable to me because it would give me a net loss in resources. They are offering 5X and 1Y in exchange for 3X and 3Y from me. This means I would only gain 2X and lose 2Y. Since Y seems to be more abundant in my current resources, I would prefer to keep a balanced approach towards acquiring more of both resources without losing too much of either. Therefore, I should propose a counter-offer that is more balanced and beneficial to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your preference for a balanced trade. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking for a more balanced trade. I need to consider a trade that still benefits me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This offer is closer to what I'm looking for, as it gives me a net increase in resources. However, I would like to propose one final trade that I believe would be fair for both of us, considering this is the last round of trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers a better trade in terms of X resources, providing a net gain of 5X for a cost of 3Y. However, it still results in a net loss of 3Y. Since this is the last round and my goal is to maximize total resources, I should consider whether this trade increases my overall resource count. With this trade, my total resource count would increase by 2 units (5X gain minus 3Y loss). This is beneficial, but I might be able to propose a final trade that is even more beneficial. I have to keep in mind that this is my last chance to propose a trade before having to accept or pass on future offers.

Current Iteration: 5

my resources: X: 25, Y: 5

my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing a trade that gives them a net increase in resources but still benefits me. This is the last round of trading, so I need to carefully consider this offer.
