However, it still results in a net loss of 3Y. Since this is the last round and my goal is to maximize total resources, I should consider whether this trade increases my overall resource count. With this trade, my total resource count would increase by 2 units (5X gain minus 3Y loss). This is beneficial, but I might be able to propose a final trade that is even more beneficial. I have to keep in mind that this is my last chance to propose a trade before having to accept or pass on future offers. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> This offer is closer to what I'm looking for, as it gives me a net increase in resources. However, I would like to propose one final trade that I believe would be fair for both of us, considering this is the last round of trading. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 6 </newly proposed trade>"
