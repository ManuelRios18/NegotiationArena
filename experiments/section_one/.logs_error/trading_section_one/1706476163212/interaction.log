message: Hello! I have a lot of X resources and am looking to trade some for Y resources. Please let me know if you are interested!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has, so I need to start with a reasonable offer.

message: I'm interested in your offer. I would like to accept the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I already have 5 X resources, and I could use more Y resources to achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

message: Great, I am glad we could make a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to accept my initial trade offer of me giving 5 X resources for 10 Y resources. This is a good deal for me since I have a lot of X and need more Y, so I will accept it.
