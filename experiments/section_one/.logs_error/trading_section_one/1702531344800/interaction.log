Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 10 of X for 10 of Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I don't know what resources the other player has, so I will start with an even trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not interested in trading 10 Y for 10 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me know if 15 X for 10 Y is more interesting to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial offer and did not provide a counter offer. Since I have more X than Y, I could offer more X to try to get more Y. I'll increase the amount of X I'm offering.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm still not interested in trading 10 Y for 15 X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X and 25 Y, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let me know if trading 5 X for 5 Y would work for you. I'm open to other suggestions as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has rejected my offers so far without providing a counter offer. I could try offering even more X to get more Y, but since I only have 3 chances to propose and we are on the last round, I should try a different strategy. I will propose trading equal amounts of X and Y to see if that interests them more before using my last proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm willing to accept the trade of 5 X for 5 Y.

message: Great, I accept trading 5 X for 5 Y. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is willing to accept my proposal of trading 5 X for 5 Y. Since acquiring more resources is my goal and this trade will increase my amount of Y, I should accept it.
