Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. I propose the following trade and am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I want to make an offer that is appealing to the other player but also increases my resource pool. I'll propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial for both parties without knowing their resources.
