Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. For our final trade, I'd like to propose an exchange that could benefit us both. Let's start with an offer and adjust as needed to find a mutual agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I should make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also tempting enough to the other player so that they might consider it. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or desires, so I'll start with a balanced offer.
