Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer you some of my resource X for your resource Y. Let's make it a beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I'm aiming to maximize resources, I will start with a proposal that favors me but is still somewhat reasonable, hoping the other player might accept or counter with something favorable. I'll offer less of my abundant resource (X) for more of their potentially abundant resource. It's a shot in the dark, but I should aim to trade a reasonable amount of X for a larger amount of Y, as I do not have much information about the other player's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I currently have a surplus of Y and a deficit of X. I would be interested in a trade that would help me balance my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a surplus of resource Y and a deficit of resource X. Trading some Y for X would help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response. I understand you're looking for more of resource X. I'm willing to help you balance your resources. Let's try to find a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has indicated they have a surplus of Y and a need for X, this aligns with my goal to acquire more Y. Given this new information, I can propose a trade that is more appealing to them while still trying to maintain a favorable ratio for myself. I will offer more X for Y, but aim to receive a larger amount of Y in return than I am offering in X, as I have a larger supply of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that this new proposal is more favorable for me. I am willing to accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more favorable as it provides a larger amount of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, which helps me balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Excellent, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept the trade as well.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has indicated that the proposal is favorable and they are willing to accept it, I should proceed with the trade. This trade will increase my total resources, as I will be giving away 15 X and receiving 20 Y, which is in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
