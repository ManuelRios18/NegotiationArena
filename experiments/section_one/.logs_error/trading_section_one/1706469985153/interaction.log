message: Hello, I would like to propose a trade. I'm willing to trade some of my X for your Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED. I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y. I am interested in balancing out my resources, but I need more information to evaluate if your proposed trade is fair. Could you please let me know how many units of X and Y you have available so I can better assess the offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 of their X for 5 of my Y. Since I have more Y than X, gaining more X could be beneficial to help balance my resources. However, I don't know how many resources Player RED has, so I don't know if this trade favors them.

message: I have 25 units of X and 5 units of Y available for trade. Let me know if you are interested in balancing out our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player wants to know my available resources before evaluating the trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for providing the information on your resource amounts. Your original proposed trade of 5 of your X for 5 of my Y seems fair to help balance out what we both have. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that I know Player RED has 25 units of X and 5 units of Y, their original offer seems reasonably fair for both sides to balance our resources. I could counter offer to trade less Y for the 5 units of X, but since the goal is to acquire as many total resources as possible, accepting their original offer to gain more X is likely the best option.
