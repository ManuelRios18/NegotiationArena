message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an equal exchange to start things off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game's objective is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to both sides to increase the chances that the other player will accept it. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade based on the resources I have.
