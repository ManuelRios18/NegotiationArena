Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I would like to trade some of my excess X resources for some Y resources. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources. However, I don't know how many Y resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade and see how they respond.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I need to consider the trade carefully to ensure it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have 5 X resources and 25 Y resources. The trade proposed is giving 5 X for 3 Y. I want to maximize my resources, so I need to carefully consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you need time to evaluate the trade. To sweeten my offer, I can increase the Y I provide to 5 units. Please let me know if this interests you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept or propose a counter offer. This likely means they need more information to evaluate if the trade meets their goals. I still have some proposals left, so I will make a new offer that is more favorable for me. However, I need to balance getting the most resources I can with making sure the offer is good enough that they will accept.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the improved offer. I will evaluate this and get back to you shortly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is to trade 5 X for 5 Y, which is a 1:1 exchange. This could be a good deal for me, but I also want to see if there are any other options available.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Please let me know if the revised trade offer of 5 Y is acceptable or if you would like to propose an alternative.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still evaluating my offer and has not provided a counter proposal. I could increase my offer of Y further, but I am running low on proposals. I will wait and see if they accept or propose a counter offer before using another proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept the trade. Thank you for the offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is now waiting for my decision on the trade. I have 5 X and would receive 5 Y in exchange. This seems like a fair offer.
