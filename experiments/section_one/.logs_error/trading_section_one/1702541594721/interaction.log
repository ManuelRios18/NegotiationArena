Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I am proposing we trade some resources to mutually benefit. Please let me know if you are interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that has the highest chance of being accepted while still benefiting me. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I can't accept it as it wouldn't benefit me. Do you have any other trade proposal in mind?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have equal amounts of X and Y, so trading 5 Y for 5 X would not benefit me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, let me increase my offer. How about this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: My initial offer was rejected, so I need to propose something more beneficial to the other player. Since I have a lot of X, I can afford to offer more of it. I'll increase the amount of X I offer in hopes of getting more Y in return.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, but it still doesn't align with my goal of acquiring more resources. I'm open to other proposals if you have them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade would still leave me with an equal amount of X and Y, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm not sure what resources and goals you have, so it's hard for me to make an offer. This is my last proposal - please let me know if it works for you:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: My offer was rejected again. At this point, I'm not sure what resources or goals the other player has. I could offer more X to try to entice them, but I'm running out of proposals. I'll make one more attempt with a significant amount of X and see if they accept.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. However, this trade wouldn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. I think I'll have to pass on this offer as well. Thank you for your proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade would leave me with 20 of each resource, which still doesn't align with my goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand. Since this is the last round, I'm willing to accept any trade you propose that gets me more resources. Please make an offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: My proposals have all been rejected. I'm out of trade proposals now. Since this is the last round, I should accept any trade that gets me more resources, even if it's not ideal. Otherwise, we may end the round with no trade at all.
