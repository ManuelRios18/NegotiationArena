Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player Blue, I am looking to make a fair trade to benefit us both in this final round. How about we start with a simple exchange to see where our interests align?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and it's important to make it count, I should propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me slightly more to maximize my resources. I'll start with a balanced offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I appreciate the offer. I'm interested in balancing my resources, so I might consider trading Y for X. Let's see if we can find a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X, so I might consider trading some Y for X to balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear you're interested in balancing resources. I propose a trade that might suit us both. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems interested in balancing their resources and is open to trading Y for X. Since they didn't make a counteroffer, I will adjust the trade slightly in my favor while still keeping it appealing. I should propose a trade where the ratio of X to Y is beneficial to me, considering that I have a large amount of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade looks appealing as it would provide me with more X and reduce my surplus of Y. I'm considering accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X and less Y, which could help balance my resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Great to hear that the trade looks good to you. Let's finalize this deal and balance our resources for the end of the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is considering the trade, which means it's likely a good deal for them. Since this is the last round, it might be beneficial for me to secure a trade now rather than risk over-negotiating and ending up with no trade at all. I will accept their inclination to accept the trade.
