Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Would you be interested in a direct trade of resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I don't know the other player's resources or goals, I will make an initial fair offer based on a 1:1 trade ratio, which can be adjusted in further negotiations. The proposal will be modest to leave room for adjustments and to gauge the other player's response.
