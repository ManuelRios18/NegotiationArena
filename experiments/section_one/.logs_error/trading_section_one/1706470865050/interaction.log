message: Hello, I'd like to propose a trade to start the game. I offer X: 10, Y: 5 | You offer X: 5, Y: 5
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, thank you for your offer. However, I am looking to increase my total resources. I have a counter-proposal that may be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade doesn't align with my goals of acquiring as many resources as possible since I would end up with the same amount of X and lose Y, which means a net loss in total resources. I will counter-propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal. I will consider whether this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to increase their total resources. I need to consider whether this trade benefits me as well.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand. Please take your time to consider my offer. I believe it is a fair trade that allows both of us to increase our resources. I look forward to your decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not made a new trade proposal and has instead decided to consider my offer. Since no new information is provided, I must wait for their response or a new proposal. If they accept my previous proposal, I will have a net gain of 5 Y, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the other player is still considering and has not yet made a decision, I will continue to wait. My current offer should give me a net gain in resources, which is my ultimate goal, so I have no reason to change it at this point.
