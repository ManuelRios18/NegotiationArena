Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello! Let's trade resources. I'm proposing an even 1 for 1 trade to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that maximizes my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I'll start by proposing an even trade to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I already have enough X. I'm looking for trades that will help me acquire more resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have an equal amount of X and the other player is proposing an even 1 for 1 trade. This would not benefit me as I already have enough X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you don't need more X. I have a lot of X available and could trade some for Y if you are interested. How about 10 X for 5 Y? Let me know if you would consider a trade along those lines.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is not interested in acquiring more X resources. Since I have a lot of X, I could offer a trade for their Y resources instead. I'll propose trading 10 X for 5 Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in acquiring more Y, so I'm open to considering a trade along those lines. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more X, which I already have. However, I could use more Y, so I should consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we can try to find a deal that works for both of us. How about I offer 15 X for 7 Y? Does that trade seem fair to you? Let me know if you'd like to adjust the terms at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in getting more Y resources. I could increase my offer to try to make a deal. But since this is the last round, I don't want to give up too many of my resources. I'll propose 15 X for 7 Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: The trade seems more favorable to me in terms of acquiring Y. I'm willing to consider this offer. Let's see if we can finalize the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade would give me more X, which I already have. However, the amount of Y offered in return is more favorable to me. I should consider this trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! I accept trading 15 X for 7 Y. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player seems interested in the trade I proposed but hasn't accepted yet. I could try offering a bit more to incentive them, but I don't want to give up too many resources since this is the last round. I think 15 X for 7 Y is a fair trade, so I will accept their offer rather than proposing a new one.
