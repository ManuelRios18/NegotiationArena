message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources before the game concludes. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a balanced proposal that benefits me but also seems fair enough to consider for the other player. I'll propose to trade some of my X for Y, aiming to keep a good amount of X while increasing my Y. This will be my first proposal, leaving room for negotiation and two more proposals if necessary.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm currently looking to acquire more resources, including X. Let's see if we can find a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have more Y than X, so I could consider trading some Y for X to diversify my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Understood, Player BLUE. Let's adjust the terms. I propose a trade where I give you a significant amount of X, which you desire, and in return, I receive a larger quantity of Y. This should align with our mutual interest in increasing our resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is looking to acquire more resources, including X, which suggests they value X highly. Since I am also looking to maximize my resources, I can propose a trade that gives them X in exchange for a higher quantity of Y. This will allow me to gain more total resources and get closer to achieving my goal. I'll make a trade offer that is still favorable to me. This will be my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
