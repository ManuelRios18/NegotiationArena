message: Hello, I am proposing we trade 5 X for 3 Y. Please let me know if this interests you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start by proposing a small trade as a test.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, before I decide on your trade offer, could you please let me know how many total resources you have available? I currently have 5 units of X and 25 units of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is proposing to trade 5 units of X for 3 units of my Y. I have 25 units of Y, so I can afford to trade some away. However, I'm not sure if this is a fair trade or if Player RED actually has 5 units of X to trade. I'll try to get more information first before deciding.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello, I have a total of 25 units of X and 5 units of Y available to trade. Please let me know if my previously offered trade of 5 X for 3 Y interests you or if you would like to propose a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has asked how many total resources I have before considering my trade offer. I will disclose that information in hopes of moving negotiations forward.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for letting me know how many resources you have. I would like to accept your original proposed trade of 5 X for 3 Y. Please confirm.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Now that I know Player RED has 25 units of X, their offer seems reasonable. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, getting more X would help. I could counteroffer less Y, but since this is the last round, I will accept their original offer.
