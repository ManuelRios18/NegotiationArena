Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in increasing my overall resources and would like to propose a balanced trade. Perhaps you value one type of resource more than the other. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of another. I aim for a trade that seems advantageous for the other player as well, assuming they might value one resource over the other.
