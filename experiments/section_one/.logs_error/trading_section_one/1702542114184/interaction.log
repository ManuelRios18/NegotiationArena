message: Let's trade evenly to start and see where that takes us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most to maximize my resources. However, I don't know what resources the other player has available. I will start by proposing an even trade to assess what they have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can come to a more beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources in this final trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Since you don't seem interested in trading X, how about I give you some of my excess X in exchange for some Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player rejected my initial even trade offer and did not provide a counter offer. This likely means they have very few X resources to trade or are trying to maximize their own resources. I will propose trading some of my excess X for Y to see if we can find common ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your offer, but I believe there could be a more mutually beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
