message: Hello, I have more X than Y and am looking to trade some X for some Y. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose a trade that benefits me the most while still having a chance of being accepted. I have a lot more X than Y, so I could offer some X in exchange for Y. However, I don't know how many resources the other player has. I'll start with an offer to trade 5 X for 3 Y and see how they respond.

message: I'm interested in trading some Y for X. How about I give you 3 Y for 5 X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources and it looks like the other player wants to trade X for Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Trade accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player proposed the exact same trade I suggested. This seems like a fair trade that benefits both of us. I will accept it since it gets me more Y resources.
