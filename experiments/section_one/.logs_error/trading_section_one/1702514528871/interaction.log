message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I am willing to offer some of my resources for yours. Let's start with a balanced proposal and see where we can take it from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that is favorable yet plausible. I do not know Player BLUE's resources, so I should make an initial offer that is balanced, showing willingness to trade but also opening the door for negotiation.
