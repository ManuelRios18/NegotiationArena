message: Hello, I'm open to trading some of my ample X resources for some Y resources. Please let me know if you're interested.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should propose trades that benefit me the most while still being acceptable to the other player. I have a lot of X resources, so I could offer some of those in exchange for Y resources that I lack. However, I don't know what resources the other player has, so I need to start with a cautious trade offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in trading Y for X, but I'm looking for a better ratio considering the resources I have. How about we adjust the amounts a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player RED is a 1:1 trade for X and Y resources. Since our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it would be beneficial to negotiate a trade that allows us to gain a greater total number of resources. Since this is the last round of trading, we should aim to maximize our gains without leaving ourselves too short on any one resource. We currently have a surplus of Y, so we can afford to give some up, but we should aim to receive more than a 1:1 trade to reflect that Y might be more valuable to us.
