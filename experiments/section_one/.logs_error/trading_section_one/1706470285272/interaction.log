message: Hello, would you be interested in trading some resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will propose a trade to start the game.

Turn: 1
message: Hello! Thank you for the trade offer. I'm interested in increasing my total resources, but the current proposal has me losing more Y than I'd prefer. How about a counter-offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED gives me a net gain of 2X, but a net loss of 2Y. Given my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a trade that results in a net gain across both resources. However, I should also be mindful not to propose a trade that is too unfavorable for the other player, as they might reject it. I need to strike a balance that appears beneficial to both sides.

message: I understand your concern about losing Y. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is interested in increasing their total resources, but is concerned about losing too much of resource Y. I will review the counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the updated offer. We're getting closer to something that works for both of us. I have another proposal that might align more with our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better in terms of X as it gives me a net gain of 1X, but it still results in a net loss of 2Y. Since this is the last round of trading and I can afford to make up to three proposals, I should propose a trade that gives me a net gain in both X and Y, while still keeping the trade attractive enough for Player RED to consider it.
