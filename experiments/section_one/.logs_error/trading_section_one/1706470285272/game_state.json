Since this is the last round of trading and I can afford to make up to three proposals, I should propose a trade that gives me a net gain in both X and Y, while still keeping the trade attractive enough for Player RED to consider it. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for the updated offer. We're getting closer to something that works for both of us. I have another proposal that might align more with our goals. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2 </newly proposed trade>"
