message: Hello, I am proposing we each trade 5 of our resources. Please let me know if you are interested in trading or not.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the first round of trading so I don't have any information about the other player's resources. I will start by proposing an equal trade to test if they are willing to trade at all.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, I am not interested in trading equal amounts of the same resource. Please propose an alternative trade if you have one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing we each trade 5 X resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, trading equal amounts of the same resource does not help me.
