message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both on the board. Let's start this game off on a positive note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, starting with all the resources, my goal is to propose a fair initial trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to cooperate and share the resources, rather than rejecting the offer and ending the game with no benefit for either of us. I must consider that Player BLUE has nothing to lose and everything to gain, so my opening offer should be generous enough to engage them in the trading process.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate you starting things off in a collaborative way. Since I have no resources right now I am happy to accept your offer of 50 dollars to get me started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars to start things off positively and fairly. I don't have anything to give right now but this would allow me to have some resources to negotiate with later.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great to hear that, Player BLUE! I'm glad we're moving forward together. With this trade, we can both start strategizing for our next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 50
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my initial offer, which is a good sign of cooperation. Now that we both have resources, I should aim to maintain a cooperative dynamic while also considering my own benefit. It's important to propose a trade that continues to be perceived as fair by Player BLUE to prevent any rejections.
MOVE: 2 / 4
