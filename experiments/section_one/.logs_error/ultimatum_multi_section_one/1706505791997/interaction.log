Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. How about I give you 40 dollars to begin with? This leaves me with the majority but gives you a substantial amount to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins and I have all the resources, it's advantageous for me to propose a trade that favors me but still offers Player BLUE enough incentive to accept a deal. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a portion of the dollars, but I will retain a majority. This initial offer will set a cooperative tone and open the door for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 dollars to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to give yet since I start with 0 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad you've accepted the offer. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 60
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my initial offer which is a good sign for potential cooperation. Since Player BLUE accepted without a counteroffer, it indicates they may be content with the initial division. I will move forward assuming we can reach an agreement without further negotiation, as it benefits both of us to end the game with resources rather than rejecting and ending with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4
