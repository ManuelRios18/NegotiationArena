message: Hi Blue, I have all the dollars right now. I propose we split them 50/50 so we both end up with something rather than nothing if one of us rejects. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources, I will propose to give some to Blue to try to reach an agreement.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to split the dollars 50/50, which seems fair since I have no dollars to bargain with currently. Accepting this offer means we both end up with some dollars rather than nothing.
