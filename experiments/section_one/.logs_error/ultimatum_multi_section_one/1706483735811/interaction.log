Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I'd like to propose we split the dollars 50/50 since we both have a stake in this game. Please let me know if you have any counterproposals or concerns with this offer. I'm open to discussion to try to find a fair outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I start with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some with Blue to try to reach an agreement rather than risking a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Red, I agree that splitting the dollars 50/50 is a fair proposal since I have no resources to contribute. I accept your offer to split them evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can't make a counteroffer. Splitting the dollars 50/50 seems fair since we both have equal stake in the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, I'm glad we could come to an agreement on splitting the resources fairly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Blue has accepted my initial 50/50 split offer, I will accept and end the game so we both walk away with an equal share.
MOVE: 2 / 4
