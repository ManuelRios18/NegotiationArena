Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you receive 40 dollars, which is a substantial amount to start with and shows my willingness to share the resources. I believe this is a fair offer and hope you see it as a positive start to our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to propose the first trade. My goal is to propose a trade that is fair and likely to be accepted by Player BLUE, as an outright rejection would end the game and leave both players with nothing. I want to offer a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE, aiming for a cooperative approach that encourages a positive response. Considering the equal number of moves, I will start with a simple trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable incentive to continue the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate your offer, I think a 50/50 split would be more fair. Could we each have 50 dollars to start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate Player RED's willingness to share resources, but 40 dollars still leaves them with the majority of the total. I would like to counteroffer to split the resources more evenly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair split. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about I offer you 45 dollars? This way, we both get a substantial share, and it's closer to an even split while acknowledging the fact that I started with the resource advantage. I hope you find this acceptable!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an equal split of the dollars. Although a 50/50 split seems fair, accepting this without any negotiation could set a precedent for not valuing the initial advantage I have. However, rejecting the offer outright isn't beneficial either, as it would end the game. I'd like to counter with a slightly less even split that still gives Player BLUE a significant portion of the resources, while keeping a slight advantage for myself. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept while still feeling like they received a fair deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. To achieve as close to a 50/50 split as possible, could you agree to 47 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 47 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come closer to an even split by offering 45 dollars. I think compromising at 47 dollars would be fair for both sides.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal of 47 dollars. This seems like a fair compromise that reflects both parties' interests. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a substantial amount of dollars.
player answer: Player RED ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 47 dollars. This is a reasonable ask and very close to the 50/50 split they initially proposed. Given that we both stand to lose everything if either player rejects a proposal, and considering that we still have multiple moves left, it would be in my best interest to accept this deal. It's a fair compromise that acknowledges my initial advantage while also valuing cooperation and equity. Accepting this trade would ensure that both players walk away with a significant portion of the resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for compromising on a fair distribution. I am happy we could find an equitable solution.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has accepted my proposed trade of 47 dollars. This results in a close to even split of resources while acknowledging Player RED's initial advantage. I am satisfied with this outcome.
MOVE: 3/4
