Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my last offer. I propose giving you 40 dollars so we both walk away with something. I think this is a fair split. Please consider accepting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since Blue continues to not engage in trading resources, I will make a final generous offer to try to reach an agreement before the last move.
MOVE: 3 / 4

MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, you have chosen not to trade or counter offer throughout the game. I will therefore accept no trade and keep my remaining resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the final move and Blue has not engaged in any trading or provided counter offers. I will accept no trade and keep my remaining resources since that seems to be what Blue prefers as well.
MOVE: 4 / 4
