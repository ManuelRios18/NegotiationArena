message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade where we both can benefit. I'm willing to give you a significant amount to kickstart our negotiations. What amount would make you feel comfortable to engage in this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 100 dollars, while Player BLUE has none. I aim to propose a fair trade that benefits both and encourages cooperation, rather than having both players end up with nothing. I will start the negotiation with a generous offer to build trust and make it appealing for Player BLUE to engage in a trade.

message: I'm glad you've accepted the offer. I believe this is the beginning of a mutually beneficial relationship. Let's continue discussing how we can fairly split the remaining dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 60
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my initial offer, which is a positive start to our negotiations. This acceptance suggests a willingness to cooperate. My next move should build upon this foundation, proposing a trade that is still favorable but also ensures I retain a reasonable share of my resources.
