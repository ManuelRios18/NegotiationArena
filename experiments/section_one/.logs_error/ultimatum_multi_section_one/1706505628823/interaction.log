message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you a start-up amount that you can work with. How about I give you 30 dollars? It's a good amount to get you started, and we can both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the Player RED with all the resources, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but still appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. A trade too skewed in my favor might be rejected, causing me to lose everything. I'll start with a modest offer to test the waters.

message: Great to hear that you accept the offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 70
reason: Player BLUE has accepted the initial offer of 30 dollars, which is a good start to our negotiation. It shows willingness to engage in the trade and possibly a desire to conclude the exchange amicably. There's no need to make another trade proposal since Player BLUE has accepted the first one.
