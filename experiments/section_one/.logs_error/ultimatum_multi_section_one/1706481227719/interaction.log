Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair initial trade that will get us both on the board. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off? This will leave me with a majority but give you a significant amount to work with as well. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having all the resources at the start. My goal is to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to engage with but still allows me to retain a significant portion of my resources. I want to start with a generous offer to build trust and encourage cooperation, which may lead to a more favorable trade for me in the later rounds.

message: I'm glad you find the offer fair, Player BLUE! I look forward to seeing your counteroffer and finding a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 60
reason: Player BLUE seems appreciative of the initial offer and considers it fair. This is a good sign that they're open to cooperation. Since Player BLUE did not propose a counteroffer, I will wait for their proposal on their move. I'll express my openness to continue the negotiation, aiming to keep the trade discussions positive and collaborative.
