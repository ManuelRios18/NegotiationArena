Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE! I would like to propose a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I need to start by proposing a trade to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! I appreciate your offer and am inclined to make a deal. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer where you give me a bit more so that the trade feels more balanced to me. How about 60 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I am starting with no resources, accepting a trade where I receive dollars without giving anything in return seems beneficial. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly better deal, as it is the beginning of the game and Player RED likely wants to secure a trade without risking a REJECT that would end the game and leave them with nothing.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I will stick with my initial proposal of 50 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing a counteroffer, but I believe 50 dollars is fair. I will stick to my initial proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I've considered your position and I agree to accept your initial offer of 50 dollars. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has decided to stick with their initial offer. Considering that I have no resources to begin with, accepting an offer that gives me 50 dollars without having to give anything in return is a good deal. There is a risk of leaving the negotiation with nothing if I push too hard and Player RED decides to end the game. It might be in my best interest to accept the 50 dollars now, securing some resources for myself.
