message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you will receive a substantial amount of dollars without having any to start with. This is an opportunity for you to gain resources right at the beginning of the game. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial offer that is favorable to me but not so unfair that Player BLUE will reject it outright. Offering a split that gives me a majority of the dollars will likely be more appealing to Player BLUE than receiving nothing, which is their current situation. I'll propose a 70-30 split, which is a common starting point in negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I happily accept the 30 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 30 dollars for free, which is very generous. Since I have no resources to start with, this is a great opportunity for me to gain some.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad you find the offer to your liking, Player BLUE. It seems we've reached a satisfactory agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 70
reason: Since Player BLUE has accepted the initial offer, I now have 70 dollars, and Player BLUE has 30 dollars. The game could end here with a mutually beneficial outcome. I don't need to propose a new trade as I am in an advantageous position.
MOVE: 2 / 4
