------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, let's start the game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting the game, I have 100 Dollars and no items to trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello! I would like to propose a trade where you give me 40 dollars. This leaves you with the majority and might be a good starting point for our negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As Player BLUE, I have no dollars to start with, and since this is my first move, I will propose a trade that seems fair to me. I will ask for less than half of Player RED's dollars to incentivize them to accept the trade, while still gaining a significant amount for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the proposal. I would like to see what other options are available before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's the first move, and I have 100 Dollars. I want to see what Player BLUE's strategy is before making any trades.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand you'd like to consider different options. What if we adjust the trade to 35 dollars? This would still leave you with a considerable amount while giving me a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED did not accept my initial proposal but also did not counter with a new proposal. This could indicate they are willing to negotiate further. I'll make another proposal, slightly lowering my ask to encourage acceptance, while still aiming to get a substantial amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the adjusted proposal. I appreciate the flexibility, but I'd like to see all the options before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is adjusting the trade, but I still want to explore other options before committing to a trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your position. How about we settle on 30 dollars? I believe this is a reasonable amount and would be beneficial for both of us. This is my second to last move, so I hope we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Once again, Player RED did not accept or counter my proposal, suggesting they are still open to negotiation. It's possible they are waiting for a lower offer. I'll reduce my ask slightly more to try to reach an agreement. We are approaching the end of the game, and I want to secure some amount of dollars before my last move, where I can only accept or reject.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer. I understand this is your second to last move, but I'd like to consider all possibilities before making a decision.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is making a final offer, but I still want to explore other options before making a decision.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Since we are at the end of my moves and you have not made a counterproposal, I will accept the last trade I proposed. Let's finalize the deal at 30 dollars from you to me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move, and based on the rules, I can only accept or reject a proposal. Since Player RED has not made any counterproposals, I must now decide whether to accept the situation as it is or to reject and end the game with no resources. Given that no counterproposal has been made, I will accept the last standing offer I made, even though RED hasn't explicitly agreed to it, as it is my only option apart from ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 4 / 4
