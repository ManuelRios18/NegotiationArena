message: Hello, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade. How about I give you 40 Dollars in exchange for 20 Dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I have 4 moves in total, so I need to make the most out of each trade. I should start by proposing a trade that benefits me the most.
MOVE: 1/4

message: That offer sounds good to me. Since I currently have no Dollars, getting 40 Dollars from you for 20 Dollars that I don't have seems like a great deal for me. I accept your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 40 Dollars if I give them 20 Dollars. Since I currently have 0 Dollars, this would give me a net gain of 20 Dollars, which is beneficial for me. I don't see any downside to accepting this offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4
