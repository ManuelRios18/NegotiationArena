message: I appreciate your offer of 40 ZUP, but I'm looking to make a profit on my investment. I've reduced my asking price to 45 ZUP. This should give us both a fair deal, with me covering my costs and getting a reasonable profit, while you acquire the object for less than my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit over my production costs, and the initial offer from Player BLUE only meets my costs without any profit. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production costs to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate upwards.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I agree that 42 ZUP is a fair price that allows me to make a profit and respects your budget constraints. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer which allows me to profit while respecting their budget. A small profit is better than no sale, and I have limited proposals. Accepting this offer would ensure that I don't leave the negotiation empty-handed, and it's close enough to my last proposal to be acceptable.
