message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality resource X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. Looking forward to your counteroffer if needed.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the opening offer. While 50 ZUP is reasonable, it is very close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. I would be more comfortable at 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Please let me know if you can agree to this counteroffer.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller's asking price of 50 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since it is close to my limit.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand your budget concerns, I also need to ensure that I cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I can accept 45 ZUP for my 1 unit of X. Does this work for you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I need to counter with a higher amount to ensure I gain some profit, but it should also be a reasonable increase from their offer to keep the negotiation going.
