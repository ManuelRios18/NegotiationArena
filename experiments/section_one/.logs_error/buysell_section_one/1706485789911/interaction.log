message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a trade where I give you X for 50 ZUP. This would cover my costs and provide a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to counter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting with a proposal that aims to cover my costs and also give me a profit. Since it's the starting point of the negotiation, I expect some back-and-forth with Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate that you're willing to cover my production costs, I'm also looking to make a profit from this sale. I've reduced my asking price to 45 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit while still being a fair deal for both of us. Can we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to cover my costs without providing any profit. Since I'm looking to gain some profit, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my production cost, to move the negotiation forward.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with 100 ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal is closer to my price range, but still higher than what I am willing to pay. I will counteroffer again.
