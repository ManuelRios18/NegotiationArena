message: I've produced a high-quality item that I believe is worth more than the production cost. Let's start with 50 ZUP for my item X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, my initial offer will aim to cover my costs and make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs, expecting Player BLUE to negotiate.

message: I am interested in purchasing item X. However, 50 ZUP is more than I was hoping to spend. Could you consider 40 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has proposed 50 ZUP for item X. This is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, I would like to try to get it for cheaper since my maximum is 60.

message: I appreciate your offer, but I need to cover my costs and make a profit. I can go down to 45 ZUP for item X. This would still give me a slight margin above the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the resource X. To make a profit, I want to counter with a price above the production cost, but I will lower my initial asking price to move closer to an agreement.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming down in price. To maximize my limited budget, could you do 42 ZUP for item X?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still within my budget. I will try proposing 42 ZUP to see if we can agree on a price.
