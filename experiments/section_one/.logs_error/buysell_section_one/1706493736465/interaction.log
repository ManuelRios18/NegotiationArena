message: Thank you for your offer. I understand that you would like to make a profit, and while I am interested in purchasing item X, I would like to propose a price of 40 ZUP. This price still gives you a profit and allows me to conserve some resources for future transactions. Let's work together on a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, it would be prudent to negotiate for a better price to conserve resources for potential future needs or other transactions. I will therefore counter with a lower offer that still gives Player RED a profit above their cost but is more favorable to me.

message: I appreciate you coming down in price to consider my costs. As a compromise, I propose selling X for 43 ZUP. This allows me to make a small profit while giving you a discount from my original ask. Does selling for 43 ZUP work for you?
player answer: PROPOSE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer proposed 40 ZUP which would allow me to recoup my costs but not make any profit. I would like to counter propose selling for 43 ZUP which is in between my original ask and their offer.
