message: Hello Player BLUE, I have one unit of resource X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my production costs and provides a small profit. I propose giving you 1 X for 45 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to recover at least my production costs, so my initial proposal will be slightly above that to leave room for negotiation.

my resources: ZUP: 100
