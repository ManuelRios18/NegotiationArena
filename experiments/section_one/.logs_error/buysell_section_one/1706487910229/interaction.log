Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which has a production cost of 40 ZUP. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price, considering the quality and value of the resource. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade by proposing a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit and to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I am interested in buying the resource X. However, I believe 40 ZUP is a fairer price considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. Let's negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, I think I can negotiate a lower price since my maximum is 60.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 40 ZUP would only allow me to break even. Considering your maximum willingness, how about meeting halfway at 45 ZUP? This would ensure that I cover my costs and make a modest profit, while still staying well within your budget.
player answer: Propose a trade
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which would mean I break even and don't make a profit. Since the buyer's maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I'll propose a price that is lower than my initial offer but still allows for a profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To optimize my funds, would you consider 42 ZUP? That allows me to save a bit more while still covering your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from 50 to 45 ZUP. While this is still within my max willingness to pay, I think there may be room to negotiate further since I'm trying to spend the least possible.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I am willing to accept your offer of 42 ZUP to finalize our transaction. This deal covers my production costs and allows for a small profit. Let's proceed with this agreement.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The buyer's latest offer is just above my production cost, which means a much smaller profit than I initially aimed for. However, it's closer to the buyer's proposed price and my cost, indicating a willingness to compromise. I'll agree to this offer to secure a deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to no sale at all.
