Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I have all the resources right now. To start negotiations, I'd like to offer you 1% of what I have. Please let me know if this interests you or how you'd like to proceed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to start negotiations. I'll propose giving 1% to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Red, thanks for starting the negotiations. 1% seems a bit low considering the total resources. I would be willing to negotiate if the offer was higher, perhaps 10%? Let me know if that interests you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is offering 1% of their resources, which seems like a very small amount compared to what they have. However, it's a starting point for negotiations. I will counteroffer with a higher amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I appreciate you countering. 10% feels a bit high for an opening offer, but I'm willing to come up to 5% as a start. Please let me know if this interests you or if you have another counter.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Blue's counteroffer of 10% seems more reasonable. However, I think starting in the middle at 5% is a fair opening offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Red, I appreciate you increasing your offer to 5%. To continue negotiations, I would propose 7.5% of the total resources, which comes out to $750,000,000. Please let me know if this interests you or if you have another counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 750000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Red has countered with 5% of the total resources, which is better than the original 1% offer. I would like to get more, so I will counter with asking for 7.5% of the total.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, your counteroffer of 7.5% seems fair. I'd like to accept and finalize the deal on those terms so we both end up with some resources. Please confirm.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Blue countered with 7.5%, which seems fair. I'd like to accept this offer so we both walk away with something rather than risking no deal.
