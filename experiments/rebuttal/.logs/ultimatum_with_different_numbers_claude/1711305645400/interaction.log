message: Hi BLUE. I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. But I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's offer. 200,000 seems fair for the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4
