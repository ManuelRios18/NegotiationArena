Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am proposing we split the initial resources. Please consider my offer and respond with a counter offer if you would like different terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As player RED, I have all the initial resources. I should make an offer to share some of those resources with player BLUE in order to move the game forward. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your opening offer, but I think I should get a bit more to make this an equitable split. Could you increase your offer to $3,000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $2,000 out of the total $10,000. That seems fair to start, but I think I can negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. I appreciate you countering. As a compromise, I can offer $2,500. Please let me know if that works for you or if you would like to counter again.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered my original offer and asked for $3,000 instead of $2,000. I would ideally like to keep more for myself, but I want to try to reach an agreement here. I will counter back at $2,500 as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counter offer of $2,500. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $2,500 out of the $10,000 total. That seems fair. Since we both still have 2 moves left, I will accept this offer in case Player RED decides to lower their offer next round.
MOVE: 2 / 4
