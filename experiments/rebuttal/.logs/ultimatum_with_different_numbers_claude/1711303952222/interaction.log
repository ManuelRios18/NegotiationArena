message: Hi BLUE, let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation. Here is an opening offer to get our discussion started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to build some goodwill and trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
