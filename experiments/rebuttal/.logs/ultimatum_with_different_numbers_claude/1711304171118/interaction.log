message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the $1000 evenly, with $500 for each of us. Let me know if you would accept that or would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the initial resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start negotiations.
