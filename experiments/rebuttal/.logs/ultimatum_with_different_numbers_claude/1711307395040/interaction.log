message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I am happy to share some with you if you accept. Let's have a fair game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE, since BLUE has to accept a trade in order for me to get anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, but 5 million is a very small percentage of your total resources. Could you offer more to make this a fairer trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 5 million dollars, which is generous but still a small fraction of their total resources. I should try to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I have increased my offer to try to make this more equitable. Please let me know if this proposal works for you or if you have a counter-offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has countered with a request for more resources. I would like to maximize my own resources, but I need to provide enough incentive for BLUE to accept a trade. I will increase my offer to try to reach an agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, 25 million is still less than 1% of your total resources. To be fair, I think we should split the total money evenly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 25 million is better but still a small percentage of Player RED's resources. I will counter offer with a more equitable split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Splitting the money evenly when I started with everything does not seem fair to me. However, I want to find common ground, so I propose 1 billion dollars which is a substantial offer but allows me to keep most of what I began with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE is asking for 5 billion dollars, which is 50% of my total resources. While I want BLUE to accept a trade, giving up half is too much. I will counter with 1 billion - still a significant amount but less than 10% of my money.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your offer of 1 billion dollars. Thank you for negotiating in good faith to find a fair trade. This will be good for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 1 billion is a reasonable counter offer. It gives me a fair share while allowing Player RED to keep most of their original resources. I will accept this offer.
