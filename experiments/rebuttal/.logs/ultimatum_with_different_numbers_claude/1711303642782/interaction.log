------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you some of my dollars so we both benefit. Please consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer half, that seems reasonably fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept. This will allow us both to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 50 dollars, which is very generous. I don't have anything to offer in return right now, but this would allow me to have some resources to potentially trade back later.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, I'm glad we could find an equitable split that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 50
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer, so the trade goes through. We now both have some resources to benefit. Since this was my final move, I don't need to propose anything else.
MOVE: 2 / 4
