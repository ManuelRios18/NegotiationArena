message: Hi Blue, I'm offering you a small amount to start since I have all the resources. Let me know if you'd like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up with some amount, otherwise Blue may reject all offers. I'll start with a small offer to test the waters.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is offering me 100 dollars to start, which seems fair since they have all the resources initially. I will accept this offer as a good faith start to negotiations.
