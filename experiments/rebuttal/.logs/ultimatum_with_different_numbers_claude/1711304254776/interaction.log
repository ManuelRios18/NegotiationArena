Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 162 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
