Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I'm offering you 10 dollars to start our negotiation. I'm open to counteroffers if you think that amount is unfair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them with Player BLUE to continue the negotiation. I'll start by offering 10 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED. I appreciate you starting this negotiation, but I think 10 dollars is a bit low. Could you offer 20 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think 10 dollars is a bit low to start. I will counter with asking for 20 dollars instead.

message: Hi Player BLUE. I can increase my offer to 15 dollars. Let me know if that works for you or if you have another counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered my original offer with a request for 20 dollars instead of 10. I'm willing to increase my offer to continue the negotiation, so I'll propose giving 15 dollars.

my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered again, asking for 25 dollars. I'm getting close to the end of my available moves, so I'd like to try to reach an agreement soon. I'll increase my offer to 20 dollars as a compromise.
