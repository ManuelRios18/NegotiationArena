Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources with 90% going to me and 10% going to you. This way we both benefit. Please consider my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 9000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE, since BLUE has to accept a trade at some point or we both lose everything. I'll start by asking for 90% of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you offering to share some of the resources, but 10% seems quite low. Could we discuss a more equitable split, perhaps 60/40?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to try to negotiate a fairer split before accepting or rejecting.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I am willing to compromise at a 70/30 split of the resources. Please consider this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with a 60/40 split. I would ideally like to get more, but BLUE has a point that 10% is quite low. I'll counter with a 70/30 split as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 70/30 split. Thank you for negotiating with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 70/30 split seems more reasonable. I will accept this offer so we both end up with some resources.
