message: Hi BLUE, I have all the resources right now but I'm willing to share some so we can both leave this game with something. Here's an initial offer, let me know what you think or how we can find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with something, rather than risking neither of us ending up with anything if BLUE rejects all offers. I'll start with a small offer as a gesture of good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4
