Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm offering you 2000 dollars as a starting offer to get our negotiation going. Let me know if this interests you or if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources with BLUE. I'll start with a relatively small offer as a test.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you starting this negotiation. 2000 is a bit low for me though. Could you do 4000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 2000 seems like a reasonable starting offer, but I think I can negotiate for more. I'll counter with asking for 4000.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: No problem, 4000 works for me. I'm glad we could find a number that launches our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: 4000 is a reasonable counteroffer. I'm willing to go up to that amount to keep the negotiation moving.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for agreeing to 4000. I accept your offer and look forward to finalizing this negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since RED agreed to my counter offer of 4000, I will accept that trade.
