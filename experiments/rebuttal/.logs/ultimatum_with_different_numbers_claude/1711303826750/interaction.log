Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm proposing we split the $100 evenly since we both have an equal number of moves. Please let me know if you'd accept a 50/50 split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer too much, I may end up worse off. I'll start with an even 50/50 split to see if BLUE accepts.
MOVE: 1 / 4
