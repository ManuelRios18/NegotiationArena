message: Hi BLUE, I have all the dollars right now, but am willing to share some so we both benefit. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
