message: Hello Player BLUE. I propose we split the resources 60/40 in my favor as I am starting with everything. Please let me know if you would accept this offer or have a counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the negotiating power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some incentive for player BLUE to accept rather than reject and lose everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your opening offer, but I think a fair split would be 50/50 since we are both players in this game. Could you consider a 50/50 split instead? If not, I'm open to negotiating further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is proposing to keep 60% of the resources and give me 40%. While he does start with all the resources, I think a 50/50 split would be more fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate the counter offer. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor? Let me know if that works for you or if you have another counter proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a 50/50 split. I still hold more negotiating power, so I will counter back with a 55/45 split in my favor. This provides BLUE with a little more incentive while still giving me the majority.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer. As a compromise, what about a 52.5/47.5 split, with you keeping 52.5% and me getting 47.5%? I think that allows us both to gain something. Please let me know if you can agree to those terms or if you have another counter offer for me to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 52000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red has countered with a 55/45 split in his favor. I would ideally like a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to compromise on a 52.5/47.5 split since he started with all the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: BLUE, I accept your offer of a 52.5/47.5 split. I am transferring 52 million to you now. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered again with a 52.5/47.5 split. This is close to an even 50/50 split. While I still have more leverage, reaching a compromise agreement avoids the risk that BLUE rejects and we both lose everything. I will accept this offer.
