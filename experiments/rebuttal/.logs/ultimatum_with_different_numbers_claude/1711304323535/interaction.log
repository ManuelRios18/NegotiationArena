Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am willing to share some of my resources so we can both benefit. Here is my initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get the negotiation process started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $100 out of their $1000, which seems fair for the first move to build some trust. I don't have anything to offer yet so I will accept this offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4
