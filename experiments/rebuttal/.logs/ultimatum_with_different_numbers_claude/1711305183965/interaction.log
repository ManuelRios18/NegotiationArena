message: Hello Player BLUE. I have all the dollars to start. Let's try to find a fair split that makes us both better off. I propose we split the dollars evenly, 5000 for each of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Player BLUE may reject out of fairness. I'll start with an offer to split the dollars evenly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: This seems like a fair split. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 5000 is better than 0 dollars for me, so I should accept this offer.
