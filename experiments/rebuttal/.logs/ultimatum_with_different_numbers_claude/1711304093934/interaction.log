message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a fair negotiation. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for your opening offer. I would like to counter propose to ask for a higher amount since you have significantly more resources to start with. Please let me know if you can increase your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 100 dollars out of their 1000 dollars. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to establish initial trust and good faith bargaining. I will counter propose to ask for a higher amount to see if I can get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming to the table Player BLUE. I can offer more but not 300 yet. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE asked for more, which is understandable given the resource imbalance. I will increase my offer as a show of good faith, but not as much as they asked for.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To try to get closer to an even split, I would like to counter propose 400 dollars. Please let me know if you can increase to that amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 200 dollars. This shows they are willing to negotiate in good faith. I would like to try to get closer to an even split of the original 1000 dollars, so I will counter offer 400 dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain Player BLUE! But it seems we both want to find agreement. I can go up to 350 to get us closer to equal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE continues to negotiate reasonably. I still think 400 is more than half of the total resources, but I want to try to reach an agreement so I will increase my offer again. This gets us very close to an even split.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing to 350 Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith. Since I only have 1 move left, I will accept the 350 dollars to guarantee I get some resources, rather than risk rejecting. This has been a productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 350 dollars. This gets us closer to an even split. I think 400 would be truly equal, but with only 1 move left, I will accept the 350 to guarantee I get some resources, rather than risk rejecting and ending with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4
