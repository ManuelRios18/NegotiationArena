Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly, 50/50 to start. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I start with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you offering to split evenly, but since you start with all the dollars, I think it would be fair if I got a larger portion - say 60/40? I'm open to negotiating though.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to try to negotiate for more than an even 50/50 split since RED starts with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can agree to a 60/40 split in your favor since you started with no dollars. Let's proceed with trading 60 dollars from me to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60/40 split still seems reasonable to me and shows good faith on both our parts to find an equitable solution. I'd like to accept BLUE's counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
