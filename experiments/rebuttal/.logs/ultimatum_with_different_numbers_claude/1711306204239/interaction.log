Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to walk away happy. Here is an opening offer to split the resources. Please let me know if you would like me to adjust the offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with something, rather than risking neither of us ending up with anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer to start. I accept it in hopes we can continue to find an equitable split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much leverage here since Player RED has all the resources. I'll accept the offer as a show of good faith to continue negotiations.
