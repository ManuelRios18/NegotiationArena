newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them in order to continue negotiations. I'll start by offering a small portion to establish a baseline.
