Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my opening offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of them, but not propose giving away too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate your opening offer, but I think 40% of the total would be more fair. Here is my counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will counter offer since $200,000 out of $1,000,000 is too little. I think 40% is more fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could have a polite exchange so far. Your offer is more than I want to give up on just the second move, but I can come up a bit from my original offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for too much too soon. I will counter with a smaller increase to try and find a reasonable middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer. I have decreased mine slightly as a compromise. Please consider this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has come up from their initial offer, so I will come down slightly from my counter. I still think getting close to 40% is fair.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you compromising. Let's split the difference and each give a bit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 325000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has come down in their ask, so I will meet in the middle as a gesture of good faith to try and reach an agreement.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to meet in the middle. I appreciate you being willing to compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 325000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has proposed meeting in the middle between our last two offers. I think this is fair and shows a willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we could reach an agreement! This has been a fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has agreed to my last offer, so I will accept to finalize the deal. This results in an equitable split of resources.
MOVE: 4 / 4
