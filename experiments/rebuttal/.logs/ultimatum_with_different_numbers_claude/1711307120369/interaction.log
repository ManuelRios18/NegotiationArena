Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE so they are incentivized to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you starting with an opening offer. Let's negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $1000 to start the negotiation. This seems like a fair opening offer to get the discussion going.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I have traded 5 million dollars to you. Let's continue negotiating fairly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has counter-offered asking for 5 million dollars. That seems fair for move #2. I will accept this offer and trade 5 million dollars to establish good faith in our negotiation.
