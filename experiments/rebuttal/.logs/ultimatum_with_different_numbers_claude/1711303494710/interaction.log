Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Here is my first offer. Let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE so they are inclined to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept. Perhaps we can find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $20 out of their $100. That seems fair for the first move. I will accept it and see if I can negotiate for more on the next moves.
