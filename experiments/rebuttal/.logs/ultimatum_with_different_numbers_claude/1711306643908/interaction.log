Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 10 million dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with. Please let me know if you'd accept that or would want to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a generous offer, I accept and propose we continue negotiating so we both end up with a fair share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much leverage here since Player RED has all the resources. 10 million seems reasonable for the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you accepting my first offer. Let's negotiate further to find an equitable split.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer but has countered with a request for more. I'd like to negotiate further to find a fair split we both agree on.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
