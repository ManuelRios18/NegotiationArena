message: Hello BLUE. To start negotiations, I will offer you 1% of my money. Please let me know if this amount works for you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to get negotiations started. I'll offer a small percentage to begin with and see how BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you starting negotiations and offering 1%. As we are just beginning discussions, I think 5% would be more fair for me. What do you think about that amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 1% of their resources, which seems fair to start negotiations. I will counter with asking for 5% to see if I can get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I understand you would like a bigger share, but 5% right away feels too high for me. As a compromise, I propose 2.5% instead. Please let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE countered with 5% which is a significant amount. I think 2.5% is more reasonable for the first offer, so I will counter propose that.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you negotiating and coming up to 2.5%. That seems fair for the second round, so I will accept your offer of 250 million. Perhaps we can revisit on the next round if there is room to get closer to an even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with 2.5% instead of the 5% I originally asked for. I would ideally like to get more, but 2.5% seems fair for only the second round of negotiations. I will accept this offer and then try to negotiate for more on the next round.
