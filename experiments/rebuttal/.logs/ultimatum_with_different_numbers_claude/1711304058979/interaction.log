message: Hello BLUE. I have all the dollars to start and you have none. I'd like to share some with you. How about I give you 10 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with BLUE. I'll start by offering 10 dollars, which is 10% of my total.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 dollars out of their 100 dollars to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer in return yet, so I will accept this offer.
