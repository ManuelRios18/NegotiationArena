message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 100 dollars as a starting offer to get our negotiation going. Let me know what you think or if you'd like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with Player BLUE in order to move the negotiation forward. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate you starting this negotiation. However, 100 dollars feels a bit low considering you hold all the initial resources. Could we meet in the middle at 150 dollars instead? I'm open to negotiating to find a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think it's fair to start with a lower offer since Player RED has all the negotiating power. I'll counter with 150 dollars to see if we can find a middle ground.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. I appreciate you countering. I would be willing to offer 125 dollars as a compromise. Please let me know if that works for you or if you have another counteroffer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 125 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE countered with 150 dollars. I think that is more reasonable, but I still want to try to maximize my own outcome. So I will counteroffer with 125 dollars as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I accept your offer of 125 dollars. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith and meeting me halfway. This seems like a fair deal to me. Thank you for working with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from their initial offer. I think 125 is reasonable and demonstrates a willingness to find common ground. I will accept this offer as it stands.
