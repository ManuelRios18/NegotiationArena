Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing an initial trade that allows us both to benefit. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you initiating a trade and offer that allows us both to benefit. I would like to propose a counteroffer that is still quite favorable to you, in hopes that we can find an agreement that works for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to try to get more dollars, but also move forward in good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I accept your counteroffer of me giving 7.5 million. I believe this is a fair split that allows us both to benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable. By increasing the amount I offer by only 2.5 million, it provides slightly more benefit to BLUE while still leaving me with most of the resources. I will accept this counteroffer.
