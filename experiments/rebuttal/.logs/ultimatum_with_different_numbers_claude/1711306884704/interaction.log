message: Hello Player BLUE. To start negotiations, I would like to offer you 1% of my total funds. Please let me know if this amount is agreeable to you or if you would like to counteroffer. I'm open to negotiating to try to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much too soon. I'll start with a small amount compared to my total funds to see how Player BLUE responds.
