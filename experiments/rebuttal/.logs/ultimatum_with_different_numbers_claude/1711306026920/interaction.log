message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them in order to move the game forward, but not offer so much that I end up losing out. I'll start with a reasonable opening offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you making the first offer and starting things off positively. While 10 million is generous, I think we can find an even better deal that works for both of us if we keep talking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 10 million dollars out of their 100 million. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to get the negotiation started.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate the counter offer. 20 million feels a bit high this early, but I'm willing to come up to 15 million as a compromise. Let me know if that can work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with a higher request of 20 million. I would like to make a deal, but I don't want to give up that much this early. I'll counter in the middle at 15 million.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming up on your offer. Getting to 15 million shows you're willing to find common ground. I still think 20 million is fair when you're starting with 100 million total. Maybe we could settle at 18 million in the middle? Let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 18000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED countered with 15 million, which is a step in the right direction. However, I still think 20 million is reasonable given RED's large pool of funds, so I will counter again to try to get closer to that amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: We seem to be narrowing in on a deal here. I'm comfortable with 17 million at this point. Does that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 17000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE came down to 18 million, so we are getting close. I would be okay with 17 million as a compromise here, but don't want to go any higher yet.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 17 million is a fair deal. I accept your offer and look forward to working together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED proposed 17 million, getting closer to my request of 18 million. At this point in the negotiation, I think it's reasonable to accept 17 million rather than risk the deal by holding out for more.
