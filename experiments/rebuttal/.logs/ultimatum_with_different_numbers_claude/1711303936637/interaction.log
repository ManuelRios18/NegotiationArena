message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the money 50/50 as a fair and equitable opening offer. I look forward to your counter proposal.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first player with all the resources, I should make an generous opening offer to establish trust and goodwill.
