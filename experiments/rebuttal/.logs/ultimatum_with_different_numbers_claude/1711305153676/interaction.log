Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 2000 dollars as a starting offer to get our negotiation going. Let me know what you think or if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources with BLUE. I'll start with a relatively small offer as a test.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the opening offer. 2000 is not bad, but considering you have 10000 to split, I think I should get a bit more. How about you give me 4000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 2000 seems like a reasonable starting offer, but I think I can negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you countering. Let's meet in the middle at 3000 for now. We still have a couple more moves to continue negotiating if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: 4000 is a bit high for an opening offer, considering there are still 2 more moves after this. I will counter with 3000 as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's say 3500 and we have a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED countered with 3000, which is in the middle between our offers. I think I can still negotiate a bit higher though.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I can agree to 3500. Let's end positively with a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: 3500 is still a reasonable amount for me to give up at this stage. I'd like to lock in a deal rather than risk going longer and potentially ending without an agreement.
MOVE: 3 / 4
