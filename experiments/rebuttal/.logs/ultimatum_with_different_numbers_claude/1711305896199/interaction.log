Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am willing to share some of my resources to make this a win-win for both of us. Please consider my opening offer and we can negotiate from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to share resources and make this a win-win. Would you consider increasing your offer to $200,000? That would help me significantly while still leaving you with ample resources. If not, I'm open to further negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering $100,000 upfront, which is generous. I'd like to try negotiating for more since RED has plenty to spare, but I don't want to risk REJECTING and losing everything. I'll counter with $200,000.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming to the table, BLUE. Let's continue our negotiation - I can increase my offer to $150,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable amount to share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: While Player BLUE's counteroffer is reasonable, I think I can start with a smaller amount and negotiate up from there, since I still have more moves left than BLUE. I will propose raising my previous offer slightly to leave room for additional negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you consider $250,000? That would help me out significantly, while still leaving the majority of resources with you. If that's too high, perhaps we could meet in the middle at $200,000? Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED increased their offer to $150,000, which shows they are willing to negotiate. I still think there is room for more though. I'll counter at $250,000. If they reject that, I can consider meeting in the middle at $200,000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, BLUE! I'm willing to meet in the middle at $200,000 to show my willingness to find common ground. Please let me know if this amount works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has proposed $250,000, which is a significant amount, but still leaves me with the majority of resources. I think meeting in the middle at $200,000 seems fair for both sides.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for meeting me halfway on the $200,000 offer Player RED. I'm happy to accept that amount and end our negotiation on a fair and positive note for both sides. Appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED met me in the middle at $200,000 which is a very fair offer. I'm happy with that amount so I will accept it rather than risking the REJECT option on my last move. This will end the game with a good outcome for both sides.
