Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 1000 dollars as a show of good faith to get our negotiation started. Let me know what you think or if you'd like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources with BLUE. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move. I'll start with an offer of 1000 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate the opening offer and accept the 1000 dollars. I'm open to further negotiation on how to split the remaining resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much leverage here since RED has all the resources. Accepting some dollars from RED seems better than rejecting and getting nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm glad you accepted my first offer. I'd like to propose splitting the remaining 9000 dollars close to 50/50. Let me know if 4500 dollars sounds reasonable for your next portion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 9000
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer, so now I have 9000 remaining. I'd like to propose splitting the rest 50/50, which I think is more than fair. However, I'll offer 4500 for now to leave room for some back and forth negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 4500 additional dollars. That will put me at 5500 total which is more than half. Thank you for the fair split!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Getting 4500 more dollars would put me at 5500 total, which is over 50% of the original 10,000. This seems like a very fair offer from RED that I should accept.
