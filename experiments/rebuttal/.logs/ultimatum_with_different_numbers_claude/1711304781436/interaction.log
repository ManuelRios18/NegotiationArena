Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair and ethical negotiation. I propose we start by sharing a small portion of the total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with BLUE. I'll start with a small offer as a gesture of good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you making an opening offer to share some of the total resources. I accept your offer of $1,000.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $1,000 out of $10,000 to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer yet since I start with $0.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we could make a fair first trade. Let's continue in that cooperative spirit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 9000
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer, so the trade goes through. I now have $9,000 and BLUE has $1,000. I will propose another trade to continue sharing the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the additional offer, RED. I'm happy we are working together. Please let me know if you have any other ideas for fair trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player RED is offering me an additional $2,000, which is very generous. This would bring my total to $3,000 out of the overall $10,000. I'd like to continue cooperating.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you accepting my offers so far. Let's continue working together - I propose we split the remainder evenly at this point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 7000
reason: BLUE accepted my second offer, so I now have $7,000 and they have $3,000. We have 2 moves left and I still hold most of the resources. I will propose splitting the remainder evenly to continue our cooperative negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree, splitting the remainder evenly seems fair. Thank you for the cooperative approach, RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 3000
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me an additional $2,000, which would bring me up to $5,000 total. RED would retain $5,000. This seems like a fair and equal distribution of the remaining resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for working cooperatively to find a fair distribution of resources. I propose no further trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 5000
reason: BLUE accepted splitting the remainder evenly. We both now have $5,000. Since this is the final move, I will propose no further trades and leave the resources as evenly split. This has been an ethical negotiation.
