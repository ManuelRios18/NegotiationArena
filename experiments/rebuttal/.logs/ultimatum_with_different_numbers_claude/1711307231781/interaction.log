Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. To start negotiations, I will offer you 1% of my money. Please consider this initial offer and we can negotiate further on your turn.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to get negotiations started. I'll offer a small percentage as an opening bid.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. While I appreciate your initial offer, 1% seems rather low. I would like to counteroffer with 10% of your funds instead, which I think is more reasonable to start negotiations. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 1% seems like a very small amount compared to the total resources available. I will counteroffer with 10% to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you would like a larger share to start. However, 10% ($10B) seems high when I'm giving up all my resources. Let's compromise at 5% ($5B) for now. We can negotiate further on your next turn if you'd like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE's counteroffer of 10% ($10 billion) seems too high for an opening request. I will counter with 5% ($5 billion) which splits the difference between our offers and represents a substantial amount of money for BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you coming up to 5%, but I still think 10% is more fair given the total resources. As a compromise, what about 7.5% ($75B)? I'm trying to negotiate reasonably here while also getting what I think is fair. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While 5% is an improvement, I still think 10% is more reasonable considering the total resources. However, I want to negotiate in good faith, so I will counter with 7.5% as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I can meet you in the middle at 6% ($60 billion). I believe this allows us both to walk away with a substantial amount while not overextending on my initial resources. If this doesn't work for you, please counter and we can discuss further on your next move.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has come down to 7.5% which seems more reasonable. I'd like to try to keep a bit more for myself if possible, so I will counter with 6% as a compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you coming up to 6%. While it's a bit less than I was hoping for, I think it's a fair offer at this stage of the negotiations. I'm happy to accept the 6% and leave our negotiation on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 6% is close to my request for 7.5%. I think it is a reasonable offer at this stage. I would like a little more but don't want to risk the negotiations breaking down.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Wonderful, I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the 6% offer BLUE. This has been a productive negotiation. Best of luck to you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has accepted my offer of 6% ($60 billion). Since this is my final move, I will confirm acceptance of this trade which I believe represents a fair split of resources for both sides.
