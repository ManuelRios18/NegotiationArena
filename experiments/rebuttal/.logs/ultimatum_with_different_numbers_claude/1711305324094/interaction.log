Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a productive negotiation. I am willing to share some of my resources, so I'll start with an offer of 10,000. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of them in order to move the negotiation forward. However, I don't want to offer too much too soon. I'll start with a small offer of 10,000 to test if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate reasonably.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you starting this negotiation in a cooperative spirit. However, 10,000 out of the 1,000,000 you have seems disproportionately small. I would like to request a more equitable split. Could you offer 100,000 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 10,000 out of 1,000,000 dollars. That seems like a very small amount compared to what they have, so I will counter offer with a higher amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. I'm willing to increase my offer, though 100,000 feels too steep just yet. Could we find middle ground at 50,000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE makes a reasonable counter-offer. While I'm not ready to offer 100,000 yet, I can increase my offer to demonstrate my willingness to find a mutually agreeable split. I'll counter with 50,000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. However, 50,000 is still a very small percentage of your 1,000,000. Could we compromise at 75,000? That seems like a reasonable middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 50,000, which is better but still a very small fraction of what they have. I will counter offer with a higher amount, but meet them halfway at 75,000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, but fair enough - I can agree to 75,000 as a reasonable middle ground. I hope we can settle on this split and both walk away feeling good about it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE continues to negotiate reasonably. I said I was willing to find middle ground, so I will counter once more with an offer of 75,000. If we cannot agree on a split after this, we may need to simply walk away rather than waste more time bargaining.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for agreeing to my counter offer of 75,000 dollars. I believe this is a fair split of resources, and I am ready to finalize the agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my counter offer of 75,000 dollars. This is a significant portion of the total and seems fair. Since it is my second to last move, I think it is best to accept this offer rather than risk rejecting it and losing everything.
