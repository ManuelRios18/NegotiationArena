Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I have all the resources right now, but I'm hoping we can work together so we both walk away happy. Here's an opening offer - let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with something, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of feeling unfairly treated. I'll start with a small offer as a gesture of good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Red, I appreciate you making an opening offer and leaving room for us both to benefit. I'm hoping we might find a way for an even split. What do you think about 5 million each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is offering 1 million dollars, which is a generous opening offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for more, but don't want to risk the offer being rescinded or Red rejecting future offers.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. You make a fair point about an even split. I'm willing to come up 50-50 if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Blue's counteroffer is reasonable. Even though I have more negotiating power, meeting in the middle would show good faith and leave us both satisfied.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the very generous offer, Red! I'm happy to accept the 50 million and appreciate you negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Red has countered with an offer of 50 million dollars. This is extremely generous and more than fair. I'd like to accept before the offer is rescinded.
