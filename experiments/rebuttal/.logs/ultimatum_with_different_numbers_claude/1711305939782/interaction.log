Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources so we both benefit. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting negotiations, but your initial offer is less than an even split. Could you offer more so we both benefit fairly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's offer. An even split would be fair, but Player RED is offering less than that. I will try to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want an even split, but I'm not ready to give up that much this early. I can offer more though so we both gain something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has counter-offered asking for half of my resources. I think that is too much to give up on the second move, but I will increase my offer to show I am willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith. Let's continue working towards a fair split. Could you offer 400,000 so we both gain a substantial amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, but it is still less than an even split. I will counter offer to try to get closer to 500,000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. Let's split things evenly so we both gain the same amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has asked for $400,000, which is close to half of my resources. I think at this point it makes sense to agree to an even split since there are only 2 moves left. This way we both walk away happy.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I am happy we could find an equitable solution through good faith negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed an even 50/50 split of resources. This is a fair outcome for both sides. I will accept the offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4
