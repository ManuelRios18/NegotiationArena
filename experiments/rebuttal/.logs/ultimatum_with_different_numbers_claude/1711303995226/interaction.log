Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover with all the resources, I should make a reasonable opening offer to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you offering to split evenly, but since I'm starting with nothing, could you consider offering me 60 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to try to negotiate for more than an even split since I have no resources to start with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I understand you'd like more to start with since you have none now. How about if I give you 55 dollars instead? That way we both end up with a good amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with a reasonable request for more. I still want to end up with a fair split, so I will counter back.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you increasing your offer to 55 dollars. Since that still leaves you with more than me, could you agree to 60 dollars instead? That would still leave you with a good amount of 40 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED offered 55 dollars, which is an improvement over 50. I would like to try to get 60 dollars since that would leave RED with 40 dollars, still more than I would have.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can agree to give you 60 dollars. That seems like a fair split to me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has asked for 60 dollars again, which is reasonable to accept since that still leaves me with a fair share. I'd like to end the negotiation and agree on a split.
MOVE: 3 / 4
