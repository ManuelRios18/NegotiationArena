Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the opening offer. I think we can find a split that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering $100,000 out of their $1,000,000, which seems like a fair opening offer. I will counter to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming to the table, but 300k is too steep of an ask for the opening bid. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE's counteroffer asks for too much. I will counter with a more reasonable amount that is fair for both sides.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $225,000 for now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 225000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED countered with $150,000. I would like to get more, but I think meeting in the middle between the original offers is fair for now.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I'm glad we could find a fair split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has come down in their request. I will accept meeting in the middle as a reasonable compromise.
