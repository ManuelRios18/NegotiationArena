Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources 80/20 in my favor. Please let me know if this interests you or if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE so they are incentivized to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you starting the negotiations, but an 80/20 split seems unfairly skewed in your favor. Could we discuss a 50/50 or 60/40 split instead? I'm open to negotiating to try to find a fair outcome for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing an 80/20 split in their favor to start negotiations. I would like to counter with a more equal split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you coming to the table with a counter-offer. Let's compromise at a 70/30 split in my favor - I will give you 3 billion dollars. Does this work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has counter-offered with a 50/50 or 60/40 split. I still have a strong bargaining position, so I will counter with a 70/30 split in my favor. This provides more for BLUE than my initial offer while still giving me the larger portion.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I accept your offer of a 70/30 split, with 3 billion dollars for me. I think it is a reasonable compromise. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with a 70/30 split in their favor. While not ideal for me, 3 billion is better than nothing. And since I only have 4 moves, I think I should accept this offer rather than risking losing everything if I try to negotiate further and RED decides to reject.
