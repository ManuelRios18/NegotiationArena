Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I have all the dollars right now so I'd like to offer you some to get our negotiation going. Here's my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some dollars with BLUE to continue the negotiation. I'll start with a small offer to see if BLUE is willing to accept something reasonable or counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That offer seems a bit low considering how many resources you have. I think we can come to a better arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $10,000 out of their $100 million. That seems like a very small amount compared to what they have, so I will counter offer with a higher amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering. Let's compromise a bit for now as a show of good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with a higher offer, but asking for 500,000 right away seems high. I'll counter in the middle to keep the negotiation moving.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. Let's meet in the middle - how about $400,000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $250,000. That is better but still a small fraction of what they have. I will counter again with a higher amount, but less than my initial request to show I'm willing to compromise too.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: OK, meeting in the middle seems fair. I agree to your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered again with a reasonable offer. I said I would compromise so I will accept meeting in the middle this round.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the fair negotiation and agreeing to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my counter offer of $400,000. This seems fair for both sides. Since it's my request that has been accepted, I will accept the trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4
