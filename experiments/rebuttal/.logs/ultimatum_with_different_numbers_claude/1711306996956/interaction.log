Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I have all the money to start. I propose giving you 1% of my money to get our negotiation going. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to start negotiations. I'll propose giving 1% to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you making an opening offer and starting our negotiation. 1% seems a bit low for me, but it's a good start. Perhaps we could find a middle ground that works for both of us. What do you think about 5%?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 1% of their money to start the negotiation. This seems like a reasonable opening offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you countering. 5% does seem fair. Since I have more moves left, I'd like to negotiate further if possible. How about a counter offer of 2% (200 billion)?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE countered with 5% which is 500 billion. That seems fair. I'd like to try negotiating a bit more though since I have more moves. I'll counter offer with 2% which is 200 billion.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you increasing your offer to 2% - that is still a substantial amount. To reach an agreement, I wonder if you could do 3%? That seems like it could work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with 2% of their money. While less than I proposed, it's still a significant amount and continues the negotiation. I'd like to try to get a bit more before accepting.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I agree to your proposal of 3% (300 billion). That is fair and I'm happy we could reach an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE countered again with 3% which is 300 billion. That seems very reasonable. I'm happy to accept that offer since I still have the majority of the money and we've reached a fair agreement.
