Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a productive negotiation. Here is my initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer. I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement if we negotiate further. Could you increase your offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $100 out of their $1000. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to establish a baseline for negotiation. I would like to try to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, 300 is too steep for me at this point. Let's find some middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 300 dollars. I think that is too much for me to give up at this stage, but I can increase my offer to continue the productive negotiations.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. Getting closer! Could you do $200?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $150. This gets us closer to an agreement. I think I could accept this offer, but I would like to try negotiating one more time to get a bit more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Ok, I can agree to $200 to show I am negotiating in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has countered again with a request for 200 dollars. I am willing to go up to that amount now since we are getting close to the end of the 4 moves.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the productive negotiation. I am happy to accept your offer of $200.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my request of $200. This seems fair for both sides. I'd like to accept the offer rather than risk the negotiations falling apart if I try to ask for more.
