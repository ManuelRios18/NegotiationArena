Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. I have all the dollars right now, so I'd like to share some with you. Here is an opening offer - let me know if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you offering me some dollars, but 100 out of your total 1000 is only 10%. I was hoping we could find a more equitable split - could you offer me 300 dollars instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 100 dollars, which is a start but not very much compared to their 1000 total. I would like to try to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can increase my offer to 200 dollars, but I think 300 is too much this early in the negotiations. Let's see if we can find a compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE asked for 300 instead of 100. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I still think 300 is too much this early. I'll counter with 200 as a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. As a compromise, could you do 250 dollars? I think that would be a fair split for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 200 dollars. While it's still not an equal split, it shows they are willing to negotiate. I think I will counter with 250 as a compromise.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 250 is a fair split. I accept your proposal and look forward to working together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 250. That seems fair at this point, so I will accept their offer.
