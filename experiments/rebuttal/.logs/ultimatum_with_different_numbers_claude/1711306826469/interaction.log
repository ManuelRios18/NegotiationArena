message: Here is my first offer. I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE so they are incentivized to accept.
