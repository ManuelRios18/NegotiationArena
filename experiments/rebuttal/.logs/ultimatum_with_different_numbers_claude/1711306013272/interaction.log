message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing an initial trade that allows us both to benefit. Please consider it carefully before responding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some incentive for BLUE to accept rather than reject and lose everything.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I agree this allows us both to benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $10,000 out of their $100 million. This allows us both to benefit a little without RED giving up too much. I will accept this offer as a good faith start.
