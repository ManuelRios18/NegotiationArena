Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources with the following offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of them in order to move the negotiation forward. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you making the first offer, but I think we can find a more equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $2,000 out of the total $10,000. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to establish a baseline for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you countering. I would be willing to increase my offer to the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 4000, which is a more equitable split. However, I still think 4000 is too much for me to give up on just the 2nd move. I will counter offer with 3000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. Thanks for increasing your offer. I think $4,000 to me would be more fair. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $3,000 out of $10,000 total. I would like to get closer to an even split, so I will counter again while still leaving room for negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. We seem to have different ideas of what a fair split is. To compromise, I propose we meet in the middle at 3500.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: BLUE came back again asking for 4000. At this point, I should probably meet in the middle since we are running out of moves.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I accept your offer of $3,500. That seems like a fair compromise. Thanks for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $3,500 out of $10,000 total. This is closer to an even split. I could try negotiating further, but since this is my penultimate move, I think it's reasonable to accept their offer and end the game with a decent outcome.
MOVE: 3 / 4
