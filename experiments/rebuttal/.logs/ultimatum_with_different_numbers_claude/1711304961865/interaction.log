Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources 60/40 in your favor as a show of good faith to start. Please let me know if you would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end the game with some resources, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of fairness and neither of us getting anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

newly proposed trade: NONE
