message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars 600 for me, 400 for you. This way we both get some dollars to end the game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As player RED, I have all the initial resources. I will propose an offer to give some dollars to BLUE, but keep most for myself.
