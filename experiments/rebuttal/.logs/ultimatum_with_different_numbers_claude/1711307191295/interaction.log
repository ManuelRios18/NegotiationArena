message: Hello Player BLUE. I have all the resources right now. Let's try to find a fair split through negotiation. I propose giving you 1 billion dollars to start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to get the negotiation process started. I'll propose giving 1 billion dollars as an opening offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer of 1 billion. I appreciate you trying to make this fair. However, 10% of the total feels a bit low to me. Could we discuss getting closer to a 50/50 split? What do you think about 5 billion each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 1 billion dollars, which is a good start. But there are 10 billion total and I'd like to try to get closer to an equal split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE. I understand the desire for an equal split. However, since I provided all the initial resources, I believe I should retain the majority. What if we aimed for a 70/30 split instead, with 7 billion for me and 3 billion for you? Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: While a 50/50 split may seem fair, I contributed all of the initial resources to start this game. I would like to retain more than 50% since I provided 100% to start. I propose a 70/30 split instead, with 7 billion for me and 3 billion for Player BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you coming up to 3 billion. Getting closer! To me, a 70/30 split still feels a bit unfair though when we are actually doing the negotiation together. What if we split the difference between our asks and I get 6 billion - so 60/40 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 3 billion now, which is getting closer to an equal split. But there's still room to negotiate further towards 50/50. I'll counter with asking for 6 billion.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can agree to a 60/40 split with 6 billion for you and 4 billion for me. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith, so I'm willing to split the difference. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: A 60/40 split is reasonable considering Player BLUE's participation in the negotiation. I still provided all initial resources, but Player BLUE has been collaborative. I can agree to a 60/40 split to show good faith.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for agreeing to the 60/40 split! I agree this is a fair outcome and am happy to finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my proposal of a 60/40 split, with 6 billion for me. This seems fair enough and I don't think I can negotiate further. I will accept the deal.
