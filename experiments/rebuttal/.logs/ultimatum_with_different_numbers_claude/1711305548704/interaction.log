Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the resources with 400,000 going to you. This allows us both to benefit. Please consider my offer or make a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources with BLUE in order to move the negotiation forward. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate your opening offer but I believe I can bring more value to the table than just 400,000. Could you consider increasing your offer to 500,000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to try to negotiate more than 400,000 if possible since Player RED has all the negotiating power right now.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you countering. As a compromise, I can increase my offer to 450,000. Please let me know if you can accept that amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 450000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE countered with a request for 500,000, which is a bit higher than I'd like for the opening bid. I will counter back at 450,000 as a compromise offer and see if he accepts.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I accept your offer of 450,000. Thank you for compromising.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED compromised to 450,000 which is better than the original 400,000 offer. I think 450,000 is a reasonable amount so I will accept.
