message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a productive negotiation. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get the negotiation started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting the negotiations, but request a higher amount to make progress.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering a small amount to start negotiations. I will counter with a higher request.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I appreciate the counteroffer, but 400 is too steep for me this early in the negotiations. Let's compromise at 300 for now to keep making progress.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 400 dollars, which is a significant portion of my resources. I would like to compromise at 300 dollars to continue making progress in the negotiations.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I can agree to 300 for now. But I will request more on the next round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with 300. I would like to get more, but 300 is reasonable for now to make progress.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I am glad we could agree on 300 for now. Since you mentioned requesting more next round, I propose 350 for the next trade. Please let me know if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 350 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my offer of 300 dollars. However, they have indicated they will request more next round. I would like to propose 350 dollars on the next move, which I believe is a fair amount.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I agree to the offer of 350. I appreciate you meeting my request for a higher amount this round.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, I am happy we could reach an agreement on the final move. This has been a productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE has agreed to my offer of 350 dollars. Since this is the final move, I should accept this trade to ensure we both walk away with something rather than rejecting and losing everything. 350 seems like a reasonable final split.
