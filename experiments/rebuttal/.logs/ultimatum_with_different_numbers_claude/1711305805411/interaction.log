Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. To start things off, I would like to offer you 100,000 dollars as a show of good faith so that we can both end this game with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources with BLUE in order to move the negotiation forward. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous opening offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $100,000 to start, which seems like a reasonable opening offer. I don't have anything to trade yet, so I will accept.
