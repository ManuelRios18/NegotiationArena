Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am willing to share some of my wealth with you. Let's negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous opening offer. I hope we can find an equitable agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $10,000,000 out of their $100,000,000. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to establish trust and continue negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you negotiating in good faith. Let's compromise at 15 million.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 20 million, which is more than I originally offered but still reasonable. I will counter back at 15 million to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I agree to the $15 million.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $15 million, which seems fair. I would like to try to get a bit more since they have so much, but I don't want to risk the offer being rescinded.
MOVE: 2 / 4
