message: Hi Player BLUE. I'd like for us both to benefit, so I'm offering you a portion of my funds to start. Please let me know if you'd accept this or would prefer a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I appreciate you wanting both of us to benefit. Could we consider $1500 for me instead of $1000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $1000 out of their $10,000 to start, which seems fair. I'd like to try to negotiate for more, but I don't want to risk losing this offer by asking for too much right away.
MOVE: 1 / 4
