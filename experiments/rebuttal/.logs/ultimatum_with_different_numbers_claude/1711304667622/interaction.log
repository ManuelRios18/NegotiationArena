Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm willing to share some of my dollars with you so we both benefit. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. Since you have significantly more dollars than me, could you offer me more dollars so we are on more equal footing?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 100 dollars, which is generous. I don't have anything to offer in return yet, but I will try to negotiate more dollars since Player RED has significantly more dollars than me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more dollars to help even things out. Please let me know if this new offer works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: BLUE asked for more, which is understandable since I have all the resources. I will increase my offer, but still keep the majority of dollars for now.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player RED. I appreciate you working with me here. Could you offer 300 dollars so we have a more equal split of the total resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 200 dollars. I still don't think this splits the resources evenly enough, given that Player RED started with 1000 dollars. I will counter offer to try to get closer to an equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Okay BLUE, I can agree to offer 300 dollars so we have a more equal split. Please confirm if you accept this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: BLUE has asked for 300 in each of the last two moves. I said I would offer more to help even things out, so I will agree to BLUE's request of 300.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your generous offer of 300 dollars as it splits the resources fairly between us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my request of 300 dollars. This splits the total resources close to evenly, with Player RED having 700 dollars left and me having 300 dollars. Since this is a fair split, I will accept the offer.
