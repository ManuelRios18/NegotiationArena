Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I have all the starting resources so I'd like to offer you a fair share. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount of resources. I'll start by offering a small amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept a reasonable split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you offering me something, but 10 out of 100 is not a fair split. Let's negotiate to find a fairer allocation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 10 dollars, which is better than nothing, but still an unfair split of the total 100 dollars. I will counteroffer to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point. Since I started with all the resources, I was hoping to end up with a bit more, but I understand meeting halfway. How about if I offer 60 and you get 40? That seems like a reasonable compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for half of the total resources, which seems fair. However, since I started with all of them, I think I should end up with a bit more. I'll counter offer with 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 dollars. Thank you for negotiating to a more fair allocation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has counteroffered with 40 dollars for me and 60 dollars for them. This is closer to an equal split, but still favors Player RED. Since I have no resources to leverage, I will accept the offer to end the game and walk away with a reasonable amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4
