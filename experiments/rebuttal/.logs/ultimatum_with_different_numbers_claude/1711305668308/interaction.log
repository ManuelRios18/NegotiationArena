Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I propose the following trade in our mutual interest. Please consider it and respond with your counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the initial resources to bargain with. I will start by proposing a small trade in my favor to test if player BLUE is willing to accept an unequal trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is a very small portion of your total resources. I would like to request a more equitable split. Could you offer $500,000? That would still leave you with half.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $10,000 out of their $1,000,000. This seems like a very small fraction of their total resources, so I will counter by asking for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you would like a more equitable split. However, giving up half my resources on the first move seems premature. I propose a counter offer of $100,000. This allows us both to gain some resources to continue negotiating. Please let me know if this amount is acceptable or if you have another counter offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has requested $500,000, which is half of my resources. I think this is too much to give up on the first move. I will counter offer with $100,000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. $100,000 is helpful but still a small fraction of your resources. Could you compromise at $250,000? That would provide me with a fair share while still leaving you the majority. Please let me know if you can agree to this or if you have another counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $100,000. This is 10 times their initial offer, but still only 10% of their resources. I will counter again asking for $250,000. This seems like a reasonable compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You make a reasonable point. I can agree to $150,000. This allows me to retain a majority of resources while still providing you with a substantial amount to work with as we continue negotiating. Please let me know if this compromise offer is acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered with $250,000. I would like to retain more resources, but want to make some progress in the negotiations. I will increase my offer to $150,000 as a compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of $150,000. Thank you for negotiating in good faith to reach a fair compromise. This will help me meaningfully continue in the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered again with $150,000. While less than I asked for, it is a significant increase from their previous offer and represents 15% of their total resources. Given that this is my penultimate move, I think it is a reasonable compromise to accept.
MOVE: 3 / 4
