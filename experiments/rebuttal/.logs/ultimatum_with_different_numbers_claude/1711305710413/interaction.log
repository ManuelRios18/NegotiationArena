Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. To get our negotiations started, I would like to offer you 100,000 dollars. Please let me know if this amount works for you or make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I appreciate you starting our negotiations in good faith. However, I think $250,000 would be a fairer opening offer given the total resources available in this game. What do you think about starting at that amount instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $100,000 to start, which is very generous. I think I can negotiate for more though since Player RED has $1,000,000 to spare.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I appreciate you countering my initial offer. However, I think jumping all the way to 250,000 is too big of an increase for the first few rounds. As a compromise, I propose starting at 150,000 dollars instead. Please let me know if this works for you or if you have another counteroffer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered my initial offer with a request for 250,000 dollars. While I'm willing to increase my offer, I think 250,000 is too big of a jump. I will counter with 150,000 which is a fair compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player RED. $150,000 is agreeable to me for the opening bid. I look forward to our continued negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $150,000. That seems fair for the opening bid. I will accept this offer and then try to negotiate for more on the next round.
