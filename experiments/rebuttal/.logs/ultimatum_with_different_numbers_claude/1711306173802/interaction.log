Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I'm proposing we split the money with 80/20 in my favor as a starting offer. Let me know if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you starting the negotiations, but an 80/20 split seems unfair given we're both bringing equal value to the table. I propose a 60/40 split instead, which still favors you but is more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is starting with an offer that heavily favors himself. I think a fairer split would be 60/40 or 50/50, so I will counter offer with that.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. I agree the 60/40 split you proposed is fair.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: A 60/40 split is more fair than my original offer. I would be getting the larger share still, so I think this is reasonable.
MOVE: 2 / 4
