Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I'd like to make you an opening offer to split the resources - I'll give you 40% (4000) of the dollars and keep 60% (6000) for myself. This way we both end up better off than if we can't agree. Let me know what you think or if you'd like to counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, Blue may reject out of protest. I'll start with an offer to split the resources 60/40 in my favor since I'm in the stronger bargaining position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you making the first offer, but I think 60/40 is not quite fair. Could we aim for something closer to 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think 40% is a bit low for an opening offer. I would like to get closer to an equal split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer. How about I give you 4500 (45%) and keep 5500 (55%)? That way we're both better off than walking away with nothing. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Blue countered with a 50/50 split. I'm hesitant to give up that much, but I also don't want to risk Blue rejecting and losing everything. I'll counteroffer with a 55/45 split in my favor - this way we both gain something.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of a 4500/5500 split. I am happy we could reach an agreement that benefits both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 45/55 split is closer to equal. I think I can accept less than half to avoid risking no agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4
