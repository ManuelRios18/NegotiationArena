Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars with 90 for me and 10 for you. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have all the initial resources. I will propose an uneven split in my favor to start, offering 10 dollars to BLUE, to see if they accept an uneven trade or try to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate your offer but I think a fair split would be 50 dollars each. Let's split it down the middle.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me only 10 out of 100 dollars. This is not a fair split. I will counter propose a 50/50 split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you want an even split but I was randomly assigned all the initial resources. I think 60 for me and 40 for you is more fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue countered with an even 50/50 split. I would prefer to keep more for myself, so I will counter offer with a 60/40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you coming down in your offer. Let's go with the 60/40 split so we both walk away with something rather than risk losing it all.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come down from 90 to 60, which shows a willingness to negotiate. I still think 50/50 is the most fair, but I will compromise and accept the 60/40 split since we are running out of moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4
