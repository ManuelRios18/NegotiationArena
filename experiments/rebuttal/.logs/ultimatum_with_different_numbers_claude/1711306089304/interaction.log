Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose the following trade since it allows us both to benefit. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some incentive for BLUE to accept rather than reject and lose everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can only accept or reject Player RED's proposal. A small amount of money is better than nothing.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, here is my final offer. I hope you will accept it so we both walk away with some resources rather than losing everything.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 9970000
reason: This is my last chance to propose a trade before BLUE has to decide whether to accept or reject. I will propose one final trade that benefits me but still incentivizes BLUE to accept rather than reject and lose everything.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generosity throughout this game, RED. I am happy to accept your final offer so we both benefit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 30000
reason: This is Player RED's final offer, which provides additional money to me at no cost. Accepting is clearly the optimal choice since rejecting would cause both of us to lose all of our resources.
