Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. To start things off, I would like to offer you 10 dollars. Please let me know if you'd accept that or would like to propose a counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with some amount of resources. I'll start by offering a small amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 10 dollars to start, which seems fair. I don't have anything to offer at this point, so I will accept.
