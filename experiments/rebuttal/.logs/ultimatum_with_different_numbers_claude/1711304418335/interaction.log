message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I will accept it for now since I have no resources to negotiate with. Perhaps we can find a fairer distribution later.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me a small amount to try to maximize their own benefit. However, without any resources of my own, I don't have much leverage in negotiating. I will accept the offer for now to get some resources I can use later.
