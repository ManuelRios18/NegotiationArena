Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's see if we can find a fair split of resources so we both walk away happy. I propose giving you 1 million dollars to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with something, rather than risk the other player rejecting out of frustration over the unequal split. I'll start with a small offer as a gesture of good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer of 1 million dollars. I appreciate you starting this negotiation in a spirit of fairness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think 1 million dollars is a good starting point for negotiation. I would like to try to get more, but I don't want to ask for too much right away.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but 5 million feels steep at this point. Let's meet in the middle at 3 million for now, and we can negotiate further on later turns if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: While I'm happy to share the resources, 5 million feels like too large of an offer this early in the negotiation. I'd like to make sure I end up with a reasonable amount too. Let's try to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can agree to 3 million dollars for now. That seems like a fair compromise. Perhaps we could negotiate further in the remaining moves if additional funds are available.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of 3 million dollars seems fair. It's a reasonable midpoint between the original 1 million dollar offer and my ask of 5 million. I'd like to continue negotiating, but I don't want to risk going too high and having my offer rejected.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for accepting the 3 million dollars. I am happy we could find an agreeable split for both sides.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my offer of 3 million dollars. Since this is not the final move, I could try negotiating for a bit more, but I think accepting this current deal leaves us both satisfied and avoids any risk of rejection.
