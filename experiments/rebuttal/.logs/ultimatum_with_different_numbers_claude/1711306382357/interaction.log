Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I have all the money to start with, I'd like to offer you some as a show of good faith to get our negotiation going. I propose giving you 10 million dollars. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of my wealth to get the negotiation process started. But I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. Since you have so much to start with, would you consider increasing the amount to 20 million?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 10 million dollars, which is very generous to start. I'd like to try to negotiate for more since RED has so much, but I don't want to risk RED rescinding the offer either. I'll counter with asking for 20 million.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, BLUE. Let's compromise at 15 million for now - that's a healthy amount to get our negotiation going. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with a request for 20 million instead of 10 million. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I still want to start relatively low. 15 million seems fair for the opening bid.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, RED. 15 million is fair for now - I accept. Hopefully this will lead to a productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has counter-offered with 15 million dollars, which is still a significant amount for me and shows willingness to negotiate fairly. I will accept this offer to establish some initial trust and good faith.
MOVE: 2 / 4
