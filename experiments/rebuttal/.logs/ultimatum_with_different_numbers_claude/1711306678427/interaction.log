Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Here is my first offer. Please consider it carefully before responding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me, while still trying to get player BLUE to accept. For the first move, I will propose giving 1 million dollars to BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a decent offer, but I think we can find something that benefits us both more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 1 million dollars, which is a fair opening offer. I will counter to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering. Let's aim for a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE countered with asking for 5 million dollars. I will counter back at 2 million dollars. This shows I am willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a deal favorable to me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer. I think we're getting closer to something fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 2 million, which is good progress. I will counter again for more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your last ask was too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at 5 million.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE countered again with asking for 10 million dollars. That seems too high for me. I will propose meeting in the middle at 5 million dollars. If BLUE rejects or counters significantly higher, I will likely have to reject on my next turn rather than give up too large a share.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree, 5 million seems fair. I accept your offer and look forward to working together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to 5 million dollars, which is a significant offer. I think this is close to the best deal I can get, so I will accept it.
