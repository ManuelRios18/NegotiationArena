message: Hi Player BLUE. I'll offer you 10 dollars so we both have some resources to end the game with. Please let me know if you'd accept that or would want to negotiate a different split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start by offering a small amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.

message: Thanks for accepting the offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my initial offer of 10 dollars. Since there are no future games, this seems like a reasonable split that leaves us both better off. I will accept the deal and end the game.
