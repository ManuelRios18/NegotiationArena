Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose an initial trade that allows us both to benefit. Please review and provide your counter-offer if you'd like different terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE so they are incentivized to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Let's start small and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will counter offer since 5 million seems too high. I think 1 million is a fair starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: I still have all the bargaining power, so I would like to propose a trade more favorable to me. However, I will provide some benefit to BLUE so they are incentivized to keep the game going.
MOVE: 2 / 4
