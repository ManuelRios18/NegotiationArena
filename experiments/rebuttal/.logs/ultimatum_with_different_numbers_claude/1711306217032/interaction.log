message: Hello Player BLUE. Let's have a good game. I would like to offer you some resources to get our trading started. Please consider my offer and respond with a counteroffer if you would like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them in order to move the game forward. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first move. I'll start with a small offer to see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting the negotiation, but would request more to make a deal. What do you think of $50,000?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering a small amount to start negotiation. I will counter with a higher request.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. Let's meet in the middle at $30,000 for now. We can revisit the amount on future moves if needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered my original offer and asked for $50,000 instead of $10,000. I would like to continue negotiating, so I will counter with a value in between. $30,000 seems reasonable.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: Thank you for the reasonable counter offer. I accept the $30,000 and look forward to further trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED countered with $30,000. I will accept this as a reasonable middle ground for now to start building resources.
