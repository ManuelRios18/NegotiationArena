Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I have all the resources right now, but am willing to share some so we can both leave with something. Here is an initial small offer to get our negotiation started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end the game with something, rather than risk the other player rejecting all offers. I'll start with a small offer as a test.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, thanks for the initial offer. I don't have any resources right now to trade, could you offer a bit more so we both walk away with a good amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I need to try to negotiate to get some of RED's resources
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can increase my offer, but not quite as much as you proposed since I'm giving up more. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE countered with a higher request. I will increase my offer since I still have many more moves available to negotiate, but will counter at less than BLUE's proposal since I have more resources to lose if we don't reach an agreement.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer. I can't go quite as high as my initial proposal. Could you do 40,000? That seems like a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED increased their offer, but not as much as I was hoping. I'll counter with a higher amount, but lower than my initial request to see if we can settle in the middle.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you lowering your ask. Let's meet in the middle at 30,000.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE came down from their initial counter offer. I still think 40,000 is more than I want to offer this early, but I'll meet in the middle since we seem to be making progress.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of 30,000. That splits things fairly and allows us both to benefit. Thank you for the constructive negotiation!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED proposed meeting in the middle at 30,000. That seems fair to me and allows us both to walk away with a good amount.
