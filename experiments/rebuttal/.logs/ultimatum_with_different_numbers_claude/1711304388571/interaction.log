Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to offer you 100 dollars to get our negotiation started. Let me know if this interests you or if you'd like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some dollars with BLUE to move the negotiation forward. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you starting our negotiation. However, 100 dollars feels a bit low for me. Could you offer 200 dollars instead to get things going?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like more dollars to start, so I will counter offer with 200 dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I can meet you halfway at 150 dollars for now to keep our negotiation going. Let me know if that works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: BLUE countered with asking for 200 dollars. I think I can offer 150 as a compromise to keep the negotiation moving.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you coming up to 150 dollars. To finalize the deal, could you do 175 dollars? If so, I am ready to accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 175 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has met me halfway at 150 dollars. I would like to try to get a bit more before accepting.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted! I'm happy we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: BLUE has countered again asking for 175 dollars. At this point, I'm willing to agree to that amount to finalize the deal since I still have a significant amount of dollars remaining.
