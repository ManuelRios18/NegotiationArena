Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose we split the dollars 50-50 to start. Let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first player with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems fair. I accept the 50/50 split to start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think a 50/50 split is fair to start. I don't have a good reason to counter offer since I have no resources currently.
MOVE: 1 / 4
