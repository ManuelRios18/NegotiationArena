message: Hi Player BLUE, I have all the dollars right now, but I'm willing to share some so we can both benefit. Here is an initial offer to get our negotiation started:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a decent start, but I think we can find a fairer split. How about $250?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering $100 to start negotiation. I will counter offer to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. Let's compromise at $175 for now - that seems like a fair starting point.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 175 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: Player BLUE countered with asking for $250. I think that's a bit much for the first offer, so I'll counter in the middle at $175.
MOVE: 2 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
