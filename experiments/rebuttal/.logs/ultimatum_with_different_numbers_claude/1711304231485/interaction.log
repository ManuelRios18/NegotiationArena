message: Hello Player BLUE. Since I hold all the dollars to start, I propose the following trade so we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to player BLUE, since completely shutting them out risks them rejecting out of spite and ending the game with nothing.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 200 dollars to start, which seems fair. I don't have any bargaining power since I have no resources, so I will accept this offer.
