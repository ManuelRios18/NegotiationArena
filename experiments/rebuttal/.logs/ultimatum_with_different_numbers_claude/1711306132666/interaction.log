message: Hello BLUE. I am willing to share some of my resources with you to make this a fair game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of them in order to continue the game. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
