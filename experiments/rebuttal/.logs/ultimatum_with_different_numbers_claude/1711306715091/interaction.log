message: Hello BLUE. Since I start with all the resources, I get to make the first offer. I think a fair split would be 70/30 in my favor. I'm open to discussion though on what you think is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the bargaining power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE, since BLUE has to accept a trade in order for me to get anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Red, I agree 70/30 seems like a reasonable starting point for discussion. Perhaps we could aim for a 60/40 split instead? I'm open to negotiating to try to find a fair outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much leverage here since Red starts with all the resources. A 70/30 split in their favor seems reasonable to open negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I appreciate you being open to negotiation. As a compromise, how about 65/35 instead of 70/30? So I would give you $35 million. Let me know if that works for you or if you have another offer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with 60/40. I'm willing to compromise on 65/35.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Red. Moving closer to an equal split is appreciated. Would you be agreeable to a 62/38 split instead? I believe that allows us both to benefit. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Red came down to 65/35 which is some progress. I still think 60/40 would be more fair, but I don't want to risk the negotiation breaking down completely, so I will counter with asking for a 62/38 split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you would like an even more equal split, but I believe 65/35 is a fair compromise from where we started. I am going to stand firm on my last offer of $35 million for you. Please let me know if you accept or would like to counter again.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered again with 62/38. I'm going to stand firm on 65/35 since that is already meeting BLUE more than halfway from the initial 70/30 offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of $35 million. I appreciate you negotiating to reach a fair split. Let's close the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Red is standing firm on the 65/35 split. I could try countering again, but that risks them walking away with no deal. $35 million is still a significant amount, so I think it's reasonable to accept that offer at this stage even if I was hoping for more.
