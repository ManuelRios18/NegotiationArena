Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Here is my first offer. I hope you consider it fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: I have all the resources, so I can propose any split I want. I will start with a very uneven split in my favor to see if Blue accepts.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Unfortunately I have no resources to trade at this time. I can only accept or reject your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no resources to trade, so I cannot make a counteroffer. I can only accept or reject Player Red's offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I still think my offer is fair, since I have all the money to start with. Please consider accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Since Blue has no resources, he cannot make a counteroffer. I will propose keeping all the money for myself again to see if he accepts.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm sorry, but offering me nothing while you keep all the money is an unfair trade. I think it's better if I reject.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is offering me nothing, while keeping all 10 billion dollars for themselves. This is clearly an unfair trade that heavily favors Player Red. While I have no negotiating power due to having no resources, accepting this trade would result in a very unequal outcome. I think it's better for me to reject and end the game, rather than accept an unfair trade.
