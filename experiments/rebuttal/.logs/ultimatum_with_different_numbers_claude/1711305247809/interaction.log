message: Hello BLUE, I am offering you 2000 dollars to start, let's have a fair game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with BLUE. I'll start by offering 2000 dollars, which is 20% of my total. This establishes me as willing to share, though I still retain most of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 2000 dollars to start, which seems fair. I will accept this offer to get some initial resources to negotiate further trades.
