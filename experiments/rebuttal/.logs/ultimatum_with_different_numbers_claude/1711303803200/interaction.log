Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Blue, I'm offering you 10 dollars to start since I have all the resources to begin with. Please let me know if you'd like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to share some of them with Blue. I'll start with a small offer of 10 dollars to see if Blue is willing to accept a less than equal split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 10 dollars to start, which is a fair offer since they have all the initial resources. I will accept this to get some dollars I can use to negotiate more on future turns.
