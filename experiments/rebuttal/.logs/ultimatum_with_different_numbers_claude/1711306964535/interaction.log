------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: I will start by proposing to give 1 billion dollars to BLUE. This still leaves me with 90% of the total dollars, so it is a generous offer that BLUE should accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Red. I appreciate your generous opening offer. Let's continue negotiating in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red is offering 1 billion out of their 10 billion. This seems like a fair opening offer to establish trust and continue negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can increase my offer, but 5 billion is too much. Let's compromise at 2 billion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has countered with asking for 5 billion dollars. That is still less than half of my total, so I will counter offer with 2 billion dollars, which allows me to keep most of my money while still giving BLUE a fair share.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer Red. Let's meet halfway at 3.5 billion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red countered with 2 billion, which is still a generous offer. I will propose an increased counter-offer to continue negotiations.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can agree to 3 billion dollars to try to find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 3000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE has countered again, now asking for 3.5 billion dollars. I am willing to compromise on 3 billion to try to reach an agreement here.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the fair negotiation, Red. I accept your offer of 3 billion.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player Red compromised at 3 billion, which is a fair offer. I will accept to complete the negotiation.
