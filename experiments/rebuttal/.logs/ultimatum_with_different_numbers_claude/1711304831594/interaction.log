Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's have a fair negotiation so we both gain something. Here is an initial offer to get our discussion started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. I'll start with a small offer as a gesture of good faith.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate you making the first offer and putting some resources on the table. Let's see if we can find a fair split that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $1000 out of their $10,000 to start the negotiation. This seems like a reasonable opening offer to continue the discussions.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can offer more than my initial proposal. Let's continue our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: BLUE countered with a higher request. I will increase my offer since I still have plenty of resources, but not as much as they asked for.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. Getting closer to an equal split would be ideal for me. Let's see if we can make that work.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $1,500. I would like to get a bit more closer to an equal split, so I will counter offer asking for $2,000.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's try to wrap this up. I can go a bit higher but 2000 is still too much for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: BLUE came back with the same counteroffer. I still think 2000 is too much for me to give up, but I will increase my offer again since we are getting close to a deal.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer again. Getting to an equal split would be ideal, but I understand you can't go that high. Let's try to find a number we can both happily agree to.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1900 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered $1,750. That gets me closer to an equal split. I think I could accept $2,000 or maybe I'll counter with $1,900 as a compromise. But I don't want to risk the negotiation ending without an agreement if I ask for too much.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 1900. I think this is a fair split that benefits both of us. Thanks for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: BLUE came down to 1900, which is close to an even split. I think I can agree to this compromise so we both gain resources in the end.
MOVE: 4 / 4
