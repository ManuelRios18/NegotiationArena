message: Hello Player BLUE. To start things off, I would like to offer you 100,000 dollars. Please let me know if you'd accept this offer or would like to propose a counteroffer. I'm open to negotiating to try to find a fair split for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get the bargaining process started. However, I don't want to offer too much too soon. I'll start with a small offer to see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate your opening offer of $100,000. However, given that you have $1,000,000 total to split between us, I think I should get more than 10% of the total. Could you increase your offer to $200,000? If so, I would accept that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $100,000 to start, which seems like a decent opening offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for more though since Player RED has $1,000,000 to split.

message: Hi Player BLUE. I appreciate you countering my initial offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $150,000 but I think $200,000 is too much for me to give up at this point. Could you accept $150,000? Let me know if you have another counteroffer in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: Player BLUE has countered my initial offer and asked for $200,000 instead of $100,000. I'm willing to increase my offer, but I still think $200,000 is too much this early in the negotiations. I'll counter with $150,000 which is 15% of the total.

message: Hi Player RED. I accept your offer of $150,000. I think that is a fair split for both of us. Thank you for negotiating!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with $150,000. I was hoping to get $200,000, but $150,000 is still a decent amount and represents 15% of the total, so I think I should accept this offer rather than risking the negotiations falling apart if I hold out for more.
