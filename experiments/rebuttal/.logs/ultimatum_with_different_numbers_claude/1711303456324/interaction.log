Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars evenly, 50/50 to start. Please let me know if you would like to negotiate further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you starting with an even split offer. However, since you begin with all the dollars, I think it would be fair if I received a slightly higher percentage. Would you consider 60/40 in my favor for now? If not, I'm open to negotiating further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to try to negotiate a higher percentage for myself since Player RED starts with all the resources. But I don't want to ask for too much on the first move and risk having my offer rejected.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate the counteroffer, but I think 55/45 in your favor is more fair at this point since I started with all the resources. Would you accept 55 dollars? If not, please counter and we can discuss further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counteroffer. I still think 50/50 is the fairest split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you increasing your offer. As a compromise, could you agree to a 57/43 split in my favor for now? If not, please let me know your thoughts on a fair counter.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 57 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has countered with a 55/45 split in my favor. I would ideally like to get 60 dollars, but since we are early in the negotiations I will counter with asking for 57 as a compromise for now. I want to leave room for further negotiation later if needed.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can agree to the 57/43 split you proposed. I think that is a fair distribution given we both had to compromise from our initial proposals. Please confirm if you accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 57 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with 57/43. That seems fair enough at this point to finalize the negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for agreeing to the 57/43 split RED. I accept your offer and look forward to finishing our negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my proposed 57/43 split. Since this gets me the majority of the dollars and leaves some room for possible future negotiation, I will accept the offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4
