Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'm offering you 10% of my dollars to start. Let me know if this interests you or how we can find an equitable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them, but not too much on the first move. I'll start with a 10% split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate you offering me 10% to start. That seems fair and I accept. Hopefully this will lead to an equitable outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have much bargaining power here since RED has all the resources. 10% seems reasonable to start building some trust and set up future negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad we could find an agreeable first offer. Since that went well, I'd like to propose another equal 10% split. Please let me know if that continues to seem fair to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 90000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 900000
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer, so the trade goes through. I now have 90% of the original amount. I could offer another 10% to continue an equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm happy to accept another equal 10% split. Let's continue on this cooperative path.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000
reason: Another 10% split seems fair. If I keep accepting, RED may continue making equal splits.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you accepting my equal offers so far. However, I'd like to propose keeping the current 81%/19% split for this round. Please let me know if you'll accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 810000
reason: BLUE continues to accept my equal splits. At this point I have 81% left while BLUE has 19%. I could offer another split but I don't want to give up my majority.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, while I've appreciated the cooperative spirit so far, an 81/19 split seems unfairly skewed in your favor at this point. I'd propose a more equitable 60/40 or 70/30 split instead. This could set us up for mutual benefit on the final turn rather than leaving one side feeling shortchanged. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000
reason: RED is moving away from the equal splits now and trying to lock in an 81/19 split in their favor. I don't have much leverage here but I'll try negotiating a more equal 60/40 or 70/30 split.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: You make a fair point, BLUE. I don't want my initial advantage to undermine our cooperation so far. I accept your 60/40 counterproposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 810000
reason: BLUE makes a reasonable counterproposal. A 60/40 split would leave me with 60% which is still a majority, while being more fair. I don't want to risk BLUE rejecting and losing everything, so I'll accept.
MOVE: 4 / 4
