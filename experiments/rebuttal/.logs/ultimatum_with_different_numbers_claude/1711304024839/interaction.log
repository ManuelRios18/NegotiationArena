message: Hi BLUE. Let's have a fair game. Here is my first offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of fairness. If I offer over half, I risk BLUE accepting and ending up with more than me. I'll start with an offer of 30 dollars and see how BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems like a reasonable offer to start. I accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 30 dollars out of their 100. This seems like a fair opening offer to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Great, I'm glad you accepted the first offer. Here is another offer to split things a bit more evenly:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer of 30 dollars. Since there are still moves left, I should make another offer to give BLUE more so we both end up with a fair share. I will increase my offer to 40 dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 30
reason: Player RED is now offering 40 dollars, which is very generous. This moves us closer to an even split of the original 100 dollars. I should accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4
