Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am willing to share some of my wealth with you. Let's have a productive negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some of my wealth to move the negotiation forward in good faith. However, I don't want to give up too much on the first offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, RED. Let's see if we can find a fair split that we both feel good about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 8000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 5 million dollars, which is a good start. I will counter offer to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer BLUE. Let me increase my offer slightly as a show of good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 6000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE countered with a higher request of 8 million. I will increase my offer slightly to show good faith, but not as high as their full ask since I still have more moves left.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer, RED. Let's try to find a fair compromise we both feel good about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 8000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED increased their offer to 6 million, which is good but still on the low side. I will counter again, asking for a more equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain BLUE! But I want us to end this game amicably, so I will agree to your request of 8 million. Let's call it a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: BLUE came back with the same counter offer of 8 million. At this point, I could reject and end the game out of stubbornness. However, it seems BLUE is fixed on that number and I have a large surplus of funds. I will acquiesce to their request, even though it is more than I originally wanted to offer, in hopes we can find mutual benefit and end the game amicably.
