message: Hi BLUE, I have all the resources right now so I'll make the first offer to share some with you. Here is my initial proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to give up too much. I'll start with an offer of 100,000 which is 10% of what I have.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous opening offer, RED. I accept. Let's continue negotiating in good faith to find an equitable split of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $100,000 out of their $1,000,000. This seems like a fair opening offer to establish trust and continue negotiation. I will accept it and then try to negotiate more on my next move.
