Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the dollars 50-50 to start. Please let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to split them fairly to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. I appreciate you starting with an even split offer. I think we can find an equitable deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me 50 dollars out of the 100 total. That seems like a fair starting offer to consider.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Deal accepted. Pleasure doing business with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 60-40 split still seems fair. I'd like to build some goodwill and trust by accepting their counteroffer.
