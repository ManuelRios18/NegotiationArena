message: Hi BLUE, I'm offering you 10 dollars to start our negotiation. Let me know if you'd like more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player who starts with all the resources, I should make an offer to share some dollars with BLUE to continue the negotiation. I'll start with a small offer to see how BLUE responds.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing the offer RED. I appreciate it, but I think 30 dollars would be more fair considering how much you have. Could you do 30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 20 dollars is a good start, but I think I can negotiate for more since Player RED has a lot to spare.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 30 dollars seems fair BLUE. Here is my offer for 30 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered again at 30 dollars. I'm willing to go up to 30 to continue the negotiation, but I don't want to offer too much and leave myself with too little.
