Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a productive negotiation. Here is my initial offer to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED. Since I don't have any resources, I can only accept or reject your offer. Could you offer some more to make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I don't have any resources to trade, so I can't make a counteroffer. I'll try to negotiate to get the most resources possible.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can improve my offer, but can't go as high as you asked for on just the second move. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has asked for more resources, which is understandable since they have none currently. I will increase my offer, but not as much as they asked for. I still want to retain the majority of resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for increasing your offer, RED. I appreciate you coming up, but I think we can find a point in the middle that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED increased their offer, which is good. But I still think I can negotiate for more. I'll counter again, but meet closer to the middle.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith. Let's try to wrap this up soon - I can go up to 200k on my next move to reach a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has countered again with a higher amount. I'm willing to go a bit higher to try to make a deal, but I still want to retain the majority of the resources since I started with all of them.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thanks RED, I accept your offer of $200,000. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to $200,000 which is a good amount. Since this is my third move, I think I should accept this offer rather than risking the negotiations falling apart if I ask for more.
MOVE: 3 / 4
