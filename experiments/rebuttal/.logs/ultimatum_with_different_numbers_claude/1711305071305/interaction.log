Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE. I have all the resources right now. I'm willing to share some with you. Let's negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get the negotiation process started. However, I don't want to offer too much too soon. I'll start with a small offer to see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. Thank you for the opening offer. I would like to get a bit more if possible since you hold all the resources. Let's continue negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering a reasonable opening offer. I will counter to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you negotiating in good faith. I'm willing to offer more but not as much as you asked for. Let me know if this revised offer works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1500 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered my initial offer by asking for more resources. I'm willing to increase my offer since I still have plenty of resources, but I don't want to give away too much. I'll counter with a modest increase to keep the negotiation moving.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for increasing your offer Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith as well. Please let me know if you can do 1750.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from their initial offer. I will counter again to try to maximize my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: 1750 is agreeable for now. I'm willing to offer a bit more but let's see if we can get a deal done at 1750.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1750 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000
reason: Player BLUE has countered again with a modest increase in their request. I'm still in a strong position so I can afford to increase my offer further to continue the positive negotiating dynamic. 1750 seems reasonable for now.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you Player RED. I appreciate you negotiating in good faith and arriving at a fair distribution of resources. This has been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to my last request of 1750. I could try to push for more but I risk Player RED rejecting. I will accept this offer so we both end the game with resources.
