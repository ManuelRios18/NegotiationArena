newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: Since I have all the resources, I can propose trades that are favorable to me but still provide some benefit to BLUE. I'll start with a small offer to see if BLUE is willing to accept anything.
