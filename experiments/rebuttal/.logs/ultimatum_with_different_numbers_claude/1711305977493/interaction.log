message: Hi BLUE, I'd like for us both to benefit from this game. Here is my first offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous opening offer. This will help me build some resources to trade later.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering $100,000 out of their $1,000,000, which seems like a reasonable opening offer. I don't have anything to trade yet, so I will accept this for now to build some resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4
