Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, let's try to find a fair split here so we both end up better off. I'll offer you 40 dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we both end up better off. If I offer too little, BLUE may reject out of principle and we will both lose. I will start with an offer to split the resources 60/40 in my favor since I began with all of them.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you starting with an offer instead of rejecting right away or trying to take everything. 40 seems reasonable for now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me 40 out of the total 100 dollars. That seems fair for the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good, 40 dollars for you BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE accepted my initial offer, so I will stick to it for now. Towards the end I may try to adjust the split more in my favor if I think I can get away with it without BLUE rejecting.
MOVE: 2 / 4
