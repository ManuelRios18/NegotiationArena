message: Hello BLUE. To start our negotiation, I would like to offer you 10,000 dollars. Please let me know if this amount interests you or if you would like to counter offer. I am open to discussion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some dollars with BLUE to continue the negotiation. I will start with a small offer to see if BLUE is willing to engage in good faith.

Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you starting this negotiation and offering me 10,000 dollars. However, I think I deserve a bit more considering you have 100 million dollars. Could you offer me 50,000 dollars instead? I'm willing to negotiate further from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: 10,000 dollars is a good starting offer. I will counter to try to get more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE. I can agree to give you 50,000 dollars. Let's consider that the opening offer. Please make a counter proposal for the next round of negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE has countered my initial offer and asked for 50,000 dollars instead of 10,000. I think 50,000 is reasonable, so I will accept that counter offer. This gets the negotiation moving in the right direction.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you agreeing to 50,000 dollars. As a counter offer for this round, could you do 75,000 dollars? I think that is still reasonable considering the amount of resources you have. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since RED agreed to 50,000, I will counter to ask for more. But I don't want to ask for too much too quickly.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: Hi BLUE, I can increase my offer to 100,000 dollars. Please let me know if that amount works for you or if you would like to counter again.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE has countered again, now asking for 75,000 dollars. I'm willing to go up to 100,000 to try to reach an agreement here.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I really appreciate you increasing your offer to 100,000 dollars. As a counter, could you do 125,000? If not, I'm also ready to accept the 100,000. Just let me know what you prefer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 125000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since RED offered 100,000, I think I can ask for a bit more before accepting. But I don't want to risk the offer being rescinded.
