Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Since I have all the resources to start, I will propose trades I believe to be fair. Please propose a counteroffer if you disagree with my proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
reason: As player RED, I have all the negotiating power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me but still provide some benefit to BLUE, since an extremely unfair split may cause BLUE to reject out of spite and neither of us would get anything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is proposing to give me $200 out of their $1000, which seems fair for the first move.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 250 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000
