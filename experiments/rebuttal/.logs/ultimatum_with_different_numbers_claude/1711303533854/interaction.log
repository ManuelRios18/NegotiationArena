Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the $100 evenly, with $50 each. This seems like a fair opening offer. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first mover with all the resources, I should make a reasonable opening offer to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems fair. I accept your offer of $50.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50/50 split seems reasonable to start. I'll accept the offer and see if I can negotiate more on later moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
