message: Hi BLUE, let's play a fair game. Here is my opening offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an offer to share some of them so we can both end up with something, but I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED. I appreciate you starting this negotiation. However, since you have all the initial resources, I request that you increase your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 500000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will counter offer with a request for more money since Player RED has much more to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I understand you want more, but 500K is too steep for me this early. As a compromise, I can offer 400K.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 400000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has countered with a higher request. I think 500K is too much for me to give up on just the 2nd move, so I will counter in the middle at 400K.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
