Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I am proposing we split the dollars 700k for me, 300k for you. Let me know if you would like to counter offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I will make an initial offer to give some dollars to BLUE in order to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That seems fair for now. I may counter offer later if I think I can get more.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think a 70/30 split is reasonable to start. I'll accept this offer for now and see if I can negotiate a more equal split later.
