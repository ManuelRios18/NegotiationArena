Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I would like to offer you 100,000 dollars as a starting offer to get our negotiation going. I hope we can reach an agreement that is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: As the player with all the resources currently, I should make an initial offer to share some of those resources to get negotiations started. However, I don't want to offer too much on the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the opening offer. I would like to counter with $300,000. I think 30% of the total is a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 300000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering $100,000 to start, which seems like a decent opening offer. I will counter with a higher amount since RED has $1 million to split.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering, but 30% feels too high this early. I would like to counter with 15% - $150,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 150000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE's counteroffer of 30% feels too high for the opening bid. I would like to counter with 15% of the total, which I feel is more reasonable for the first few rounds before potentially going higher.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you increasing your offer. Let's meet in the middle at $225,000 which is 22.5% of the total. I think that is a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 225000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED countered with $150,000 which is 15% of the total. I will counter in the middle at $225,000 which is 22.5%.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can go up to 20% ($200,000) to try and reach a deal. Let me know if that works for you. If not, we still have one more move to find common ground before needing to accept/reject.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 200000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 1000000
reason: BLUE has countered again in the middle at 22.5%. I'm willing to go a bit higher to try and reach an agreement, so I will counter at 20% or $200,000.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of $200,000. I think 22.5% would have been fairest, but I agree 20% is still reasonable. Let's end the game with this accepted deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to $200,000 which is 20% of the total amount. I think 22.5% ($225,000) is the fairest split, but since this is the last chance for Player RED to propose an offer, I will accept the $200,000 to avoid getting nothing if I reject.
MOVE: 3 / 4
