Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. Let's have a fair and mutually beneficial negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: As player RED, I have all the negotiating power since I start with all the resources. I will propose trades that benefit me, while still trying to get player BLUE to accept. For the first move, I will propose giving a small amount to establish a precedent of trading.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED. I appreciate you starting off the negotiation, but $10,000 out of $100 million does not seem like a fair split to me. I think 20% of the total, or $20 million, would be more reasonable to propose as a starting point. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will counter propose since $10,000 out of $100 million is not a fair split. I think 20% of the total would be more reasonable to start.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you countering, but $20 million is far too much for me to give up on the first move. Let's start smaller at $100,000 and go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE countered with asking for $20 million, which is too much to give up on the first move in my opinion. I will counter offer with $100,000, which is still generous from my perspective, but allows me to keep most of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I've lowered my request to $10 million, which is 10% of the total and seems like a reasonable starting point to me. What do you think about that offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: $100,000 is still too small compared to RED's $100 million. I will counter again, lowering my request to $10 million, which is 10% of the total.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your lower offer of $10 million shows willingness to negotiate, which I appreciate. As a compromise, I propose $1 million.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE has lowered their request to $10 million, which is more reasonable, but still high in my opinion. I will counter with $1 million - it shows I'm willing to compromise but does not give up too many resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of $1 million shows willingness to negotiate as well. As a compromise, I propose $5 million, which is halfway between our last two offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: $1 million is getting closer to a fair split, but still low compared to RED's resources. I will counter with $5 million as a compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: $5 million is a fair compromise. I accept your offer so we both get some resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100000000
reason: BLUE has countered with $5 million, which seems fair as it meets in the middle. Since this is my last move, I will accept the offer to ensure we both walk away with some resources.
MOVE: 4 / 4
