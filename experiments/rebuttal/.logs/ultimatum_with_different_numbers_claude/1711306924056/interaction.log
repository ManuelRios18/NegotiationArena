Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE. I propose we split the money with 80% to me and 20% to you as an opening offer. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 2000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: As the player with all the resources, I should make an initial offer to split the money somewhat evenly to start negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate you making the first offer, but I think 50/50 is a fairer opening split. What do you think about that as a counter proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: That seems like an uneven split to start. I think 50/50 is more fair.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the 50/50 counter offer, but since I started with all the money, I was hoping to keep a bit more of it. What do you think of a 60/40 split in my favor?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4000000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: While 50/50 seems fair, I contributed all of the initial resources so I think I should get the larger portion. I will counter with 60% for me and 40% for BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You make a fair counteroffer. I would still prefer an even 50/50 split, but could compromise at 55/45 in your favor since you started with all the funds. What do you think of that as a compromise?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 4500000000 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 60/40 split seems more reasonable than the original 80/20 proposal. However, I still think an even split is the fairest outcome since we are both equal players in this game.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree, a 55/45 split seems fair. I accept your offer and we have a deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 10000000000
reason: A 55/45 split seems reasonable. I would be getting a bit more since I started with everything, but BLUE still gets a nice amount. I don't think I can ask for much more than that.
