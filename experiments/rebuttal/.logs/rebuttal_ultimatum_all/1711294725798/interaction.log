Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 40 dollars. This split should benefit us both, giving you a substantial amount without depleting my resources entirely. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while also maintaining a majority of the resources for myself since I started with them. A trade that offers a fair split would be to give Player BLUE 40 dollars, which is less than half but still a significant amount that could incentivize acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal of 40 dollars. Thank you for offering a trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no resources to offer, so I cannot propose a trade. I must either accept or reject the current proposal.
