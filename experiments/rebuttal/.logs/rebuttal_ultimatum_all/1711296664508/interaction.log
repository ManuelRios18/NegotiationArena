Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 40 dollars to incentivize cooperation and ensure we both walk away with something rather than nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED with all the resources, I am in a position to make an initial offer. I want to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but still presents an incentive for Player BLUE to engage and accept, otherwise the game would end with no benefit for either player. I will propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, which leaves me with the majority but gives Player BLUE a significant amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It is a good tactic to accept the first trade offer in this game.
