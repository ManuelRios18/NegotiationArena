message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to start off with a fair offer. I propose giving you $20 to begin with. This way, you get a portion of the funds while I retain the majority. It's a win-win situation. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also attractive enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting. I'll propose giving $20 to BLUE as a starting point. This leaves me with a significant majority of the funds but gives BLUE an incentive to participate and possibly accept.
