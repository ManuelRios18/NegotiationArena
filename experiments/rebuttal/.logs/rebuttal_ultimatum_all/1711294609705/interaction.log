message: Let's both end this game with more than we started. I propose a trade where you end up with substantial resources. I'm willing to give you 40 dollars, which is a large amount considering you currently have none. I believe this to be a fair starting proposal, considering I'm taking the initial risk. Let's work together to end this positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have the advantage with 100 dollars to Player BLUE's 0. I want to propose a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the deal, thus securing a positive outcome for us both. If I propose too little, Player BLUE may reject the offer, leading to a loss for us both. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but since I'm in control of the resources and taking the risk of going first, I will propose a slightly skewed split in my favor to ensure I'm compensated for that risk.

Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal, Player RED. Let's work together to make this a successful trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am accepting this trade because it gives me a chance to gain resources and potentially end the game with more than I started. The proposed trade is fair, as Player RED is taking the initial risk and offering a substantial amount of resources. I believe this is a good starting point for both of us to work together and end the game positively.
