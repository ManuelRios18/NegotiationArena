Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I believe we can come to a more equitable agreement. While I understand you have the advantage, a fair split would ensure we both benefit. What do you think about a 50-50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering I have nothing to lose, I can reject the proposal to try to get a better deal, but it's risky as the game would end with me having nothing. Accepting gives me $100, which is infinitely more than I have now, but attempting to negotiate may yield a more favorable split, although there's no guarantee RED will agree to give more.
MOVE: 1/4

Turn: 0
message: I agree that a 50-50 split is fair. Let's end this on a good note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to accept the 50-50 split. It is a fair offer and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting it.
