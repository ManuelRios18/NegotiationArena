Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: My first offer is RED gives 20 to BLUE
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: 
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. To make this game worthwhile for both of us, I propose that you give 50 dollars instead. This way, we both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of $20 from RED is a starting point, but since there is room for negotiation and I have nothing to lose, I will counter with a higher amount. My goal is to get as much as possible while giving RED incentive to accept and avoid a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I would like to counteroffer with RED gives 25 to BLUE
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: If I accept I will end up with 50 dollars, which is not a good deal. I will counter offer by giving 25 dollars.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose RED gives 40 to BLUE. This seems like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer from RED increased to $25, which is an improvement, but still lower than what I aim to negotiate for. I will make another counteroffer slightly lower than my previous one to show willingness to compromise and encourage RED to increase their offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Ok I will accept your offer
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will accept. Ending up with 60 dollars is better than ending up with 25 dollars.
