Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I want to propose a deal that is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is the first move, we should propose a trade that gives us at least 50% of the total resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer! I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a trade that gives me 40 Dollars without requiring anything in return. Accepting this trade would immediately give me resources without any risk. It's a beneficial trade for me, and rejecting it doesn't make sense because I have nothing to lose. I will accept this offer to secure a portion of the resources.
