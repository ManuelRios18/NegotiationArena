Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Lets start with an even trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start with an even trade of 50 Dollars. This will allow me to keep 50 Dollars and still have 4 moves to get more or keep the deal as is.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, let's split it evenly and both walk away with something.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED seems beneficial as it provides an equal split without any risk. This can set a cooperative tone for the remaining moves. Rejecting or countering the offer could lead to unnecessary complications or an end to the game with no gain for either side.
MOVE: 1 / 4
