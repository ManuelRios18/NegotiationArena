Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this off on the right foot. I'm willing to share my resources with you so we can both benefit. How about a fair split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm considering making an initial offer that is somewhat generous to incentivize Player BLUE to engage and accept a trade rather than rejecting it outright. A 50-50 split might seem fair and would guarantee that we both walk away with something rather than nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sure, I'll accept your offer of 50 Dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no resources and it is best to start with accepting the offer.
