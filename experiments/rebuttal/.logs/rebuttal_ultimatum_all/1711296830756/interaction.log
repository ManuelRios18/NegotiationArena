Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to start by offering you a trade where you receive $20. This is just an initial offer to open negotiations. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that gives BLUE a reason to participate while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself. I will offer a small amount to test the waters and see how BLUE reacts.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would like to accept your offer of $20 to start. Let's see if we can find a solution that is fair to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will accept the $20 offer since it is more than half of what RED has ($100) and it is a good starting point for negotiations.
