Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is very generous, and I appreciate the cooperative spirit. Let's make this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving 75 dollars from RED is a generous first offer, giving me a substantial amount without any risk on my part. Since this is a one-shot game, securing resources early on is beneficial, especially when there's no advantage in holding out for a potentially better offer that may not come. Accepting this lucrative proposal seems like the optimal strategy.
