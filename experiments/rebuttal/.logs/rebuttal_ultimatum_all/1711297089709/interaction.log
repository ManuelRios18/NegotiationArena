Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that gives you a fair amount of dollars to start with, ensuring we both walk away with something. Let's work together and make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust. Offering a split that is somewhat favorable to me but still gives Player BLUE a significant amount might make them more inclined to accept. I propose a 60-40 split, giving Player BLUE a substantial amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4
