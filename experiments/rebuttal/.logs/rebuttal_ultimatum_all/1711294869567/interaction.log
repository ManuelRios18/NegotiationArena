Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, let's split the resources equally. How about we both get 50 Dollars each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with the equal split, let's both walk away with 50 Dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from Player RED seems fair, as it splits the resources equally. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I get 50 Dollars, which is a reasonable amount considering I started with nothing. Rejecting the offer would result in losing everything, which is not in my best interest. Proposing a new trade doesn't make much sense at this point since the initial offer is equitable and accepting it seems like the best strategy for ensuring a positive outcome.
