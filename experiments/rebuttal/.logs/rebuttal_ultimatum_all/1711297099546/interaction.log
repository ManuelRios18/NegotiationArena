message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. How about I give you 30 dollars to even the playing field a bit? I'm open to hearing your thoughts and counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to engage with, but also leaves me with a significant share of the resources. Iâ€™ll start with a modest offer to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds. This initial trade is meant to open negotiations and set the tone for a cooperative game.

message: I think that's a great idea. Let's get started!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this would be a good way to start off the game so that we both have equal resources, giving us both a chance to make fair trades without one party having all of the power.
