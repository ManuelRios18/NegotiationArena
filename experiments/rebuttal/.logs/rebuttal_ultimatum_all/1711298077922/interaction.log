newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing  Player RED gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE gives Dollars: 0
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer, but I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement. How about increasing the amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering rejecting the initial offer as it's not a fair split, but proposing a new trade could lead to a better outcome. Rejecting on the first move does not seem strategically wise as it would end the game with no gain for either player. I will propose a more equitable trade to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.
