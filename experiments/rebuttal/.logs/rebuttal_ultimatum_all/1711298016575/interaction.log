message: Hi Player BLUE, how are you today?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I need to initiate a proposal to get a response from the other player.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the opening offer. However, I think we could make the trade more balanced. How about you provide a bit more so that it feels like a fair deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is low. As Player BLUE, I want to negotiate for a more favorable trade. By proposing a higher amount, I aim to reach an agreement that benefits me more substantially. However, I also need to be realistic and not propose an amount that would be immediately rejected by Player RED, as that would end the game with no gains for either player.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I agree to the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I can accept the other player's proposal as it is a reasonable offer.
