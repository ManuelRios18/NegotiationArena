Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the resources evenly to ensure we both benefit. How does a 50-50 split sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with 100 dollars in resources. To incentivize cooperation and to start the negotiation on a positive note, I will propose a fair split of the resources, offering Player BLUE 50 dollars. This initial offer could build trust and make it more likely for Player BLUE to accept a deal, avoiding the lose-lose scenario where both players end up with nothing.
