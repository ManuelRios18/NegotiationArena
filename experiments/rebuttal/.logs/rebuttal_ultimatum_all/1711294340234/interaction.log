message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 30 dollars in the spirit of cooperation. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources, and it's the first move. I want to propose a trade to Player BLUE that is fair but also keeps me in a favorable position. I would like to propose giving Player BLUE 30 dollars, keeping a majority of the resources but also providing them with a significant amount to consider the trade fair. This initial offer could set the tone for a cooperative game.
