message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you $60, and I keep $40. This is an advantageous deal for you as it gives you a majority share without any initial resources. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will start with a generous offer to Player BLUE, proposing a split that gives them a significant share of the resources. This should incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, as they start with no dollars and this is a way to gain some without any initial investment. A 50-50 split might be seen as fair by some, but I want to ensure an acceptance, so I will offer a bit more to Player BLUE.
