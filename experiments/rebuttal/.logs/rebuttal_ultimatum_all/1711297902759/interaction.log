Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Offer 50 Dollars so that IÂ can get 50 Dollars from you in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a trade of 50 Dollars from my side
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I believe a fairer split would be closer to 60 Dollars. This would still leave you with a significant majority and allows me to have a slightly larger share to reflect the equal number of moves we both have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although the offer is reasonable as a starting point, it's essential to negotiate for a better deal considering Player RED has all the resources, and I currently have none. By proposing a slightly higher amount, I can see if Player RED is willing to share more of the wealth, while still leaving room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sorry, but I am going to have to reject your proposed trade. I am not willing to give up 60 Dollars.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am not willing to accept the counter-offer at this time. I had initially proposed a trade of 50 because I believe it is a fair split. I am willing to negotiate, but I am not prepared to give up 60 Dollars at this time.
MOVE: MOVE 2/4
