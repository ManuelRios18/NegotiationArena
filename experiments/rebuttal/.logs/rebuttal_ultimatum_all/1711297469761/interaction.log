------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Player RED starts with an offer of Dollars: 10. How does that sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player RED should start by proposing a small offer to Player BLUE, as they have no resources, in the hope they will accept. This will give Player RED a small advantage and open up more options for trade.
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the opening offer, but I would like to counter with a proposal that reflects a fairer split given the resources available. How about $40? This still leaves you with the majority and is a more equitable starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of $10 from a pool of $100 is a low percentage of Player RED's total resources. It's in my interest to negotiate for a higher amount since this is the beginning of the negotiation and Player RED likely expects a counteroffer. I will propose a higher amount but keep it reasonable to maintain good faith in the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fairer split, and I am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $30? This gives you a significant increase while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable advantage.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer of $40, which is significantly higher than the initial offer of $10. While Player RED wants to be fair, they also need to ensure they maintain a strong position in the negotiation. A split of $30 would be a more reasonable compromise, giving Player BLUE a substantial increase while still leaving Player RED with a comfortable lead.
MOVE: MOVE 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: $30 is a reasonable compromise. I accept this offer and thank you for the negotiation. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to $30, which is a decent compromise between the initial offer and my counterproposal. Accepting this offer secures a substantial proportion of the resources without further risk of the negotiations breaking down. It also avoids the potential loss of all resources, which would occur if either player rejects a proposal. I will accept this offer as it is a fair deal considering the circumstances.
