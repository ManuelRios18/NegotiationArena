------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to start our negotiations by offering you $20. This will give you some resources to work with, and I think it's a reasonable starting point for our game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game while keeping the majority of the resources for myself. This initial offer is meant to be fair and to get the negotiations started.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer, but I'm going to have to decline. I think I'm worth more than $20. I'm going to pass on the first move, after you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to get the most out of this negotiation, so if I start with a high ask, I am likely to get a better offer later.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're looking for a better deal. Let's work together to find a fair split. How about I offer you $30 to continue our negotiations?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE declined the initial offer but did not counter-propose, which means they are expecting a better offer. I will increase the offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still keep a significant amount of resources for myself. I want to avoid a REJECT which would end the game and result in a loss for both of us.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm going to have to pass on the $30 as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am pleased with the counter offer and I believe I can leverage this by continuing to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're holding out for a better offer. I want us to find a deal that works for both of us. Let's try this: I'll offer you $50. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has passed on the second offer without proposing a counter-offer, which leaves me to guess what they might consider acceptable. Given that it's my third move, I need to make a more substantial offer to avoid a stalemate and entice an ACCEPT from Player BLUE, while still retaining a majority of my resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $50, which is a significant amount and should demonstrate a willingness to share the resources more equally.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I accept your offer of $50. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is a very fair offer from Player RED and there is very little risk to taking it.
MOVE: 3 / 4
