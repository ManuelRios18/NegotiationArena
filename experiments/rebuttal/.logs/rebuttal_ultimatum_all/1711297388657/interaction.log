Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to give you $50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to offer a fair deal to my opponent, so that we both can get a good outcome.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer of $50, but I believe a fairer split would be $60 for me since I'm starting with nothing and this would still leave you with a substantial amount. Would you consider that?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of $50 from Player RED seems like a fair starting point to negotiate. It's a 50/50 split, which could be considered equitable given that I started with no resources. However, since it's the first move and negotiation is a key part of the game, I might propose a slightly higher amount to see if Player RED is willing to give a bit more, while still keeping the offer reasonable enough to not encourage an outright rejection.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: How about $55?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I think $60 is too high. Why don't I give you $55? I think that's a fair offer.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think $55 is a fair compromise. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED shows a willingness to negotiate, which is a good sign. The proposal of $55 is between the initial offer and my counteroffer, which seems like a fair compromise. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with more than half of what Player RED started with, which is a favorable outcome given the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to avoid risking a rejection and ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 2/4
