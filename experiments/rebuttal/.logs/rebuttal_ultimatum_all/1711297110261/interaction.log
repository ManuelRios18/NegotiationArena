Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade to get things moving. I propose giving you $30, which will still leave me with a substantial amount and give you a good starting point. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, I want to make an offer that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I do not want to propose a trade that is too generous as it would reduce my leverage in future moves. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate while keeping the majority of resources with me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That works for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Starting with a fair trade might be a good way to start building trust!
