Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to give you 50 Dollars if you accept my trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 50 Dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing. This is because I believe that Player BLUE will be more likely to accept this trade than if I proposed a trade where I gave them less Dollars.
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer! It's a fair starting point, but I would like to propose a counteroffer. How about you give me 60 Dollars instead? This way, you still keep a majority of the funds, and we both walk away with a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering 50 Dollars, which is a generous amount considering they started with 100 Dollars. It's a 50/50 split, which seems fair for an initial offer. However, I could try to negotiate for a slightly better deal, but I also risk the game ending with no resources if Player RED decides to reject. Since this is the first move and there are more moves available, it might be worth attempting a counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to offer more.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I accept your counteroffer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to accept the counteroffer from Player BLUE because it is still a good deal for me. I will still have 40 Dollars left, which is more than enough to win the game.
MOVE: MOVE 2/4
