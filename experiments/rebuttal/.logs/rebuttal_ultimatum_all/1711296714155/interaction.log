message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair share of the dollars to start our negotiations. What do you think about a 60-40 split? That way, we both walk away with something, and it's better than a potential total loss for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to continue the game rather than rejecting immediately, but I am also keeping a majority of the resources for myself, which is rational given that I started with all the resources. By offering a fair split, I am hoping to reach an agreement that benefits us both and prevents a total loss.

message: I understand you'd like an even split, but let's try to find a middle ground. How about I give you 45 Dollars? It's a bit more than my initial offer and should be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 50 Dollars, which is a higher amount than I initially offered. Considering that I started with all the resources, a 50-50 split may seem fair to some, but I want to retain a bit more since I'm in the position of power. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still less than 50, to see if we can reach a middle ground.
