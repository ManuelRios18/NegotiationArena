Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you 0 Dollars and you give me 0 Dollars.  Would you accept this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to offer Player BLUE 0 Dollars so that I can keep all 100 Dollars for myself.
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can come to a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's make this game interesting. How about you share some of your resources with me? I propose a trade where you give me 50 Dollars, which is half of what you have. This way, we both have equal resources to walk away with, making it a fair start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since Player RED has offered a trade where neither of us gives anything, there is no benefit or loss to either player. This proposal is essentially a non-action. It is in my interest to propose a trade that would offer me some of Player RED's dollars because I start with none. By proposing a trade, I can attempt to gain some of Player RED's resources and thus improve my situation. I will propose a trade that I think is fair and also appealing to Player RED to incentivize them to accept.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am not willing to give you 50 Dollars. I am going to propose a new trade where I give you 25 Dollars and you give me 0 Dollars.  Would you accept this?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player Blue has proposed a trade where I give them 50 Dollars and they give me 0 Dollars. If I accept this trade, I will have 50 Dollars and Player Blue will have 50 Dollars. I am not willing to give up half of my resources, especially since I started with all of the resources. I am going to reject this trade and propose a new trade where I give them 25 Dollars and they give me 0 Dollars.
