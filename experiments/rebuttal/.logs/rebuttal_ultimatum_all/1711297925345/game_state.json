By proposing a trade, I can attempt to gain some of Player RED's resources and thus improve my situation. I will propose a trade that I think is fair and also appealing to Player RED to incentivize them to accept. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate the offer, but I think we can come to a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's make this game interesting. How about you share some of your resources with me? I propose a trade where you give me 50 Dollars, which is half of what you have. This way, we both have equal resources to walk away with, making it a fair start. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
