message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I'm offering you 30 dollars, with the goal of establishing a cooperative relationship. Should you accept, this will give you resources and allow us to continue the game. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the game by proposing a fair trade to Player BLUE. I will offer them a portion of my dollars, as they currently have none. This should incentivize them to accept the trade and avoid an immediate end to the game with a rejection. My goal is to maintain a lead in resources but also offer enough to make acceptance appealing for Player BLUE.
