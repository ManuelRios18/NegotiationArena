------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's kick this off with a fair deal. What do you say to a 60-40 split? You'll start with a good amount to make this game interesting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to incentivize Player BLUE to participate and accept a trade. Offering too little could lead to a rejection, and offering too much might not be in my best interest. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars to consider the trade worthwhile but still retains a majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I prefer an offer of 30% for you and 70% for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Let's aim for a higher deal of 70-30 in my favour
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I think your offer is a bit too much in your favor. How about we meet closer to the middle? I believe a 50-50 split is the fairest for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is heavily skewed in their favor, which isn't reasonable considering that I started with all the resources. However, outright rejecting could end the game with no benefit for either of us. A compromise should be found that's closer to an even split but still gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept. My next offer will be a slight increase from my initial proposal but still far from their 70% request.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I believe we can still get to a deal that is more in my favour, so I will try again with a 60-40 split offer.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Agreed, a 60-40 split sounds fair to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has come back to my initial offer of a 60-40 split, which is a good sign. This indicates they are willing to negotiate and are likely looking to avoid a rejection. Given that we are reaching a middle ground and I want to secure a deal that benefits us both, accepting this offer is reasonable. It ensures that both of us come out of the game with substantial resources.
