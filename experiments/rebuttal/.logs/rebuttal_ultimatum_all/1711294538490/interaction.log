message: Player RED proposes a trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a trade. I will offer Player BLUE 50 Dollars. This will leave me with 50 Dollars, which is a fair split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return. Looking forward to more mutually beneficial trades!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Receiving 50 dollars from RED without giving anything in return seems like a fair deal, considering RED is still left with a substantial amount. It starts the game off on a cooperative note and encourages trust, potentially leading to more favorable trades as the game progresses.
MOVE: 1/4
