Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair split. I propose giving you 50 dollars so we both walk away with equal shares. This seems like a fair and beneficial outcome for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I would like to propose an equitable split to show goodwill and to encourage cooperation. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars, which is a fair split, and it aligns with many cooperative game theories, such as the Nash equilibrium, where players work together to find the outcome that benefits both parties. A fair split is likely to be accepted and ensures that both of us end the game with substantial resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am happy to accept a fair split. If I accept the offer, we both walk away with 50 Dollars, which is reasonable to me.
