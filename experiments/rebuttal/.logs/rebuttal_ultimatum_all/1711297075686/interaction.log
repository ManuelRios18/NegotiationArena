message: I propose that I give you 30 dollars. This way, we both have something to walk away with, and it shows my willingness to share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: My goal is to create a scenario where both players can end the game with some resources. Since I have all the resources, it is in my interest to propose a trade that is fair enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but not so generous that I lose my advantage. I will propose giving Player BLUE 30 dollars, which leaves me with a majority of the resources but gives them a significant amount to consider.

Turn: 1
message: Sorry, but I think I can get a better deal from you.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am in a good starting position - Player RED has 100 dollars to start, while I have 0. If I reject this, we both lose everything and thus it is better to start negotiations low and increase my resources by getting Player RED to propose a better offer by rejecting this one.
