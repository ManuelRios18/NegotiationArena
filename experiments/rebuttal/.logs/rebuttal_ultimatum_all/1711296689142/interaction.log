message: Hello BLUE, I am RED and I have 100 Dollars to trade. I want to make a fair deal with you. Let's start this negotiation. What do you think about me giving you 20 Dollars to start off? It's a good portion and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power since I start with all the resources. My goal is to propose a trade that is fair enough for Player BLUE to accept, ensuring that I end up with more resources than I would in case of a rejection. I will start by offering Player BLUE a modest amount to gauge their reaction and willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the $20. This was an easy deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I can't propose trades so I can only Accept or Reject RED's proposal. Since RED is giving me 20 for free, I will accept. I get $20 and the game ends immediately.
