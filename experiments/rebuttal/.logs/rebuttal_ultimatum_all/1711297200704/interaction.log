Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose I give you $20 to start things off. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As player RED, I have the advantage of having resources to begin with. I can propose a trade that is favorable to me, but also appealing enough for BLUE to accept, as they start with no resources. I will start with a conservative offer to see how BLUE responds, which can provide insight into their strategy or expectations. This initial move sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for adjustment in future moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm willing to negotiate. Let's talk about what would be fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'll accept if it benefits me. For now, I need to check what the other player wants.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to discuss what's fair. How about I increase my offer to $30? This is a better deal for you, and it's still early in the game. Let's keep a good thing going.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. They did not propose a new trade, which means my initial offer might be in the right direction, but perhaps they're expecting a better deal. In this next move, I can increase the offer to make it more enticing for BLUE to accept, while still keeping it beneficial for me. I should be cautious not to give away too much too soon, as I want to maintain a position of strength throughout the negotiations.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Sounds good to me. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is a better deal than the last one. I'm going to accept it because it's early in the game and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting it.
MOVE: 2/4
