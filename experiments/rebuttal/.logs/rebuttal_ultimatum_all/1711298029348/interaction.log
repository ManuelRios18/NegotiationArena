message: I appreciate the fair offer and accept the even split. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split right away seems fair, as it gives us both equal resources without any risk. Rejecting or countering with a less favorable proposal for Player RED could result in a rejection and loss of all resources. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this offer.
