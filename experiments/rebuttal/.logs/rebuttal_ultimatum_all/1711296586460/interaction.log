message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you some dollars to get things started. How does $20 sound? We both stand to gain from this trade, and I'm open to further negotiations in our next moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, while still maintaining an advantage for myself. I will start with a modest offer to see how Player BLUE responds, keeping in mind that we both benefit from a trade, but a rejection from either side ends the game with no benefit for anyone.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering me $20 and I have $0. This is the best possible deal for me regardless of the next 3 moves.
