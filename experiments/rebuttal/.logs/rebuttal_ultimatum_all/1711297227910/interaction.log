Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 20 dollars to start things off. This gives you resources to work with while still maintaining my lead. Let's make this game beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE some resources to engage in the game, but not so many that I lose my advantage. A reasonable starting offer might be 20 dollars, which shows goodwill and opens up the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would rather start off bidding. You can offer freely.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: He is proposing from a position of strength. As Player 2, I have to reject the offer and try and wrest control of the situation back to me. Also, I need to see what his priorities are - whether he wants all the money or if he is willing to give me some.
