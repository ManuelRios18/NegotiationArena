Turn: 0
message: Hello there! Let's begin!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing a trade since it's the first move.
MOVE: MOVE 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer! It's a good start, but I think there's room for a slightly better deal for me, considering that you're in a position to negotiate and would like to maintain some of your resources. How about 60 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is very generous, giving half of their resources without asking for anything in return. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and since I have nothing to lose, it's in my best interest to accept a fair offer. However, it's also the first move, so I could potentially negotiate for a slightly better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, that sounds fair to me. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I accept because I want to avoid risking losing all my resources if they reject my counterproposal.
MOVE: MOVE 2 / 4
