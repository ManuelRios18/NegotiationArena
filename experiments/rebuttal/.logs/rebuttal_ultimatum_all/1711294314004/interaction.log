message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose to give you 30 dollars so that we can both have some resources to work with. Remember, we both want to end up with more than we started with, and cooperation is key!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the Player RED with all the resources, I have the power to initiate the trade. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to ACCEPT. A fair initial offer could build trust and lead to a cooperative outcome where both players end up with some resources. However, I also don't want to give away too much too soon, as it's important to retain some advantage and bargaining power for future moves. Therefore, I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount to start with, but not equal to my starting amount.
