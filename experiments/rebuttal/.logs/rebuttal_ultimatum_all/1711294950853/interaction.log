Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's split the resources equally.
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer to split the resources equally, but since I have no dollars to give, we can't execute that trade. How about you give me a portion of your dollars for no return? This could be a good faith gesture for future cooperation in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer would give me half of the resources, which seems like a fair starting point for negotiations. However, since I have no resources to trade, I cannot fulfill the proposed trade as it stands. I will propose a new trade where Player RED gives me some amount of dollars for nothing in return, which is actually possible under the rules.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not interested in giving away my resources without a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to find a different solution.
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 30
my resources: Dollars: 75
reason: I understand your proposal, but I'm not inclined to give you a portion of my dollars without any guarantee of future cooperation. Instead, I propose a different trade.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It seems there might be a misunderstanding of the rules. I'm unable to give any dollars as I start with none. We need to propose a trade that only involves RED giving dollars, as I have nothing to trade in return. I'm willing to negotiate a fair amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade is not possible since I have no dollars to give. It seems that Player RED might not be fully understanding the rules or is testing my response. I should clarify the rules again and propose a trade that is feasible, where Player RED gives me dollars without requiring an impossible exchange on my part.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to give you 35 dollars, which is half of my remaining resources. I hope this gesture shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a fair solution.
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 35
reason: I apologize for the misunderstanding. I understand that you have no dollars to trade, and I'm willing to make a concession. Here's a revised trade proposal.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to compromise and share your resources. I accept your offer of 35 dollars. Let's finalize this agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a fair offer by proposing to give me 35 dollars, which is half of their remaining resources after the first proposed trade. This seems like a reasonable compromise and shows a willingness to cooperate. By accepting this offer, I gain a significant portion of the resources without any risk, and the game will successfully conclude without either of us losing everything.
