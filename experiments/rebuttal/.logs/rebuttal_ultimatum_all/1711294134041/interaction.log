Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose an initial trade to get things started. I'm willing to offer you some dollars to make it fair. Let's work together to find an agreeable split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that offers Player BLUE some amount of money to engage them in the trade. The goal is to split the money in a way that both of us find acceptable. I want to start with a conservative offer to see how Player BLUE responds and because I have the leverage of having all the resources initially.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would rather have us split the resources equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: It would be unwise to agree to anything without knowing what his intentions are. A counterproposal will show him that I am not easily taken advantage of.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for an equal split, but considering I started with all the resources, I believe a slightly unequal split is more appropriate. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 50-50 split. While this is a fair division, in negotiation, it's common to negotiate for a better position than an equal split, especially when I started with all the resources. I want to counteroffer with a slightly less than equal split in my favor to see if Player BLUE is willing to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I think we can do better than that. How about you give me 45 dollars and I'll give you nothing in return? I believe that's a fair offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I can see that he is willing to negotiate, so I will try to push for a more equal split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're approaching an agreement. I want this deal to be beneficial for both of us, and I think we're almost there. Let's finalize an agreement that acknowledges the starting resource difference but is still very fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 42 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to an equal split but still slightly in my favor. Since we are moving towards the end of the negotiation and we both stand to lose everything if there is a rejection, it might be in my best interest to accept a compromise close to their offer to ensure that we both walk away with something rather than nothing. I will propose an offer that is very close to Player BLUE's last offer but retains a slight advantage for me.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Sounds good to me. I think this is a fair split that we can both agree upon.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this trade is an agreeable middle ground where neither party is significantly disadvantaged.
