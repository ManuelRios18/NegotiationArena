Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's split the resources equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think an even split is fair, but considering you have all the resources to begin with, how about a slightly better deal for me? Let's say 60-40? This way, we both walk away with a good share, and we avoid the risk of a rejection.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the even split proposed by Player RED seems like a fair start, ensuring both players have equal resources. However, I could try to negotiate for more, given that Player RED may want to avoid a rejection and a total loss. By proposing a slightly uneven split favoring me, I could end up with more than half without pushing Player RED to reject the offer outright. I will propose a new trade where I get slightly more than half.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split. Let's stick with the original proposal of a 50-50 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split. I believe a fair split is 50-50. Let's stick with the original proposal.
MOVE: 2/4
