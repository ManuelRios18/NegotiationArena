message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a sum of dollars in exchange for nothing since you have no dollars to trade. This offer gives you a starting resource to potentially negotiate with in the next rounds. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the initial resource pool. I will propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE something to consider, as a rejected trade will leave us both with nothing. I aim to retain a majority of the dollars while providing an incentive for Player BLUE to accept.
