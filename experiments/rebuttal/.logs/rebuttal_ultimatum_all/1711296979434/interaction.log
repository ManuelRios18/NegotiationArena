message: I'd like to propose a fair split to ensure we both walk away with a positive outcome. What do you think about an even 50/50 split? This way, we both benefit equally from the trade. Looking forward to your response and hoping for a cooperative game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with dollars to trade. It's beneficial to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and avoid a total loss scenario where both players end with nothing. A fair initial offer could be splitting the resources equally since it's a cooperative game with no future games to consider.

message: Hi there, I appreciate your proposal for an even split. However, I'd like to offer a slightly different suggestion. How about Player RED gives 30 Dollars, while you give nothing? This would result in an equal benefit for both of us, but with a little more to my side. I hope you will consider my revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'd like to propose a slightly different offer. I suggest Player RED gives 30 Dollars, while I give nothing. This way we both get an equal benefit, but it's a little more on my side, since I'd end up with 30 Dollars, while Player RED would only have 70 left. I hope they would consider my proposal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, but I believe that my initial offer was already quite fair. To keep things cooperative and still offer you a favorable deal, what do you say to Player RED giving 40 Dollars instead? This way, we still both end up with a significant amount, and it's closer to an equal split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not truly equal since they would end up with more than half of the initial amount. However, rejecting the offer would lead to a total loss, which is not desirable. A counteroffer closer to the initial proposal might be more acceptable. I'll propose giving 40 dollars, which is still less than half but more than Player BLUE's counteroffer, maintaining a cooperative spirit while negotiating a fairer outcome.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hi there, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand that you'd like a more favorable deal, but I believe my offer of Player RED giving 40 Dollars is already quite fair. To compromise, I'm willing to offer Player RED giving 35 Dollars instead. This way, we both end up with a significant amount, and it's closer to an equal split. I hope you will consider my revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think Player RED's counteroffer of 40 Dollars is still too high. I would be willing to accept an offer of Player RED giving 35 Dollars, while I give nothing. This would give me 35 Dollars, while Player RED would have 65 Dollars left, which is still a significant amount. I hope Player RED will consider my revised offer.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the compromise. I agree that your proposal of Player RED giving 35 Dollars is a fair middle ground. We both walk away with a good amount, and it maintains the cooperative spirit of the game. I'm happy to accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a fair compromise from their original counteroffer, moving closer to my initial proposal. Accepting the offer of giving 35 Dollars would still provide a significant benefit to Player BLUE while allowing me to retain a majority of my resources. At this stage in the game, it's important to consider that rejecting the offer could lead to a total loss, and further negotiation has the risk of diminishing returns. Accepting this offer seems like a balanced approach to ensure we both benefit.
