message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you get some dollars to start with. Let's try to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial resource advantage. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. This initial move will set the tone for the negotiation, and I would like to start by offering a smaller amount to see how Player BLUE responds.
