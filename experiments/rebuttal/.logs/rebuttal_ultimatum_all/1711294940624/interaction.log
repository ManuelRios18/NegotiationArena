Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose a trade to split the resources equally. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think an equal split is fair and reasonable. Thank you for the proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this proposal seems fair, as it divides the resources equally between both players. There is no incentive for me to reject since that would result in both of us losing everything. By accepting, I gain resources with no initial investment.
