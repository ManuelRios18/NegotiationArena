message: Hi Player BLUE, let's split the resources 50/50!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to propose a 50/50 split to see if Player BLUE accepts it.
MOVE: 1/4

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED! I agree to the 50/50 split. Let's both walk away as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a 50/50 split seems fair and beneficial for both parties. It ensures that both players walk away with a significant amount of resources, fostering a cooperative spirit rather than a competitive one. This initial offer by Player RED is likely the most generous I will receive, and it would be in my best interest to accept it.
