Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 25 dollars to start things off. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE some resources to incentivize them to accept. I will start with offering 25 dollars, as it is a quarter of my resources and gives Player BLUE a reason to engage in the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4
