message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade. I propose giving you 40 dollars to help even the playing field and start off our negotiations. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the first move, I would like to propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to start negotiations and see if Player BLUE is willing to cooperate for mutual benefit.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
