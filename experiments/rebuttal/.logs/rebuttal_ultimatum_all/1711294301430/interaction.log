message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make a deal that's beneficial for both of us. I am willing to give you some of my dollars to start things off. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it's in my interest to initiate a trade that is favorable to me, but not so one-sided that Player BLUE will reject it outright. I want to propose a trade that shows goodwill and opens the floor for negotiation, potentially leading to an acceptable deal for both players. I'll start by offering a small amount to see how Player BLUE responds.
