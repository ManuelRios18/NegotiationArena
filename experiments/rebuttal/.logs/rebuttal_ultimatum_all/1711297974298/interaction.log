Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: How about we start playing?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a very low offer so that Player BLUE can start making offers that I can then counter-offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Let's aim for a more balanced split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too low, considering they have $100 and I have $0. I want to negotiate a better deal that is more equitable. However, I must be careful not to propose something that would lead to a REJECT and end the game with no resources for either player.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I think we can do better than that. How about we split it 50/50?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE wants a more balanced split, so I will propose a new offer that is more balanced. I will offer to give Player BLUE $25 in exchange for nothing. This will give me $75 and give Player BLUE $25. I believe this is a fair offer that Player BLUE will accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4
