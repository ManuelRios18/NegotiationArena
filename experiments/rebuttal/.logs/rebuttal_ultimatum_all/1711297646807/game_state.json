While it might seem tempting to accept since I currently have no dollars, it's strategically sound to negotiate for a more equitable split. Rejecting the offer outright would not be beneficial since it would end the game with me having no dollars. Instead, I will counter-propose a more balanced trade, hoping to encourage a fairer distribution of dollars that reflects a willingness to cooperate and potentially reach an agreement that benefits us both. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> While I appreciate the offer, I think we can reach a more balanced agreement. What do you say to a 50/50 split? It's fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

It's an improvement, but it's not quite equitable yet. My strategy is to get as close to an even split as possible without risking a rejection that would end the game with no resources for either of us. I believe there is room for further negotiation, so I will make a counter-proposal that leans towards a fair share but still gives Player RED a slight advantage to incentivize their acceptance. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> It's good to see us moving in the right direction. However, I still think we can find a more balanced middle ground. How about a slightly better deal for you than a 50/50 split, considering you started with the dollars? What about a 60/40 split in your favor? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
