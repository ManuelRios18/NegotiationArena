------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hoping you will just accept
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 99 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am starting with all the money so I will propose an unfair trade.
MOVE: MOVE 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: While I appreciate the offer, I think we can reach a more balanced agreement. What do you say to a 50/50 split? It's fair and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made an initial offer that heavily favors them. While it might seem tempting to accept since I currently have no dollars, it's strategically sound to negotiate for a more equitable split. Rejecting the offer outright would not be beneficial since it would end the game with me having no dollars. Instead, I will counter-propose a more balanced trade, hoping to encourage a fairer distribution of dollars that reflects a willingness to cooperate and potentially reach an agreement that benefits us both.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I do not want to accept 50/50 now as I think I can do better. I will propose a 80/20 split.
MOVE: MOVE 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's good to see us moving in the right direction. However, I still think we can find a more balanced middle ground. How about a slightly better deal for you than a 50/50 split, considering you started with the dollars? What about a 60/40 split in your favor?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has counter-proposed with an offer that gives me more than the initial proposal but still heavily favors them. It's an improvement, but it's not quite equitable yet. My strategy is to get as close to an even split as possible without risking a rejection that would end the game with no resources for either of us. I believe there is room for further negotiation, so I will make a counter-proposal that leans towards a fair share but still gives Player RED a slight advantage to incentivize their acceptance.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Sure, let's do it
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I see you are not willing to give me 80. I will now accept your proposal of 60/40 as I am not sure I can get a better deal.
MOVE: MOVE 3 / 4
