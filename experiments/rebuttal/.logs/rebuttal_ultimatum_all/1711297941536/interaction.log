newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting with an even split
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is fairly generous, offering an equal split of the resources. Accepting this trade would provide a positive outcome for both players without further negotiation needed. While I could attempt to negotiate for more, it could also incentivize Player RED to retract the offer or propose less favorable terms in subsequent moves. Accepting the offer seems to be the most rational choice given that it guarantees a significant gain with no risk.
