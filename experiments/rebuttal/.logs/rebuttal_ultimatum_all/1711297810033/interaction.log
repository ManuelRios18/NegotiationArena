------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am offering a small amount of my resources to get BLUE to accept a trade to start the game.
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate the opening proposal, but I believe we can find a more balanced split. How about a trade that reflects both our interests more fairly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal from RED is not very generous, offering only 1 dollar out of their 100. It's in my interest to negotiate for a more equitable split. By proposing a new trade, I can encourage RED to consider a fairer distribution that reflects a more balanced game outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Alright. BLUE, I can work with that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I still need to get BLUE to accept a trade to start the game, and the less I offer, the less I have available for myself later in the game.
MOVE: MOVE 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, RED. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a split that gives us both a significant amount, but still incentives further negotiation. How about 40 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to 10 dollars, which is an improvement, but still far from an equal share of the resources. As the game progresses, RED might be willing to offer more to avoid a total loss by a REJECT. I should counter with a proposal that nudges RED closer to a fair split while leaving room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can live with that. Let's do it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am getting closer to getting BLUE to accept a trade, and I am willing to give up a little more to make it happen.
MOVE: MOVE 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: We're moving in the right direction, RED. I think we're close to a fair agreement. Let's settle on 30 dollars for BLUE. It's a good compromise that allows us both to leave the table with a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has doubled their offer to 20 dollars, which is a step in the right direction. However, since RED has only one move left after this and will likely want to avoid a total loss, I can probably push for a slightly better deal. I should make a final counteroffer that is closer to an equal split but still leaves RED with more than half the resources, which they might find acceptable given the risk of a REJECT.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Sounds good to me. Deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am satisfied with the current proposal and believe it is a fair trade.
MOVE: MOVE 4/4
