message: Hey Player BLUE, I think a fair exchange would be if I give you $20.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to make a fair offer that will be accepted.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I agree to the $20 as a good starting point.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since this is the first proposal and a fair starting point, I'm inclined to accept it. However, as the game progresses, I might be able to negotiate a better deal. Accepting $20 now establishes goodwill and opens up the negotiation.
