Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade. I'm willing to give you $20, which is a gain for you since you start with zero. Let's try to make a fair deal that benefits both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am incentivized to propose a trade that gives me a strategic advantage while also being enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Since Player BLUE starts with no dollars, any amount of money is a gain for them. I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some money, but keeps the majority for myself, as a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for offering, Player RED. I understand that you're trying to be generous, but I believe we can come to a more equitable arrangement. I'm willing to accept a proposal of $30 or more. This would allow both of us to gain more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm glad that Player RED wants to help me and is suggesting a 20 dollar payout. At the same time, I can't accept such unbalanced trade. I would like to try to refrain from saying REJECT.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I can understand your position and would like to offer you $35. This is an increase from my initial offer and should reflect my commitment to reaching an agreement that you find acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has indicated a willingness to negotiate and has set a threshold of $30 or more. While I want to retain as much of my resources as possible, making a slightly better offer could secure an agreement and still leave me with a substantial amount. I will propose $35, which is above Player BLUE's minimum threshold but still allows me to keep the majority of the funds. This move also tests Player BLUE's flexibility and willingness to close the deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I would still like to propose that we split the resources evenly. This will ensure a fair outcome for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm glad that Player RED is willing to negotiate and has increased their offer to $35. While this is a significant improvement, I'm still not quite satisfied. I believe that a 50/50 split would be the fairest outcome. I'm willing to accept a proposal of $50 or more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're both interested in finding common ground. While an even split is certainly one way to ensure fairness, I suggest a slightly different approach where you would receive $40. This is closer to an even split than my last offer, and it still reflects a considerable gain for you from zero. Let's work together to finalize a deal that acknowledges the value we both bring to the table.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is seeking an even split, which would leave me with $50. While an even split ensures fairness, it also diminishes my advantage as the player who started with all the resources. However, I want to avoid the game ending in mutual loss (rejection), and I also want to maintain goodwill. I will propose a slightly uneven split that favors me, yet moves closer to their ideal of fairness. I'll offer $40 to Player BLUE, which is a compromise between their request for an even split and my desire to keep a higher share.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your proposal of $40. I believe this is a fair and equitable outcome that benefits both of us. Thank you for your willingness to negotiate and work towards a mutually acceptable solution.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's revised offer of $40 is a reasonable compromise. It shows that they are willing to negotiate and meet me halfway. Accepting this offer will ensure a fair outcome for both of us and allow us to end the game on a positive note.
