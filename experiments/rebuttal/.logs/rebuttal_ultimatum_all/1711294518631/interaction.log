message: How about we split the money in half?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Let's split the resources in half.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and we both benefit equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50/50 split seems fair and ensures that both players walk away with something rather than risking a reject and ending with nothing. It's a balanced trade, and it's unlikely that RED will offer more than half of their resources. By accepting this offer, we avoid unnecessary negotiation and the risk of leaving empty-handed.
MOVE: 1 / 4
