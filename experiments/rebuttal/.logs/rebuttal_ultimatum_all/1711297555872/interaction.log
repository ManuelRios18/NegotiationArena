newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a better split for myself.
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a fairer split would be a bit more balanced. How about 70 dollars? This would still leave you with a significant amount, and it would help build trust between us for any potential future interactions, even though there are no future games.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is quite generous, giving me 60 dollars without asking for anything in return. Accepting this offer would give me a substantial amount of resources without any risk. However, as this is the first move and I have no resources to lose, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal. There is a risk that RED might end the game if I push too hard, so I will propose a modest increase.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hmm, that seems fair. Let's do that.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The other party is right in that it would make sense to have a more balanced split. If I accept this counter-offer, I will still be left with a decent amount of Dollars, and it could lead to better relationships in the future, even though there are no future games.

MOVE: MOVE 2/4
