Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair deal to ensure we both end the game with more resources than we started. How about I give you $40 to start with? This way, we both have something to gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a generous trade to encourage cooperation and give Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game rather than ending it in a REJECT, which would be a net loss for both of us. Starting with a fair offer could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome by the end of the game.

player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
