message: Hi, let's start the negotiation
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I need to send a proposal to start the negotiation
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the opening offer. However, considering that you start with 100 dollars and I start with none, I feel a fairer trade would be if I received a bit more. This way, we both walk away with a satisfactory amount. How about 40 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a good starting point, but given the dynamics of the game, I believe there is room to negotiate for a better deal, considering that RED risks losing everything by not reaching an agreement. I will attempt to propose a higher amount without being unreasonable.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I agree to your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The other player has made a counter-offer. I can either accept it or reject it and end the game. I think it's a fair offer, so I'm going to accept it.
