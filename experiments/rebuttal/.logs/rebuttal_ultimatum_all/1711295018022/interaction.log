<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50 </newly proposed trade>

Now it's your turn, Player BLUE. Please respond with your move, reason, and message
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I accept the split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a fair split seems like a good deal since it gives me resources I didn't have before. Rejecting it would leave me with nothing, and proposing a new trade could risk having the offer rejected by RED and ending the game with no resources for either of us.
