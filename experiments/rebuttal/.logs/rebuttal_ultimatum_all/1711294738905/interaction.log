------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's find a fair split. I propose giving you $40 to start things off. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with resources. My goal is to end the game with a favorable split of the dollars while incentivizing Player BLUE to accept the trade. I will start by proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE a decent share, showing willingness to negotiate, but still keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you want to start with a fair split, but I cannot accept this proposal as it would leave me with no resources. I will propose a new trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 20
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I cannot accept this proposal as it would leave me with no resources. I need to propose a trade that would give me some resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: It seems there might be a misunderstanding. You don't have any dollars to offer in the trade. However, I'm willing to give you a better deal. How about I give you $50? This way, you get half of what I started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE cannot give dollars as they started with zero, so their counterproposal doesn't make sense. They might be trying to signal that they want a more equal split, or it could be a misunderstanding of the rules. I'll clarify the rules and offer a slightly better deal, moving towards a more equal split without giving away too much too soon.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for offering a better deal, but I cannot accept it. I need to propose a trade that would give me some resources. I'll make a new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate the improved offer, but I still cannot accept it. I have no resources to offer in return for the $50, and it would not be a fair trade. I need to propose a trade that would give me some resources.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're interested in an equal split. Let's settle this amicably. I propose giving you half of my dollars, which is $50. This is a fair split, and I hope you'll accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has again proposed a trade that doesn't align with the rules since they don't have any dollars to trade. It seems they are aiming for an equal split. I want to close the deal on this turn to avoid any risks associated with the final move, where Player BLUE can only accept or reject. Iâ€™ll propose an even split to ensure acceptance and avoid the game ending with a reject.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, but I need to have some resources to continue playing. I'll make a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still cannot accept this proposal. I need to have some resources to continue playing the game, and accepting this trade would leave me with nothing. I'll make a counteroffer.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but you cannot offer dollars you don't have. To finalize our game and ensure we both walk away with resources, I will offer you $60. This is a generous offer, and my final proposal. Please accept so we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still not adhering to the game rules; they cannot offer dollars because they started with none. This is the last move I can make a proposal on, and I need to ensure that the game doesn't end with both of us losing everything. I have to make a proposal that Player BLUE is likely to accept. Considering their previous attempts, they seem to want more than the $50 I offered. I'll propose a slightly better split in my favor, which still gives them a significant amount, hoping to incentivize acceptance.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I cannot accept this proposal. I need to have some resources to continue playing the game. Unfortunately, I must reject this offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I understand your perspective, but I cannot accept this proposal. I have consistently requested a trade that would give me some resources to continue playing the game, and this proposal would leave me with nothing. I'm willing to compromise, but I cannot accept a trade that would leave me empty-handed.
