message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fair trade. Let's find a balance that benefits us both. Here's my initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade that shows goodwill but also leaves room for negotiation. I should start with a proposal that is not too generous, as I want to keep some leverage for future moves and encourage Player BLUE to engage in the trading game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the offer. I'm happy to consider it, but I'd like to see if we can work towards a more balanced split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm a little hesitant to accept the offer right away. I'd like to see if we can reach a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from our initial proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a lower offer than I initially proposed. Given that I started with a relatively generous amount, I can afford to come down a bit to show a willingness to negotiate, yet I want to propose a higher amount than BLUE's counter to find a middle ground. I also want to maintain the advantage as we progress through the moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4

message: I think this is a fair deal, Player RED. I'm happy to accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is a fair offer from Player RED. Accepting it will give me a quarter of the total resources, which is a good outcome for me.
MOVE: 2/4
