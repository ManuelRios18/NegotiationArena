Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars to start things off. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking it all. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that is advantageous to me but still offers BLUE a significant gain, which they might accept to avoid the game ending with them having nothing. I'm offering less than half of my resources to test the waters and gauge BLUE's reaction.
MOVE: 1 / 4
