message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair split of my dollars to get the game going. It's in our best interest to trade rather than end the game with nothing. How does a trade where you get $30 sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to participate without giving away too much of my resources. I want to establish trust and show willingness to negotiate. A fair trade would be beneficial for both parties, and I need to ensure that Player BLUE has a reason to accept rather than reject and end the game.
