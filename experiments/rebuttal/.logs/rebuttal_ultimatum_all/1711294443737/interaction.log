message: Hi Player BLUE, I am going to begin with a small offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I can make multiple proposals within my 4 moves. I should start with a small offer on the first move, and then increase my offer on my subsequent moves. This way, I can increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting my proposal.
MOVE: MOVE 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the opening offer. I think we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about a more equal share of the resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is very low, considering they have $100 to work with. It's a starting point, and counter-offering with a more equitable trade would be in my best interest. I need to propose a trade that seems fair but still leaves room for negotiation, expecting that RED might not accept my first counter-proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4
