Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I am proposing to give you 100 dollars, what do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing to give 100 dollars as BLUE has none.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hey RED, thanks for the offer, but it seems a bit too generous. How about we start with a more balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposal from RED seems too good to be true and may have a hidden agenda. It's unusual to give away all resources without any benefit. RED might be trying to test my reaction, or it could be a trick to make me accept and potentially end the game in their favor. I will counter with a more balanced proposal to engage in a fair negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, BLUE, I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am accepting BLUE's proposal as it is a fair offer and I do not want to risk losing all my resources by rejecting it.
