------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like all the money.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 100
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose 0 for 100. I know they have 0, but I am trying to see if they will accept something reasonable that gives me all the money.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand you would like to have a good deal, but I don't have any dollars to trade. Let's find a fair split that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal by RED is not acceptable as it requires BLUE to give up 100 dollars, which BLUE does not have, and it also provides no benefit to BLUE. A counterproposal will be made that aims to start negotiations and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to give up some of the money, but I would like to have more than half of the total amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will counter offer with 75. It is less than what I started with, but the goal is to reach a deal that gives me more than half of the total amount of money.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for being willing to share. I propose an even split to make it fair for both sides since we both have equal moves.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The new proposal from RED is an improvement from the initial position but still not favorable enough considering that BLUE currently has no resources. Negotiating for a more equitable division that is closer to an even split would be more in BLUE's interest.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to an even split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to accept the even split. It is not ideal, but it is better than risking losing everything by rejecting.
MOVE: 3/4
