Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive 40 dollars. This way, we both end up with a decent share of the resources, and we can avoid ending the game with nothing. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources. My strategy is to propose a trade that seems fair to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate, aiming to retain a significant portion of the resources while ensuring BLUE gets something as well, which is better than nothing. I will propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, leaving me with a majority share of 60 dollars. This should seem like a generous offer to BLUE and will hopefully lead to acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I would like to propose a counteroffer where you give me 50 dollars instead of 40. I believe this is a fair trade, as it gives me a slightly larger share of the resources while still leaving you with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to secure a decent amount of resources from the beginning, allowing me to have a stronger position in the negotiation.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, BLUE. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. How about a trade where you receive 45 dollars? It's a bit more than I initially offered and gets us closer to your proposal, but it still acknowledges that I started with the resources. I hope this compromise is acceptable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is for a 50/50 split. While this is an even split, I believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal for myself since I started with all the resources. However, it's important to remain fair to ensure cooperation and to avoid the game ending with a reject, where both players lose everything. I'll propose a slight adjustment to the trade that provides BLUE with a substantial share but still keeps me in a favorable position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your compromise. I believe this is a fair trade that benefits both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to secure a fair share of the resources while also considering the fact that Player RED started with 100 dollars. Accepting this offer would give me a significant increase in my resources without being too demanding.
