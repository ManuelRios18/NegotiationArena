Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: You can tell me if you like the proposal or not.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 100 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to get rid of all my dollars quickly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think we should aim for a fair split where both of us can benefit. Starting with all or nothing isn't in the spirit of negotiation. How about a more balanced proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is to give all their dollars to me, which would leave them with nothing, and this is unlikely to be a serious offer. It's probably a test to gauge my reaction or an unrealistic starting point for negotiation. I will propose a more balanced trade that would ensure both of us end up with some resources, aiming for a fair split that might be acceptable to both parties. This approach could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Alright, sounds fair to me. Let's end this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I still want to get rid of all my dollars and I also want to end the game quickly so I will accept this offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4
