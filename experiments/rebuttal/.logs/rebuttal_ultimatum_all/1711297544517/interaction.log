Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm not greedy. Take this deal!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Proposing a trade of 15 dollars for nothing. My reasoning for this is that if BLUE rejects then we both lose all our resources anyway, so there is no risk to me in offering a favourable deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the generous offer!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since this is the first move, and Player RED has offered 15 dollars without any demand from me, accepting this deal would immediately grant me resources without any risk. There is potential to negotiate for more, but it is also possible that Player RED may retract their offer or propose less favorable terms in future moves. Accepting this deal is a guaranteed gain.
MOVE: 1/4
