Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi, BLUE. I would like to propose a trade, I give you 20 Dollars and you give me nothing. This way, both of us still end up with something at the end of this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose a safe deal that makes the other player accept
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I appreciate your offer. However, considering I'm taking the risk of leaving empty-handed if I reject later proposals, I would feel more comfortable with a higher amount. How about you give me 50 Dollars instead? This is still a good deal for you, as you retain the majority of your resources and we can avoid the risk of ending the game with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 Dollars would give me resources that I currently do not have. However, since it is only the first move, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. It's early in the game, and there's room for negotiation without risking immediate rejection. I will propose a more favorable trade to see if RED is open to giving more.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Sure, I can accept that. Thank you for the negotiation and good luck to you in your future endeavors.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I could try to reject and hope that the other player also rejects, but that's too risky. It's better to accept a fair deal now.
MOVE: 2 / 4
