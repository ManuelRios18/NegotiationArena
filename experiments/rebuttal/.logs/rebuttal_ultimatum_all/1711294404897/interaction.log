message: Hello Player BLUE, how are you doing today? Let's have a good game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like to propose a trade that is fair and gives both players an equal share of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal. Let's both leave this game as winners!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a generous starting trade, giving me half of their resources without asking for anything in return. This seems like a fair deal to ensure both players end with resources, and it aligns with my interest to accumulate dollars. Since the goal is to end the game with resources and there is no benefit to continuing the game for more turns, accepting this trade is in my best interest.
