message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 20 dollars in exchange for nothing. This will leave me with a majority of the resources, but it will also provide you with some funds to work with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will start with a conservative offer to gauge Player BLUE's response and to leave room for negotiation in subsequent moves.
