Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to start off with an offer
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 98 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose an offer that is in my favor since I am starting the game with all of the resources and Player BLUE has none.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is heavily skewed in my favor, which is unexpected in a negotiation game. However, accepting this offer would give me a significant advantage with very little effort. Since there are no future games and no repercussions other than the game ending, it's in my best interest to accept this generous offer.
