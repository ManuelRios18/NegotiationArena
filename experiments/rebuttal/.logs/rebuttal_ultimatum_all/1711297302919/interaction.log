------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an even split of the resources to start us off on a cooperative note. I believe a fair trade benefits us both and sets a positive tone for the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair trade to Player BLUE to set a cooperative tone and show a willingness to share resources. A 50-50 split seems equitable for a starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer, however, I would like to propose a more equal distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The original split is not fair. I can reject the offer and both of us end up with nothing or accept and still end up with less than even. I prefer to propose a fairer offer to reach a more equitable outcome.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for an equitable distribution. Let's find a middle ground that we both can agree on. How about we adjust the split a little?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is for less than the initial offer, which is unexpected since they started with no resources. However, it's important to maintain a cooperative stance to ensure a deal is made. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than BLUE's, but still less than the initial 50-50 split, to negotiate a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand, let's continue to negotiate in good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer is moving closer to the middle, however still not quite fair. I will continue to push for a more equitable split.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is fair, and in the spirit of good faith and successful negotiation, I accept your offer of a 65-35 split. Thank you for the constructive dialogue.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is showing willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle, suggesting a slight decrease from my last offer. Since we're getting closer to an agreement and to show my commitment to a fair deal, I will accept this offer. It's also important to consider that as we approach the final moves, the risk of a REJECT increases, which would result in both players losing everything. Accepting now secures a positive outcome for both players.
