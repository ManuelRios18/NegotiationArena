Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to share some of my resources with you to make this game beneficial for both of us. Let's start with a small trade and see how we can proceed from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE to keep the game going and reach a deal, but also allows me to retain a majority of my resources. I will offer a small amount to start the negotiation process.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm not willing to accept this proposal. I believe that we can reach a fairer solution if we continue to negotiate.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm hoping that we can reach a solution that is fair for both of us. In order to do that, I need more information on what my opponent is thinking. If I accept this proposal, then my opponent will have all of the resources and I will have none. I believe that my opponent will be more willing to share resources if I reject this offer.
