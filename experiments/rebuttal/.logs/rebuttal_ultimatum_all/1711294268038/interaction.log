message: Hello BLUE, let's start this off with a fair deal. How about I give you 25 dollars to even things out a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, I have an advantage in this negotiation. To start the game off cooperatively, I will propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to build trust and potentially create a positive scenario for both players. I will offer Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, but not too high as to maintain a strong position and encourage further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4
