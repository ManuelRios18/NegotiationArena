message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade. I'm proposing to give you 20 dollars to get things rolling. This way, we both can benefit from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars to make the game interesting and to build trust. However, I want to maintain a larger share of the dollars to ensure that I end up with more resources than Player BLUE. I propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, which is a fair starting offer.
