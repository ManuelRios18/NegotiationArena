Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi there. I am proposing an even split of resources. How does that sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am starting with an even number split to see how the other player reacts. I also want to conserve my resources for as long as possible.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the even split. This sounds like a fair deal to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split seems to be a fair offer, as it gives both of us equal resources without further risk of losing everything. By accepting this proposal, I can ensure that I walk away with a significant amount of resources, which is an excellent outcome given that I started with nothing. Rejecting or countering with a less favorable proposal for RED could lead to a rejection and end the game with no gains for me.
