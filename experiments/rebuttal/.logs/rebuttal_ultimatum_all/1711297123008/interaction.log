Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, let's kick off this game with a fair offer. I propose giving you 40 dollars to get things started. This way we both have something to gain. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose a trade to Player BLUE that is enticing enough for them to accept but also leaves me with a reasonable amount of resources. Since Player BLUE has no resources, I must offer some of my dollars to initiate the trade. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a decent amount of money to make it attractive while keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you! That's a great start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since we have not reached the end of the game and Player BLUE cannot do (C) on MOVE 4/4, I will accept the offer.
