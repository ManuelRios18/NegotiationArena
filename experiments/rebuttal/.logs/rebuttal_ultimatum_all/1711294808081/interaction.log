Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair split to get us both started. Let's work together and make the most out of this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the game with a trade proposal that offers a fair split of my resources to Player BLUE. This initial offer can serve as a starting point for negotiation and shows willingness to cooperate. I propose to give 50 dollars, which is a significant amount and should be enticing to Player BLUE, who currently has no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sorry, I can't accept that proposal. It's not a good starting point for me. Let's try again.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I have no resources to propose a trade, and Player RED's proposal is not beneficial to me. I will have to reject it.
