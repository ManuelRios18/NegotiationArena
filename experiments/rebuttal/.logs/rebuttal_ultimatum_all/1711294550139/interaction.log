message: We can both benefit from this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing a trade that gives me a fair share of the resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept the trade of 50 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is a split of 50 dollars which is quite generous. Accepting this offer would result in an immediate gain for me without any risk of losing everything. There's a possibility of negotiating for a better split, but it also comes with the risk of Player RED rejecting the counter-proposal and ending the game. Given that I started with no resources, accepting the offer seems like the safest and most beneficial choice.
