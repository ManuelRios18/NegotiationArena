Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am proposing to give you nothing for half of your total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like more than half.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal doesn't make sense as I have no dollars to trade. Let's start with a fair offer. How about you give me 10 dollars to create some balance and trust for the subsequent moves?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from RED is not fair or rational, as it asks for half of my non-existent resources for nothing in return. It's a non-starter and doesn't require further consideration. My counteroffer will be more reasonable and will aim to create a balanced trade between us.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ok, that sounds fair.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I can accept this and then propose a more fair split on the next move.
MOVE: 2/4
