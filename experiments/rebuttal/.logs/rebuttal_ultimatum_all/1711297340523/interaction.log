Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Move 1
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 0 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 99
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue has no dollars to trade. I suggest a proposal to transfer all his dollars to me
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That proposal seems rather one-sided, don't you think? How about we start with a more balanced approach that respects the value of cooperation?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The current proposal from RED is obviously unfair, as it would leave me with nearly all of RED's resources while giving almost nothing in return. This is not a good starting point for negotiation. I will propose a more balanced trade to encourage cooperation and move towards an agreement that benefits both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Move 2
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 99
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: His proposal is not balanced either. Both players need to get something out of this or else there is not point in continuing. I counter-propose with 30 dollars.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: We're getting closer, but let's find a fair middle ground. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable offer that benefits us both equally. What do you think about an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The new proposal from RED is still skewed heavily in my favor, which doesn't make for a fair trade. It's important to aim for a more equal split that would be acceptable to both players. I will counter with a proposal that splits the resources more evenly, providing an incentive for RED to accept.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Move 3
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: A 50/50 split is fair, since both players get an equal portion of the total resources. I accept this proposal.
MOVE: 3/4
