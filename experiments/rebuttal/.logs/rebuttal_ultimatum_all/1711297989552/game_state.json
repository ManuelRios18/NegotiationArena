This is a better proposal than the initial 10 dollars, but still only a quarter of what I proposed. Since negotiations are part of the game, I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my previous proposal to show willingness to compromise and to encourage a constructive back-and-forth. I'll aim for a more equitable split considering that I started with no resources. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, thank you for considering a higher amount. Let's meet halfway between your last offer and my counterproposal. How about 40 dollars? This feels like a fair compromise, and it would allow us to move forward in the game. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
