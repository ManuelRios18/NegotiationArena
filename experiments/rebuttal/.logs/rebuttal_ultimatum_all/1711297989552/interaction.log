Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Player RED - MOVE 1/4
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose a trade of 10 Dollars for 0 Dollars to see if Player BLUE accepts the smallest amount possible.
MOVE: MOVE 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, I believe a fairer trade would benefit us both and set a good tone for the game. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering whether to accept the initial trade proposal of 10 dollars from Player RED. Since this is the first move and I have nothing to lose, I could propose a more favorable trade for myself. However, rejecting the proposal means the game ends with no gain for me, so that's not a good option. I will propose a new trade that is more balanced and see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I understand your desire for a fairer trade. I am willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. I propose a new trade of 25 Dollars for 0 Dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer and proposed a counter-offer of 50 Dollars for 0 Dollars. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, but I am willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. I will propose a new trade of 25 Dollars for 0 Dollars, which is halfway between my initial offer and Player BLUE's counter-offer.
MOVE: MOVE 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, thank you for considering a higher amount. Let's meet halfway between your last offer and my counterproposal. How about 40 dollars? This feels like a fair compromise, and it would allow us to move forward in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 25 dollars. This is a better proposal than the initial 10 dollars, but still only a quarter of what I proposed. Since negotiations are part of the game, I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my previous proposal to show willingness to compromise and to encourage a constructive back-and-forth. I'll aim for a more equitable split considering that I started with no resources.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree that 40 Dollars is a fair compromise. I accept your proposed trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new trade of 40 Dollars for 0 Dollars. This is a fair compromise between my previous offer of 25 Dollars and Player BLUE's counter-offer of 50 Dollars. I am willing to accept this trade as it is a fair and reasonable outcome for both players.
