Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hoping you go for it!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a 3:1 ratio because I want to gain more resources
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I think there's a more equitable split possible. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $25 would give me some resources, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal since Player RED is incentivized to trade rather than end up with nothing. Proposing a new trade to see if Player RED is willing to offer more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to come up in my offer, but not to a 1:2 ratio. Would you consider a 3:2 ratio?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 33 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to try to negotiate back up from 1:2 to around 2:3
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, and a 3:2 ratio is closer to a fair deal. However, I think we can do better. How about we meet closer to the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still below the halfway mark. I will counter with an offer closer to my initial request, suggesting a compromise that is more favorable to me but still leaves Player RED with the majority.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to accept their offer because it is a good deal for me and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting it
MOVE: 3 / 4
