newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose a new trade that includes giving Player BLUE  more Dollars in order to entice them to say YES
MOVE: MOVE 2/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I'm happy to accept the 60 Dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a trade that gives me 60 Dollars for nothing in return. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for me as it gives me resources without any cost. However, because this is the first move and I have negotiating power, I could attempt to propose a counteroffer to see if RED is willing to give more. But this might also risk RED rejecting and ending the game with no gains for either side. Considering it's a generous offer already, it might be best to accept.
