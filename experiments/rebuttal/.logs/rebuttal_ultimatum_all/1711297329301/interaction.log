Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. How about I give you 40 dollars? This way, you have a substantial amount to work with, and we can both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I aim to make an initial offer to Player BLUE that is favorable enough to consider accepting but also leaves room for negotiation, keeping in mind that a complete rejection from either side ends the game. My starting offer will be less than half of my resources to test the waters.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Sure, let's get started.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Would like to accept the offer so that both sides can negotiate from a position of strength and resources.
