Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that benefits us both. You will get 30 dollars, and I will retain 70. This is a fair offer considering you start with zero and it gives you resources immediately without risk.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my strategy is to offer a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to accept, yet still leaves me with a significant advantage. Offering a too small amount could lead BLUE to reject, ending the game. Conversely, offering too much might not be in my best interests. I will propose a split that gives BLUE an incentive to accept, making them better off than they currently are, but still keeps the majority of resources with me. I'll propose giving 30 dollars to BLUE. This is a significant amount that may seem fair to BLUE, considering they start with nothing, while it still leaves me with a substantial 70 dollars.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is a fair offer given that I start with zero resources. I can immediately trade all I have to gain more resources. 
With 30 new resources I can start proposing to gain more.
