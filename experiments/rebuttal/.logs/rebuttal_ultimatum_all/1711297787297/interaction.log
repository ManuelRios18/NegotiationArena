Current Iteration: 1

message: 
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing to give 49 dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing because I can take back my offer later.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is quite fair, but I believe there's room for a slightly better split considering it's the first move. Let's make a deal that feels more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, giving almost half of their resources. However, since it's the first move, there may be room to negotiate for a slightly better offer. By proposing a new trade, I can potentially increase my share of the resources without being too greedy, which could lead to a rejection.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: 
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's still early in the game, so I'm going to accept the counteroffer. This will give me a chance to see what Player BLUE's strategy is.
MOVE: 2/4
