newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Starting with 1/4 of my resources to determine if player BLUE accepts it
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe a fairer split would be slightly more in my favor, considering you start with all the resources. Would you consider giving 35 dollars? This still leaves you with the majority and ensures that we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the offer from Player RED. As I start with no dollars, any positive amount is a gain for me. However, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, as it is in Player RED's interest to avoid a REJECT and lose all their dollars. I will attempt to propose a slightly higher amount, but not so high as to push Player RED towards a REJECT. If they decline and propose a lower amount, I can still accept it in my next move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Sure.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to end this soon as possible so that both of us can walk away with something.
