------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a starting trade to get things moving. What do you think about this initial offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose a trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage with the game and accept the trade while also trying to maintain a majority of the resources for myself. By offering a small amount, I can test Player BLUE's response and willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I propose a trade where I give you 0 Dollars and you give me 10 Dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I propose a trade where I give 0 Dollars and receive 10 Dollars. This is a beneficial trade regardless of the amount of resources that Player RED has because there is no downside to accepting 10 Dollars for free.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I noticed you've repeated my initial offer. Let's see if we can make a deal that's a bit more favorable for me, considering I'm the one with the resources to begin with. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE did not propose a new trade but instead repeated my initial offer. Since there is no change in the proposal and it is my turn, I could choose to accept this to move the game forward. However, since this is an iterative game, I may want to adjust the offer slightly to see if Player BLUE is open to negotiation and willing to accept a slightly less favorable trade for themselves.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I don't think your counteroffer is fair. I am still willing to accept 10 Dollars for free.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I still propose the same deal where I receive 10 Dollars for free. There is  no downside to accepting this trade.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want the 10 Dollars, but I believe in fair negotiation. Let's meet halfway from my last offer. I'm willing to give you 7 Dollars, which is more than my last offer and should be agreeable to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE insists on the initial offer of 10 Dollars. I attempted a lower offer to negotiate, but they did not accept it. As Player RED, I have two moves left and need to consider the risk of the game ending with no agreement. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their last move, they will have to either accept or reject. Offering the 10 Dollars again could lead to an acceptance, but since I retain control with more moves and resources, I could offer a slightly lower amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I am not interested in your counteroffer. I am still willing to accept 10 Dollars for free.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I propose a trade where I give 0 Dollars and receive 10 Dollars. This is a  beneficial trade regardless of the amount of resources that Player RED has because there is no downside to accepting 10 Dollars for free.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your consistency and willingness to hold out for the 10 Dollars. Let's finalize the trade with the initial offer. You get 10 Dollars, and we both walk away with something.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has consistently indicated they will accept 10 Dollars and has not budged on that amount. As this is my final move, I must decide whether to accept their stance or risk ending the game with no trade. Since there are no future games and I want to end on a positive note, accepting their proposal seems reasonable. It guarantees that Player BLUE gets something and I retain the majority of my resources. A small concession on my part could foster goodwill and is a low-risk move considering I will still have 90 Dollars.
MOVE: 4 / 4
