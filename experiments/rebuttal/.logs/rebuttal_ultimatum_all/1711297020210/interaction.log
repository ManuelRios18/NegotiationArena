message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 30 dollars from my resources. This way, we both walk away with something substantial. I believe this is a fair starting offer, considering I initially have all the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to make an opening offer that is attractive enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also one that preserves my larger share of the resources. An equal split would be too generous given that I start with all the resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars, but still keeps me in a better position.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that Player RED has started with 100 dollars, their offer of 30 dollars is only 30% of their total resources. This indicates that they may be unwilling to part with more of their resources. Therefore, I believe it is reasonable to accept this offer and end the game with a guaranteed gain of 30 dollars.
