Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose that I give you $40, leaving me with $60. This way, we both walk away with something. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage since I start with all the resources. I aim to make a proposal that is fair to encourage cooperation and ensure that both players end the game with some resources. A 50-50 split may seem equitable, but I might propose a slightly less balanced trade initially to leave room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think your proposal is fair and I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I should accept this proposal. By accepting, I will gain $40 and lose nothing, since I currently have $0.
