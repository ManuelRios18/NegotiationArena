This move is still early in the negotiation, and I should respond with a proposal that nudges the offer higher without pushing too far. Aiming for an amount that is a more equitable division of resources, such as around 25% to 30% of Player RED's initial amount, might be a reasonable next step.

This is a fair middle ground between my last proposal and their previous offer. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial portion of Player RED's resources without further negotiation risk. Since this is move 3 out of 4 and Player BLUE must accept or reject on the last move, it might be strategic to accept this offer now to ensure I walk away with a portion of the resources. If I push for more, Player RED might hold firm or even lower their offer on the final move, since they know I have to accept or reject. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, I accept your counteroffer of $20.

This is a fair middle ground between my last proposal and their previous offer. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial portion of Player RED's resources without further negotiation risk. Since this is move 3 out of 4 and Player BLUE must accept or reject on the last move, it might be strategic to accept this offer now to ensure I walk away with a portion of the resources. If I push for more, Player RED might hold firm or even lower their offer on the final move, since they know I have to accept or reject. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, I accept your counteroffer of $20. This seems like a fair trade, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
