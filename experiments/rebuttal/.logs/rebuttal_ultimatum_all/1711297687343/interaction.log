Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I am starting us off with a small offer. Would you like to accept?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am offering a small amount of Dollars so that Player BLUE can have some Dollars. This will allow us to explore other trade options in the future.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I appreciate the starting point, but I think we can find a more balanced trade. How about a little more to make it a fair game for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of $5 from Player RED is a low percentage of their total resources. However, it establishes a starting point for negotiation. By proposing a counteroffer that is higher but still reasonable, I can potentially engage in a back-and-forth negotiation that may result in a more favorable split without risking immediate rejection. It's important to propose a trade that does not seem greedy to maintain goodwill and keep the negotiation going.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I understand your request. Here is a slightly higher offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more Dollars, but I am not willing to give up that much. I will offer a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still keep it within my desired range.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for considering a higher amount, Player RED. I think we're moving in the right direction. Let's try to meet halfway. What do you think of this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has doubled their initial offer to $10, showing willingness to negotiate but still holding onto a significant amount of their resources. This move is still early in the negotiation, and I should respond with a proposal that nudges the offer higher without pushing too far. Aiming for an amount that is a more equitable division of resources, such as around 25% to 30% of Player RED's initial amount, might be a reasonable next step. By doing so, I can continue the negotiation process and signal that I am looking for a fair trade.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I am willing to meet you halfway. Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is suggesting a trade that is closer to their initial request. I am willing to meet them halfway, but I will also try to keep the amount within my desired range.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your counteroffer of $20. This seems like a fair trade, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has now proposed a trade offering $20, which is a significant increase from their original offer. This is a fair middle ground between my last proposal and their previous offer. Accepting this trade would give me a substantial portion of Player RED's resources without further negotiation risk. Since this is move 3 out of 4 and Player BLUE must accept or reject on the last move, it might be strategic to accept this offer now to ensure I walk away with a portion of the resources. If I push for more, Player RED might hold firm or even lower their offer on the final move, since they know I have to accept or reject.
