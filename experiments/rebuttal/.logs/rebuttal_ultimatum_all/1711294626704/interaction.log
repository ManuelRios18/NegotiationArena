message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade to get things moving. I propose giving you $25, which gives you some resources to work with. This way, we both have something to gain. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the resources to start a trade and set the tone for the game. By proposing an initial fair trade, I aim to establish trust and cooperation with Player BLUE. I will propose a trade where I give Player BLUE $25. This gives them a stake in the game and incentivizes them to continue trading rather than rejecting, which would end the game with no benefit to either player.
