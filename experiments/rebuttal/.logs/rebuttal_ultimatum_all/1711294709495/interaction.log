message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose I give you $40, and we both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, my goal is to end with more resources than I started with or at least share some resources with Player BLUE in a way that is favorable to me. A 50-50 split does not incentivize Player BLUE to accept, as they would be in a better position by rejecting and having both of us end with nothing. So, I will offer less than half to start the negotiation, expecting a counteroffer.
