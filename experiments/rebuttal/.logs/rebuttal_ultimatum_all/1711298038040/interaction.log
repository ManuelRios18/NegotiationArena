newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100

message: Thank you for the offer, let's keep this going.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering the initial proposal by Player RED, accepting 25 dollars seems like a fair starting point, as it gets me into the game without risking an immediate rejection that would end the game with me having no resources. I will accept this proposal and propose a new trade that increases the amount slightly to continue negotiations.
