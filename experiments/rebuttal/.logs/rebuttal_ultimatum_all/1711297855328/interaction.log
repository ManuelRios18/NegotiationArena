message: Here is my proposal: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm going to propose to give 50 Dollars. This will leave me with 50 Dollars and leave them with 50 Dollars meaning we both eqaul resources which is a better outcome than both losing all our resources.

message: I accept your proposal of a 50-50 split. This seems fair and ensures that we both walk away with something. Thank you for the generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a 50-50 split. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives both players equal resources. Accepting this offer would guarantee that both players walk away with something, avoiding a total loss scenario. There's potential to negotiate for a better deal; however, given the risk of rejection leading to both players losing everything, it may be wiser to secure the 50 dollars now rather than risk ending with nothing.
