message: Hello, let's start with a simple trade. I'll give you Dollars: 50 if you give me Dollars: 0.
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to establish a baseline for the game.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer. I accept your proposal of 50 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting this initial trade seems reasonable as it provides me with resources I did not have before. RED is providing a fair split, giving away half of their resources without asking for anything in return. This could build trust for subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1/4
