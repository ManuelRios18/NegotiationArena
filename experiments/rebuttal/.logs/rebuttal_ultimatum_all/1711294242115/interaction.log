message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive 50 dollars. This is a fair split and would allow us both to walk away with substantial resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to reach an agreement with Player BLUE that benefits both parties and avoids a total loss of resources. Starting with a fair proposal might encourage cooperation and lead to a successful trade. I propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars, which is a significant amount and shows goodwill, without giving away all of my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi RED, I think your offer is a little too generous. How about we split the difference and you give me 25 dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to start by proposing a small trade to see how RED responds, and potentially get a better deal later on.
MOVE: 1/4

Turn: 0
message: Thanks for the counteroffer, BLUE. I'm happy to accept your proposal of 25 dollars. It's a deal!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is interesting as they're asking for less than what I offered. This is not common in negotiations, but it could be a strategy to seem fair or cooperative. Accepting this offer would leave me with a larger share of the resources, which is beneficial for me. I will accept this trade as it is favorable and ensures that we both end the game with some resources.
