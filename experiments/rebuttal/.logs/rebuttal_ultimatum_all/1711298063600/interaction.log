Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. However, I believe a more equitable distribution would better reflect a fair split given that we both have an equal number of moves. What do you think about an 80-20 split? This way, you retain the majority while still providing a significant portion to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to counteroffer with a proposal that is more favorable to me, aiming to get a better split of the dollars, but I also want to leave room for negotiation so that Player RED doesn't immediately reject.
