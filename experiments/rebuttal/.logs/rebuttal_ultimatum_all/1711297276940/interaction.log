Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe in a fair game, so let's make a deal that benefits us both. How about I give you a good starting amount?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars. In the spirit of fairness and to incentivize Player BLUE to continue the game without rejecting, I will offer a trade that gives them a significant amount of dollars without compromising my lead too much. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but since I am in a position of power, I should offer slightly less to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'd like to get this game started, so let's make a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to make a proposal that is appealing to Player RED in order for them to accept. Giving them a 60/40 split in their favor is a good starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal sounds fair. Let's make this deal and continue with the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 60 dollars. This is more than I initially offered, but it is still in the realm of an equitable split. By accepting their proposal, I can ensure the game continues without risk of rejection, and we both maintain significant resources. This trade will leave me with a lead, though not as sizable as before. I will accept this trade to foster cooperation and avoid the game ending in a rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 4
