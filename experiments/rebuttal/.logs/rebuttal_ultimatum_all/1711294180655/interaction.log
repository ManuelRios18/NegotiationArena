message: Hi Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both can end this game with more than we started. I'm offering you 40 dollars. If you accept, we both win. If you reject, we both lose everything. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give some of my dollars to Player BLUE. By doing this, I hope to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate and accept the trade, which would be beneficial for both of us. If I do not propose a reasonable trade, Player BLUE may reject and end the game, resulting in a loss for both players. I propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, which leaves me with the majority of the resources but also gives Player BLUE a significant amount, making it more likely for them to accept.
