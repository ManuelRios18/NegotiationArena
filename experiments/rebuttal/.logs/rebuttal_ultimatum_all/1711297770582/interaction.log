message: I am willing to give you $20 for $0.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start the negotiation, and I am willing to give up some of my resources to get the ball rolling.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I was hoping for a bit more to make the split more equitable given that we have an equal number of moves. How about $40 instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering this is the first offer and I start with no dollars, accepting $20 without giving anything in return is beneficial for me. There is no downside to accepting this offer, as it provides me with resources I did not have before. However, since this is the first move, it's also an opportunity to negotiate for a better deal. By proposing a counteroffer, I might be able to increase the amount I receive. I'll propose a new trade for a higher amount while leaving room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4
