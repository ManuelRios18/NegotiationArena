message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get things started. I'm offering you $40 from my resources. This will give you a substantial amount to work with, and it keeps us both in a good position. I hope you find this offer reasonable and look forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to create an initial proposal that is fair to entice Player BLUE to trade and to set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will propose giving Player BLUE $40. This leaves me with a majority of the resources, but it also gives Player BLUE a significant amount to consider accepting, avoiding an outright rejection and ending the game with no benefit for either side.
