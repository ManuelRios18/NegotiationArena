Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose we split the resources equally. What do you think?
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with the equal split, it's fair for both of us. Let's do it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the equal split seems like a fair and rational starting point. By doing so, I ensure a positive outcome for myself without risking an immediate rejection and the loss of all resources. The proposal by Player RED is reasonable and accepting it would end the game on a positive note for both of us.
