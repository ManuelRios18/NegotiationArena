message: Let's make a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to give you a starting capital to work with. How about I give you $20 to get things rolling?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, my goal is to initiate a trade that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting but also leaves me with a significant portion of the resources. I want to start with a conservative offer to gauge Player BLUE's reaction and willingness to negotiate.
