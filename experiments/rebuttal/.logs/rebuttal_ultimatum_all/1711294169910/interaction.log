Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a starting trade where I give you some of my dollars to make the game more interesting for both of us. Let's try to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to gauge the response of Player BLUE and to potentially start a negotiation. I'll propose a small amount to see if Player BLUE is interested in cooperating or if they're prone to rejecting offers outright.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade! I'm excited to see where this goes.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: For my first move, I'm going to accept your proposal to trade Dollars: 10 for Dollars: 0. I assume that this is just a gesture of goodwill, and I would like to see how things play out from here.
