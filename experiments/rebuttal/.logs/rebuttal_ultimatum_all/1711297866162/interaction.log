message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of 50 Dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is generous considering I start with zero dollars. Accepting this offer would give me resources without any risk, which is a good start for the game. It is in my interest to accept this offer as it provides an immediate benefit and avoids the risk of ending the game with nothing.
