message: Let's split the resources equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. Iâ€™m happy to accept an equal split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from RED to split the resources equally is advantageous because it guarantees an immediate and fair outcome for both players. Rejecting the offer or proposing another trade could lead to a less favorable situation for me, including the risk of ending up with no resources if RED decides to reject my counterproposal. Therefore, accepting the offer is the rational choice in this situation.
