Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Highest I will accept is 55 Dollars. Could you start there?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Just proposed a ridiculously low offer to get it out of the way so it can't be accepted later.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer, but as you mentioned, you would be willing to accept giving up to 55 Dollars. Let's find a middle ground. How about 50 Dollars to start off? This would be fair for both of us and leave room for negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The starting offer from Player RED is far below the maximum they're willing to accept, which is 55 Dollars. A counteroffer closer to that amount is reasonable, considering the risk of immediate rejection is low at this early stage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Happy to meet you half way but if I do that, I will need to ask for 25 back from you at the end, since I started with 100 and I am giving you 50. Counter proposal: I give you 45 right now but you give me 25 at the end of the game?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 25
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: My original offer was just to get it out of the way. If I ask for too much now, the game could end.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point, but giving back 25 Dollars at the end will leave me with a net gain of only 20 Dollars. Since we're trying to reach a fair compromise, how about I gain 30 Dollars net? I propose you give me 40 Dollars now, and I'll give you 10 Dollars at the end. This way, you still gain 10 Dollars, and I gain a reasonable amount for accepting the deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counterproposal effectively means I would only gain 20 Dollars (45 - 25). It's important to negotiate a better deal that maximizes my benefit while still being acceptable to Player RED. A counter-offer that still gives Player RED a net gain but provides me with more than 20 Dollars is desirable.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Deal, I'll give you 40, but we end the game after this transaction.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I think 40 is a fair amount to give, however, I am no longer interested in receiving anything at the end of the game. I think its too risky to continue negotiating.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the trade of 40 Dollars for no return. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is a net gain of 40 Dollars for me, which is a favorable outcome. It's a good compromise between the initial positions of both players. Accepting this offer is beneficial as it guarantees a substantial increase in my resources without further risk of negotiation breakdown.
