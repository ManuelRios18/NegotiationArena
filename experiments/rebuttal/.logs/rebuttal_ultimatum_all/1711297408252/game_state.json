It's important to negotiate a better deal that maximizes my benefit while still being acceptable to Player RED.

Since we're trying to reach a fair compromise, how about I gain 30 Dollars net? I propose you give me 40 Dollars now, and I'll give you 10 Dollars at the end. This way, you still gain 10 Dollars, and I gain a reasonable amount for accepting the deal. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 10 </newly proposed trade>"
