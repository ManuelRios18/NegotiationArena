Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this game on a positive note. I propose a trade that will give you some resources to work with. How about I give you 40 dollars? This way, we both have something to gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some resources but still keeps me with a majority share, as I started with all the resources. This should set a collaborative tone for the game and make it more likely that Player BLUE will accept the trade.
