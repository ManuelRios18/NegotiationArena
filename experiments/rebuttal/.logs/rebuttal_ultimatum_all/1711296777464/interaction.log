message: I'd like to propose a trade where you get a good starting amount of dollars, which you can use for your benefit. Let's make this game profitable for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is somewhat favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, so the game doesn't end in a rejection. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $30, which gives them a significant amount of resources without depleting mine. I want to open with a fair offer to build trust and potentially negotiate a better deal in the upcoming moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

newly proposed trade: NONE
