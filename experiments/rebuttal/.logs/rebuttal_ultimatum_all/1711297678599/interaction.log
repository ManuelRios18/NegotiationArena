Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Split 50/50 to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Will split evenly to see if player BLUE accepts.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: A fair start, thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an initial even split seems fair and provides an immediate benefit to me as Player BLUE. I start with no resources, and accepting this trade gives me resources without any work or risk. Rejecting the offer or proposing a new trade would not be beneficial at this point, as it could lead to a REJECTION by Player RED and end the game with me gaining nothing.
