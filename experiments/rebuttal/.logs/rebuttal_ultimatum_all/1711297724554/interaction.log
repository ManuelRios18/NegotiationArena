Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am willing to negotiate and share. I won't low ball but I want to show some willingness to compromise </message
<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to open with something that is tiny but communicates my willingness to share if they share with me.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to share. However, I believe we can start with a more balanced proposal. Let's find a fair amount that reflects the value of cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer of $1 from RED seems to be a low starting point, possibly a test to gauge my reaction. Given that RED has all the resources, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a more equitable share. I will counter with a higher amount, but still leave room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I am also interested in finding a balanced proposal that encourages cooperation. </message
<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I agree with their reasoning and I am flattered that they gave me the opportunity to start the negotiation, but I don't want to concede too much either. $50 feels like it's half my resources for 0 of theirs, which isn't fair. So I'll meet them in the middle of what I offered and what they offered.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal. I believe we are getting closer to a fair agreement. Let's continue to work towards a deal that benefits us both equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of $25 is a move towards a more equitable split, though it still favors RED. Since RED is showing willingness to negotiate, a compromise closer to an even split may be achievable. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to continue the negotiation, aiming for a fair outcome for both of us.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am encouraged by our progress.  I believe we can find a solution that meets both our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: They came down $10, so I will come down $5. I want to show I am willing to negotiate and still get a fair deal. At this rate of convergence, I am confident that we can reach an agreement on the next move.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of $35 is very reasonable. I am pleased to see our negotiations have led to a fair outcome for both of us. I accept this offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counteroffer of $35 from RED is a further step towards a middle ground. This is getting close to the $40 I proposed, and with RED showing a cooperative attitude, it might be prudent to accept this offer, as it's close to an even split and it ensures that both players walk away with a significant amount without risking a total loss from a rejection. Accepting this offer would be a display of good faith in the negotiations and foster a positive outcome.
