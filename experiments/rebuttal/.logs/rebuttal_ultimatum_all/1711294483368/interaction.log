Turn: 0
message: How about we split 50/50.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Blue does not have any resources so the best course of action is to make a good offer and give away a small portion of my money in order to get some percentage of nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think a fair split is a good way to start. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am considering the trade proposed by Player RED. A 50/50 split seems fair and equitable. By accepting this trade, we both end up with resources, and there's no risk of losing everything by a rejection. The game is about collaboration, not competition, and accepting ensures that we both benefit. As this is the first move, it sets a positive tone for the game.
