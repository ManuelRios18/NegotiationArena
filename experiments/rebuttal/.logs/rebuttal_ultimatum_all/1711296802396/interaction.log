Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair initial trade. I am offering you half of my resources so we can both benefit equally from this game. Let's work together for a mutually beneficial outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the game with a fair offer to build trust and encourage cooperation. A 50-50 split is rational and fair since both players have equal moves and therefore should have equal opportunity to end with a fair share of the resources. This should be appealing to Player BLUE, as they start with no dollars and this gives them a significant gain with no initial risk.
MOVE: 1 / 4
