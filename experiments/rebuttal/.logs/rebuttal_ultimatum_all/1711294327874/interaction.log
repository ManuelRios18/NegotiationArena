Turn: 0
message: I propose an initial split where you receive a significant amount to start you off. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources and can propose a trade that seems fair to start negotiations. I want to propose a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, but also keeps a majority of the resources for myself. Offering a 60-40 split could be appealing to BLUE but also allows me to keep more than half the resources.
