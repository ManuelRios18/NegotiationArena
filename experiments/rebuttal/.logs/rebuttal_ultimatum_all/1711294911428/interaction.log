message: Hey Player BLUE, let's split the resources equally. How about we both get 50 Dollars each?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to share the resources equally.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. Let's both walk away winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED to split the resources equally is fair and beneficial for both of us. I will gain 50 Dollars from nothing which is a good start. Accepting the proposal will ensure that I walk away with resources rather than risking a rejection and ending up with nothing.
