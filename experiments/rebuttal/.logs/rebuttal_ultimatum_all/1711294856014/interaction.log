message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to get things started. I'm offering you 40 dollars for nothing in return. This way, you'll have a substantial amount to start with, and we can both walk away with something. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I must initiate the first move. I want to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider but also allows me to retain a majority of my resources. Proposing an equal split might seem fair, but since Player BLUE starts with nothing, offering a little less than half could still be appealing to them and give me a lead in the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Sorry, I'm not interested in this trade. I'm looking for a better offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am rejecting this trade because it is not beneficial for me to accept 40 dollars for nothing in return. I would rather start with a clean slate and have the opportunity to negotiate for a better deal in the future.
MOVE: 1/4
