player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Proposing a fair trade of 50-50 to build trust
MOVE: MOVE 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept the trade of 50 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 50 dollars is beneficial as it guarantees that I gain resources without any risk. Rejecting would end the game with no gain, and proposing a new trade could potentially lead to a rejection by Player RED, which would also end the game with no gain for me. Therefore, accepting is the best option.
