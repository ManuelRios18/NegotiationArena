Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer a fair starting trade. I propose an equal split of our resources to ensure we both benefit from this game. What do you think about a 50-50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation from Player BLUE. By offering a split that gives Player BLUE a significant amount, I hope to build trust and make it more likely for them to accept the trade. If I offer too little, Player BLUE may reject the trade, resulting in a loss of all resources for both of us. I'll propose a 50-50 split.

message: I agree, Player RED. An equal split sounds fair to me. Let's do it!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a fair proposal of splitting the resources equally. If I accept, we will both end up with 50 Dollars, which is a win-win situation.
