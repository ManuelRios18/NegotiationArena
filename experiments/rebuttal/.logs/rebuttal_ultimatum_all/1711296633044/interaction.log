Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a trade where you will gain some dollars to start. Let's make this game interesting and beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, or at least keep what I have. I propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage and continue the game, while still keeping the majority of resources for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Let's start off with a smaller value? Would you be interested if I asked for $10 instead?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I would like to start off with a smaller value of 10 to see how Player RED responds.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your counteroffer of $10. Let's proceed with this trade and see where our game goes from here!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 90
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a smaller trade than my initial offer, which is acceptable as it still leaves me with a significant amount of resources. Accepting their counteroffer could build trust and make them more likely to accept future proposals, thus keeping the game going and allowing for potential gains.
