Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal. I'm willing to give you some of my dollars to get the ball rolling. How about I give you 20 dollars to start? This way, we can both end up with some resources instead of risking losing everything by rejecting proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I'm initiating the trade, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars, but not too much, as I want to maintain the upper hand. Starting with a smaller offer can also leave room for negotiation in further moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I hope we can build off this and continue making beneficial trades.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the 1st turn and there is no other information to go off of. I will ACCEPT the proposal of 20 dollars so that I have a basis to barter from.
MOVE: 1/4
