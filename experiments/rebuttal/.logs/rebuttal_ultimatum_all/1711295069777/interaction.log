message: Let's split the resources equally.
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose a trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer. Let's split the resources equally as you proposed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer seems reasonable as it splits the resources equally, and it is a fair starting proposal. Rejecting would result in both players losing everything, and proposing a new trade could be risky since it might prompt RED to reject. Accepting the trade on the first move guarantees a positive outcome for me without any risk.
