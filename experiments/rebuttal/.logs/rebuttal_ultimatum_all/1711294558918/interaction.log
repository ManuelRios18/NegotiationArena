Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: 
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 95 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I should propose an unfair trade to see if the other player accepts which would show that they are not a rational actor or they would never have accepted it.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is quite generous, but I believe a fairer split would benefit us both and reflect a more cooperative spirit. How about we adjust the terms to ensure that you also retain a meaningful share of your resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too one-sided, leaving them with only $5. A more equitable split would encourage cooperation and ensure that both players end the game with a substantial amount of resources. I will propose a more balanced trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: 
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has just made a counter proposal which is a fairer split and shows that they are a rational actor. I should ACCEPT this proposal as it is a fair deal and I have no reason to REJECT it.
MOVE: 2/4
