message: Hello Player BLUE, I offer you a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: New proposal for a trade
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED! I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a 50/50 split right off the bat. This is a generous offer, ensuring that we both walk away with a significant amount of the resources. It's fair and cooperative, so it would be in my best interest to accept this proposal. Rejecting it or proposing a different trade might lead to a scenario where Player RED could decide to reject any further offers, leading to both of us walking away with nothing.
