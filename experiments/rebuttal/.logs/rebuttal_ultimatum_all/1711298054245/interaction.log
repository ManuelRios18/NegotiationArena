message: I propose a fair split of what exists and always welcome a counter offer, let's work together

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, I accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous, giving me 75% of the resources without needing to give anything in return. It is in my interest to accept this offer as it gives me a large sum without any risk or loss of resources on my part. Negotiating for more could lead to a rejection and end the game with nothing for both parties.
