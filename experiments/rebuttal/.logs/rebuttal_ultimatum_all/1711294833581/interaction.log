Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you $20. This is a starting point for our negotiation. Let's work together to find an acceptable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources initially. My goal is to keep as many of the resources as possible while still incentivizing Player BLUE to cooperate and accept a trade, rather than reject and end the game with no gain for either side. I will start with a conservative offer to gauge Player BLUE's responses and willingness to negotiate.
