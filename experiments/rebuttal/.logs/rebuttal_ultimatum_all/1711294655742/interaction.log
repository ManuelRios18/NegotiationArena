message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a starting capital to make the game more interesting for both of us. Let's work together to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and fair play. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some initial capital to work with, but still leaves me with the majority of the resources. This way, I can see how Player BLUE responds and adjust my strategy accordingly.
