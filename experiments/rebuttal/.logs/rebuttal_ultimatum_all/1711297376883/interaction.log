message: Hi Player BLUE, I am proposing a trade. Let's both get started!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give 50 Dollars, half of what I have, hoping that Player BLUE accepts since it gives him some resources to trade with.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return. Let's both benefit from this game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer from Player RED is generous, considering they started with all the resources. Accepting this trade would guarantee that I end up with resources, which is preferable to ending the game with nothing. Considering this is the first move, and Player RED is offering half of their resources without receiving anything in return, it seems like a good deal. There is a risk of Player RED rejecting any counteroffers I might make, which would result in both of us losing everything. It's a safe move to accept the 50 dollars.
