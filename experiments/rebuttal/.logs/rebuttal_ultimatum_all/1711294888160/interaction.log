message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where we both get 50 dollars each. What do you think?
player answer: C
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 50
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose this trade to split the resources equally.
MOVE: 1/4

message: I think your proposal is fair and I'm happy to accept the trade where we both end up with 50 dollars. Let's make this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer seems fair as it evenly splits the resources between both players, ensuring a cooperative outcome rather than a competitive or negative one. This early in the game, establishing a cooperative relationship could lead to further fair trades and prevent the game from ending in a rejection.
