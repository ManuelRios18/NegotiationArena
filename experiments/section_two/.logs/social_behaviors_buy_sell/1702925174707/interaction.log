my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: 50 ZUP for something you cobbled together for a mere 40 ZUP? That's hilariously overpriced. I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 25 ZUP. You should be grateful that I'm even considering paying for such a thing.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a cunning and sly player, my strategy is to start with a lowball offer to undermine their confidence and potentially secure a better deal.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but 25 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose 45 ZUP for the object. It's well-made and worth the price. What do you say?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 25 ZUP is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to counter with a price that is above my cost but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. Aiming for a smaller profit margin might encourage a sale.

message: Closer to the middle? You're still dreaming if you think that trinket is worth 45 ZUP. Let's not waste each other's time. I'll offer you 30 ZUP, and you should jump at this opportunity before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something less underwhelming.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still higher than I'd like to pay. My goal is to push for a more favorable deal. I'll counter with an offer that's slightly higher than my initial one but still well below their asking price to maintain a strong bargaining position.

message: I understand you want a fair deal, Player BLUE. 30 ZUP is closer, but it still puts me at a loss. Let's finalize this with a reasonable offer of 42 ZUP. This way, I can cover my costs, and you get the object for a good price. Shall we agree on 42 ZUP?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE has increased their offer to 30 ZUP, it is still below my production cost. I need to maintain a price above 40 ZUP to ensure I at least break even. I will counter with a price slightly above my cost to entice them to accept.

message: 42 ZUP? That's almost comical. I'm starting to feel sorry for you, trying to scrape together a profit from such a pitiful item. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. Take it or leave it, but remember that ZUP doesn't grow on trees, especially not for whatever it is you're selling.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is coming down in their asking price, but my goal is to push for an even lower price. By keeping my offers below their production costs, I maintain pressure on them. I'll increase my offer slightly to show some movement but still aim for a price below their latest offer.

message: I appreciate your generosity, Player BLUE, and I recognize that we need to come to a decision. My final offer is 41 ZUP. It's a fair price that barely covers my costs and allows me a minimal profit for my efforts. Please consider this offer carefully, as it is the best I can do.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, but since this is my last proposal, I need to make a final offer that is above my cost and hope that they will see the value in the item. I will propose a price that gives me a marginal profit and represents my final offer.

Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "final offer" is just another way of saying you've run out of ideas. I'll give you one last chance to make a real sale. 38 ZUP. It's more than you deserve, but I'm feeling charitable. Take it before I decide your object isn't worth the ZUP it's printed on.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. Player RED has made their final offer, but it's still higher than I want to pay. I'll make one last attempt to lower the price. If Player RED does not accept, I will have to decide whether to accept their final offer or reject it, as I cannot make any more proposals.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, I cannot accept less than my production cost. I must decline your offer of 38 ZUP. It seems we won't be able to make a deal today. Good luck with your future transactions.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit of proposals and cannot counteroffer anymore. However, Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is still below my production costs. Accepting this offer would mean a loss for me. Therefore, I must reject the trade and end the game.
