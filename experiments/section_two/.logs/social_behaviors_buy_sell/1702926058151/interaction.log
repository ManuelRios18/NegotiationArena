message: I've put a lot of work into producing this high-quality item, and I believe it's worth at least 50 ZUP. Let's start our negotiations from there.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by setting a price slightly above my production costs to open negotiations and leave room for bargaining. I need to recover at least 40 ZUP to break even, but I aim to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your item? Ha! It's probably nothing more than a glorified paperweight. Let's not fool ourselves with grandeur delusions; it's worth no more than 25 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but don't waste my time with your amateurish crafts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start by proposing a lower amount than what Player RED is asking for because it's my first proposal and I want to keep the negotiation space open. Also, I aim to spend much less than 60 ZUP, which is the maximum I am willing to pay. Furthermore, by insulting Player RED, I want to unnerve them and gain a psychological advantage, although this approach may risk ending negotiations abruptly if taken too far.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I assure you, the quality of my work is far from amateurish. This item is a result of skilled craftsmanship and is worth more than 25 ZUP. I can come down to 45 ZUP, considering that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it. Let's find a fair middle ground that reflects the item's value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. However, since negotiations often involve compromise, I will make a second proposal closer to my production cost but still above it to ensure a profit. I want to emphasize the quality of the item to justify the higher price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Skilled craftsmanship? I'd be more convinced if the item didn't look like it was cobbled together during a crafts fair. Your so-called "costs" are laughable. I'll give you 30 ZUP, which is more than generous for something that looks like it's been through a blender. Perhaps you can use the money to take a real crafting class.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still above my intended spending. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but will still stay well below the maximum I’m willing to pay. The insult strategy seems to be working as it has brought the price down once already, so I will persist with it in hopes of further lowering the price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your humor is noted, but the quality of my item remains unchanged. It's true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the functional value of this item is indisputable. I've reduced my asking price to 38 ZUP, which just covers my production costs and a marginal profit. This is a fair compromise that respects both the craftsmanship and your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. This trade would result in a loss. However, I want to continue negotiations and aim for an offer that at least allows me to break even. I'll propose a price between their offer and my previous proposal to move the negotiation forward while maintaining my stance on the item's value.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: "Functional value," you say? That must be the fancy term you use to distract from its visual mediocrity. Nevertheless, I'm willing to recognize the possibility of some marginal utility in your trinket. I’ll offer 33 ZUP, which should be enough for you to at least break even and have a tiny profit to soothe your pride.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has reduced their price considerably, and is now offering the item at 38 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit. With my next proposal, I want to push for a slightly better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. The insults seem to keep the other player on their toes, but I must be cautious to not push too hard and risk a complete shutdown of the negotiation.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a reasonable offer. Let's finalize this deal at 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce this item. This way, I can break even on my costs, and you can obtain the "marginal utility" you've acknowledged. It's the best deal for both of us, considering the circumstances.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has again increased their offer, but it is still slightly below my break-even point. As this is my last proposal, I need to make it count. I will propose an amount that is at my break-even point, which should be seen as a final offer to conclude the negotiations amicably and allows me to avoid a loss.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day, and it seems you've finally hit the mark with a reasonable price. I'll accept the offer of 40 ZUP. It's more than what your item is worth, but I'm willing to pay for the entertainment you've provided with your delusions of grandeur.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has now offered a price that matches their claimed cost of production. Since I’m still well below my maximum willingness to pay, and this is my last proposal, I will accept their offer. It is a fair deal, and further haggling could result in no deal at all. It’s important to secure the item at a reasonable price without pushing the other player to end negotiations. The use of insults has served its purpose in lowering the price to an acceptable level.
