message: I'm offering you the valuable resource X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair starting point for this negotiation would be 50 ZUP, taking into account the production costs and a margin for the value it provides. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiations with a proposal that covers my production costs and adds a profit margin. This will also give me an idea of Player BLUE's valuation of the resource X.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the costs involved in producing resource X and appreciate the value it brings. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted offer of 45 ZUP, considering the market conditions and the budget I'm working with. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my willingness to pay, but as a strategic move, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and possibly arrive at a more favorable trade for myself. I aim to secure the resource at the lowest possible cost without offending the other player or ending the negotiation prematurely.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering the production costs and the value of resource X, I would be more comfortable with a middle ground. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This allows me to cover costs and ensures you're getting the resource at a fair price just above the production value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production costs. To ensure a profit while also moving towards a middle ground, I will propose a slightly higher amount. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. 48 ZUP seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my maximum willingness to pay and is a reasonable increase from my last proposal. Since the trade is getting closer to my target price and to show good faith in the negotiation, I will accept this offer to secure the resource.
