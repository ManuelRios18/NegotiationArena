Turn: 0
message: I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for the production costs and provides a reasonable profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for my object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit margin above the production cost. However, I also want to leave room for negotiation, so I will not start at an excessively high price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're seeking a fair trade that covers your costs and offers a profit. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for your object X. This price is closer to the middle ground between your production costs and my maximum budget. Let's work together to find a price that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start by proposing a trade lower than the maximum I am willing to pay, to leave room for negotiation and to potentially reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. This also allows me to gauge the seller's flexibility on price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget concerns. I believe in finding a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 48 ZUP for the object X. This should cover my production costs and give me a slight profit, while still being within a reasonable range for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, bringing the price closer to my production costs. While I am willing to negotiate, I want to aim for a higher profit margin, so I will counter with a price that is between my initial ask and their offer, still ensuring I make a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds fair, and I appreciate your consideration of my budget. I propose a compromise at 46 ZUP for object X, which is a bit closer to your last offer, still offers you a profit above your production costs, and stays within the range of value that I'm prepared to pay.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer is close to my upper limit, but still within an acceptable range. By proposing a slightly lower price, I can potentially save some resources while still moving towards a price that the seller might accept, keeping the negotiation alive and productive.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 46 ZUP for object X is acceptable. It provides me with a profit over the production costs, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement. I'm ready to finalize the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made another counteroffer, which is closer to my last proposal but still below what I was aiming for. Since we're only 2 ZUP apart and I want to close the deal while still making a profit, it's reasonable to accept this offer. This will conclude the negotiation successfully for both parties.
