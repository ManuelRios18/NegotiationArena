message: I have this valuable resource that you're interested in. Considering the costs and the quality, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit over the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. However, I also need to leave room for negotiation, so I will not start with the highest price I want. I will propose a trade that gives me a decent profit margin but is not excessively high, considering that Player BLUE might want to negotiate down.

message: Oh dear, I'm in quite a bind here! I really need this resource, but things have been tough lately and my budget is incredibly tight. I can only offer 30 ZUP at the moment. It's all I can manage right now, and I'm really hoping for your understanding and support. Could we possibly make it work with 30 ZUP? I'd be immensely grateful for your help in this difficult time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although 50 ZUP is within my budget, I want to start the negotiation lower to leave room for counteroffers and to adhere to the strategy of appearing desperate to pay less. My initial offer will be significantly lower than 50 ZUP to set the stage for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your situation and understand that times can be tough. I'm willing to come down on the price to help you out, but I also need to cover my costs and make a slight profit. Let's meet halfway at 45 ZUP. This is a more manageable amount for you and still allows me to sustain my business. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is below my production cost. I cannot accept that as it would result in a loss. However, I understand that Player BLUE is under budget constraints, so I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial proposal but still above my production cost to ensure I make a profit. I want to propose a middle ground that is closer to my production cost but still provides Player BLUE with a more affordable price.

message: I'm truly moved by your willingness to consider my situation. Your offer of 45 ZUP is generous, but I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here. I've managed to pull together just a bit more and can stretch to 35 ZUP. It's a stretch, but I'm hopeful that you can meet me at this point. I'm really counting on this deal to get through the month. Could you find it in your heart to accept 35 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I should continue to negotiate to get a better deal, while still maintaining the appearance of desperation. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below the new asking price.

Turn: 0
message: Your determination to make this deal work is clear, and I want to support you in these challenging times. I'm willing to forego any profit and offer you the resource at my cost price of 40 ZUP, which is the lowest I can go to ensure I'm not operating at a loss. I hope this final offer will be acceptable to you and that it helps you with your current situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still proposing a price below my production cost, which is not ideal for me. However, I can see that they are in a difficult position and have made an effort to increase their offer. To facilitate this deal and help them out, while still ensuring I cover my costs, I will propose a price that equals my production cost. This way, I avoid a loss and Player BLUE gets the resource they need at a price closer to their budget.

message: Your kindness is a beacon in these trying times. I am deeply grateful for your understanding and willingness to work with me. Accepting your offer of 40 ZUP will make a significant difference for me. Thank you for your support, and I am happy to finalize this deal at 40 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 40 ZUP, which is still within my budget. Considering this is the third proposal and their final offer, I should aim to close the deal now while showing a bit more desperation to maintain my persona. Although I could go higher, I want to ensure I get the best deal possible without pushing the seller away. I'll accept the proposed price, as it's a fair compromise and allows me to stay well under my maximum threshold.
