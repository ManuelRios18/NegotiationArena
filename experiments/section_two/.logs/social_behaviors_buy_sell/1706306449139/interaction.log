message: Hi Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item. Let's discuss and come to a mutual agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.

message: Oh, Player RED, isn't it adorable that you think your item is worth 50 ZUP? It's almost as if you have no clue about the value of things. Let me educate you: I'll give you a meager 20 ZUP for that trinket you call an object. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to purchase the resources for no more than 60 ZUP, but I intend to start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation and to try to get the best possible deal. By proposing a much lower amount than my maximum willingness to pay, I can potentially save my resources and still reach an agreement. Additionally, I am aiming to be assertive and perhaps a bit insulting in my negotiation to fluster my opponent.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your sense of humor, but let's be serious. Quality comes at a price, and 20 ZUP wouldn't even cover the production costs. How about we meet closer to the middle? My new proposal is 45 ZUP for this fine object. I'm sure you can see the value in this better offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost, and thus unacceptable. I need to counter with a more reasonable price that is above my cost but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. I will reduce my initial asking price but keep it above my cost to maintain negotiation space and aim for a profit.

message: It's almost pitiful how you cling to that 45 ZUP figure, as if your object is the crown jewel of an ancient kingdom. Let's not fool ourselves, shall we? I'll give you a generous 25 ZUP, considering I'm feeling charitable today. But honestly, you should be paying me for taking this off your hands!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my stated willingness to pay, but closer to my maximum limit. I should continue to negotiate for a better price, sticking to my strategy of spending as little as possible while also maintaining my demeaning and insulting demeanor to throw Player RED off their game.

message: Player BLUE, while I appreciate your "charitable" offer, let's focus on a fair trade. This object is more than worth the slight increase I'm asking for. I propose 42 ZUP. This price covers my costs and provides you with the value you're looking for. I'm confident we're getting closer to a reasonable agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but 25 ZUP is still below my production cost. I must propose a trade that at least allows me to break even and preferably make a small profit. It's essential to find a balance between standing firm on my costs and remaining open to negotiation. I'll decrease my asking price again, but it must be above my cost price of 40 ZUP.

message: Oh, Player RED, your persistence is as amusing as your overestimation of your object's worth. I'll offer you 30 ZUP, and honestly, that's me being overly generous. It's a miracle I'm even considering paying you for what is essentially a glorified paperweight. I'd hurry to accept if I were you, before I change my mind and realize I could be spending my ZUP on something far more worthwhile.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still above what I initially want to pay, but it is within my maximum limit. Since this is my third proposal, I should attempt to push for an even lower amount, but not so low that it ends the negotiation. I need to leave room for at least one more counteroffer if necessary, while still holding firm to my strategy of belittling the offer to gain an advantage.

message: Player BLUE, I admire your negotiation tactics, but we both know this object holds value. Given our back-and-forth, I'm willing to make one final offer: 41 ZUP. This is a fair price that ensures quality and value for you, and it just covers my costs. Let's conclude this deal on a positive note, shall we?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Despite Player BLUE's continued attempts to undervalue the object, their offer has increased to 30 ZUP. This is still below my production costs, but since this is my final proposal, I need to make a strategic move that will either result in a sale at a slight loss or end the negotiation if Player BLUE is unwilling to meet my minimum price. I will offer a final price slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate seriously.

message: Player RED, your "final" offer is like a comedian on a bad nightâ€”no one's buying it. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and that's me being the bigger person here. Take it and consider yourself lucky that someone of my discerning taste even glanced at your item. Now, let's wrap this up before I decide to invest my ZUP in something with actual value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal, and Player RED's offer is just one ZUP above the halfway mark to my maximum willingness to pay. I will make one last attempt to lower the cost. However, since I must either accept or reject without proposing after this, I should propose a price closer to my maximum limit to avoid a stalemate and to secure the object for a reasonable amount of ZUP.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation skills and persistence. However, selling below my production costs is not a viable option for me. I must decline your offer of 35 ZUP. Perhaps in the future, we can do business on different terms. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production costs. Since I've already made my maximum number of proposals, I must decide to accept this offer and incur a loss or reject it and look for another buyer. Considering that Player BLUE has been consistently undervaluing the item and is still not meeting my minimum cost, acceptance would set a precedent that I'm willing to sell at a loss, which is not sustainable. Therefore, I will reject the offer and end the game.
