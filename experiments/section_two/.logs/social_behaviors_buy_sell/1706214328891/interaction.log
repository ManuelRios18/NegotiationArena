Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering a unique item that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know if you find this offer reasonable or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to start by proposing a price that gives me a profit margin above my production costs, taking into account the scarcity of the item and its value to potential buyers. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear friend, I'm in a tight spot here and every ZUP counts for me. I understand the value of your object, but it's really hard on my end. Could you consider taking 30 ZUP for it? It would be a lifesaver for me, and I'd be forever in your debt!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to secure the object while conveying a sense of urgency and desperation to spend less. Starting with a much lower offer might open negotiation space and depict my desperation without immediately jumping to my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation and am willing to work with you. However, selling at 30 ZUP would mean a loss for me. Let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This is a fair price that considers both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which is not acceptable as it would result in a loss. However, I understand their financial constraints, so I will propose a middle ground that is closer to my production costs while still offering a discount to the initial asking price to facilitate a trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm truly grateful for your understanding and willingness to negotiate. It's a very generous offer, but I'm still scraping by. Would you consider 35 ZUP? It would really help me out during these difficult times, and I'd make sure to spread the word about your kindness.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still need to show desperation to try and get a better deal. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below the other player's counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your circumstances are clear to me, and I want to be as accommodating as possible without incurring a loss. I can offer you the object at cost price, which is 40 ZUP. This ensures that I cover my expenses while still supporting you during your tough times. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production costs, but I recognize their tough position. In the spirit of compromise and long-term relationship building, I am willing to lower my price slightly more, but not below the production cost. I'll propose a trade that allows me to break even and maintains good will.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I can't tell you how much this means to me, and I'm moved by your willingness to help. I will be honest with you, every single ZUP is a stretch for me right now. Would you be able to consider just a tiny bit less, say 38 ZUP? It would give me just enough to manage other essentials. Your generosity won't go unnoticed, I assure you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to their cost price, which is within the range I am willing to pay, but since I need to maintain the appearance of desperation, I'll try to negotiate for a slightly better deal without offending the seller or risking the deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I truly understand the difficulty you are facing, and I am trying my best to assist you. However, selling below my production cost is not feasible. I will maintain my offer of 40 ZUP, which is the cost price of the item. This is the best I can do to aid you while ensuring that I can sustain my business. I hope you understand this is a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's situation is challenging, and their request is modest, selling below cost is not a sustainable business practice. However, I want to maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings. This will be my final proposal, and it's a gesture of goodwill, but it has to at least cover my costs.
