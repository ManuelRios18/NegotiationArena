Turn: 0
message: I believe this is a fair starting offer considering the production costs and the quality of the resource. Let's negotiate a price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit on this sale. However, I don't want to start with an excessively high price that might scare off the buyer. I'll propose a price that gives me a decent profit margin while still being reasonable to start the negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer and understand the costs involved. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about a slightly lower price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a more favorable deal. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially save resources and still acquire the object. It's important to start the negotiation with some room for adjustments.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer. Let's meet a bit closer to my initial proposal. How about 48 ZUP for the resource? It's a fair compromise that still respects the production costs and offers you value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is still above my production cost, so there is a profit to be made. I might be able to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize profit while still keeping the deal appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my offer. I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I believe 46 ZUP is a fair counter to your proposal, offering good value to both of us while keeping in mind the costs. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous proposal but still below my maximum willingness to pay. It might be a good strategy to accept this offer to secure the resource without further back-and-forth, which could potentially lead to a higher asking price. However, I'll attempt one more negotiation step to see if I can obtain the resource for a more favorable amount, while also leaving room for a final agreement within my acceptable price range.

message: I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price. It's a deal that benefits us both. I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP, which is a 6 ZUP profit over my production cost. While this isn't as high as my previous proposal, it is still a profit, and continuing to negotiate may risk the sale. It may be wise to accept this offer to ensure a successful transaction.
