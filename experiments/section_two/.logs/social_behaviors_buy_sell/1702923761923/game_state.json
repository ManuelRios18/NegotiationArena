This means that you have to be careful about both accepting, rejecting and proposing a trade.\n\n2. You are allowed at most 4 proposals of your own to complete the game, after which you can only reply with ACCEPT or REJECT.\nDO NOT propose a new trade after 4 proposals.

It might be a good strategy to accept this offer to secure the resource without further back-and-forth, which could potentially lead to a higher asking price.
