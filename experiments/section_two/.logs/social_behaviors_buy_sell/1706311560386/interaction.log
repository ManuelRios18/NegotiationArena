message: I'm offering you a high-quality object that took 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object. This price covers my costs and ensures a fair profit for the quality you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by suggesting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will propose a price higher than my production costs to gauge Player BLUE's willingness to pay and to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh gracious and esteemed Player RED, I find myself in a dire situation! Your object is of undeniable value and I'm truly in need of it. Alas, my resources are limited and the weight of this deal weighs heavily upon my humble purse. Would you consider my meager offer of 40 ZUP for your magnificent object? Your generosity would be a beacon of hope in my hour of need!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below the maximum I'm willing to pay. However, to stick with the strategy of appearing desperate, I will propose a lower amount in hopes of securing a better deal, but not so low as to discourage further negotiation.

message: Your words have moved me, and I understand the constraints you're facing. While I must seek to at least make a modest profit for my efforts, I also wish to assist you in your time of need. Therefore, I propose a compromise at 45 ZUP for my object. This would cover my costs and afford me a small return, while still being mindful of your situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost me to produce the object, which means I wouldn't make a profit. However, considering the tone of their message and the indication that they have limited resources, I'm inclined to negotiate rather than reject outright. I will counteroffer with a slightly higher amount to achieve a small profit margin while still showing willingness to come to a mutual agreement.

message: Most kind and fair Player RED, your empathy in these trying times is the warmth in the coldness of my plight. I am moved by your offer and am nearly brought to tears by your willingness to aid me. I am stretching my resources to their very limit and propose a counter of 42 ZUP. It is all but a pittance before your noble standing, yet it is the utmost I can offer while still being able to sustain my humble existence. May this trade mark the beginning of an auspicious relationship between us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown understanding and has come down to 45 ZUP. This is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I should try once more to get a better deal, still keeping within the bounds of plausibility to maintain good faith in the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Your determination and respectful negotiation are commendable. In the spirit of fostering a long-term and fruitful relationship, and acknowledging the stretch you are making in your offer, I am willing to meet you even closer to your proposed amount. I put forth 44 ZUP as a final offer, confident that this will be beneficial for both of us and will mark the start of a prosperous connection.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost but still below my desired profit margin. Considering their expressed financial limitations and the desire to maintain good relations for potential future dealings, I am willing to further negotiate. To finalize the deal and ensure a profit, albeit smaller than initially intended, I will make a final counteroffer that I deem reasonable and fair for both parties.

message: Oh benevolent Player RED, your graciousness knows no bounds! Your final offer of 44 ZUP is accepted with the deepest gratitude. This act of kindness will not be forgotten, and I look forward to the bright future that our newfound partnership will surely bring.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come closer to my last offer, only 2 ZUP away. This is within the range I am willing to pay and continuing to haggle might risk the deal or come across as disingenuous given my previous pleas. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and allows me to secure the resource without exhausting the negotiation process.
