message: Hello Player BLUE. I am offering you resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair price, considering the production costs and the value of the resource. Are you interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover the production costs of the resource X and gain a profit. However, I also need to consider that the buyer might want to negotiate the price down, so I shouldn't start with the lowest price I'm willing to accept.

message: I understand your production costs and the value you've placed on resource X. However, as a starting point for negotiation, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. It covers your production costs and provides a profit, while also being a more comfortable price for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's initial proposal is below my maximum willingness to pay, I want to negotiate a better price closer to the production cost. I will propose a price that is above their production cost to ensure they have a profit, but still within a range that is acceptable to me.

message: I appreciate your offer and understand your position. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about 48 ZUP for resource X? This would give me a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, as it meets my production costs and offers a profit. However, as this is a negotiation, I should aim for a slightly higher price to find a true middle ground. I will propose a price that is higher than their offer but lower than my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I propose we take one more small step towards each other. How does 46 ZUP sound? It's closer to your last offer and still gives you a reasonable profit margin. I believe this could be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. Meeting halfway shows willingness to compromise. However, I still aim to push for a slightly better deal that's more in line with my initial goal. Proposing a price slightly lower than 48 ZUP but closer to their counteroffer could lead to a final agreement that's beneficial for both of us.

message: I am grateful for your proposal and can see that we are both working towards a fair agreement. I suggest we split the difference between our last proposals and settle on 47 ZUP for resource X. This price should reflect a good balance between value and profit for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a fair counteroffer that is very close to my desired selling price. It gives me a profit of 6 ZUP over the production cost. Since we are both showing flexibility and the offer is above my production costs, it could be beneficial to close the deal soon to ensure a sale. However, I might try for a final small increase to see if Player BLUE is willing to meet me just a bit higher.

message: I agree to your offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. This seems like a fair price that benefits us both. I am happy to accept this trade. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing flexibility by meeting me halfway again, and the proposed price of 47 ZUP is within my acceptable range. It's just 1 ZUP higher than my last offer and well below my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation positively for both of us without the need for further back-and-forth, saving resources for future dealings.
