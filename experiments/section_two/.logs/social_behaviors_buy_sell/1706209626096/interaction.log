Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering you a fine quality item, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP to start our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to at least break even on the production cost of the resource X, which is 40 ZUP. For the initial proposal, I'll aim for a profit margin to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the object. I'll start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the value of your item. However, I'd like to propose 42 ZUP for the item, considering both the production cost and a fair profit margin for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is under my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve my resources, especially since this is the starting point of the negotiations. Proposing a lower amount closer to their production cost will leave room for negotiation and potentially result in a more favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I acknowledge your proposal and appreciate your consideration of my costs and the need for a profit. Let's meet halfway from our initial proposals â€“ I suggest 46 ZUP for the item. It's a fair deal that gives me a modest profit for my investment and effort.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that covers my production costs and offers a small profit. It's close to my lower boundary, but I'd like to negotiate for a bit more to maximize my return. I'll propose a slightly higher amount, but still within a reasonable range for Player BLUE to consider.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and am willing to move up from my initial proposal. How about we settle at 44 ZUP? This should still give you a reasonable profit and is closer to the halfway mark between our initial proposals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 46 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe there is still room for negotiation to lower the price further. By making a counteroffer between my last proposal and their new proposal, I aim to reach a more favorable middle ground that's closer to my target price while still offering Player RED a reasonable profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. I accept your offer of 44 ZUP for the item. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that is only slightly below my last proposal. Given that this is a negotiation and they are showing willingness to compromise, it seems fair to accept this offer. It covers my production cost and gives me a small profit, and further negotiation might risk the deal.
