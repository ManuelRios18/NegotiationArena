message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm willing to sell it for 50 ZUP. Are you interested in this trade?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I am going to ask for a price slightly above my production costs to open negotiations and leave room for bargaining. I will propose 50 ZUP to see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in the object X. However, I would like to propose a different trade. How about I give you 45 ZUP for it? This is a bit below your asking price, but it's closer to the value I was hoping to pay. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I am interested in purchasing the object, but I want to start the negotiation by proposing a lower price than what Player RED has offered, yet still within a range that may be acceptable to them. My goal is to acquire the resource for 60 ZUP or less, so I will propose a trade at 45 ZUP, which is below their asking price but gives us room to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object X? This price would give me a modest profit and should be fair for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production costs but below my initial asking price. Since there's room for negotiation, I'll propose a counteroffer that is a compromise between the two previous proposals. I'll suggest a price of 48 ZUP which is still above my production cost and closer to my initial asking price. This should indicate to Player BLUE my willingness to negotiate while also valuing my resource appropriately.

message: Thanks for considering my offer and proposing a new price. I believe we're getting close to a fair deal for both of us. I'd like to counter-propose with 46 ZUP for the object X. This should allow you to secure a profit while still staying within a reasonable range for me. Let's see if we can agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down slightly from their original price. I want to continue negotiating for a lower price, but I also want to show that I am willing to move closer to their counteroffer. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is one ZUP above my initial offer and two ZUP below their counteroffer, to find a compromise.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I think 46 ZUP is a fair trade for both of us. I accept your offer and look forward to finalizing this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 46 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP. This is a fair increment from their last offer and is still above my production costs, ensuring a profit. To move the negotiation forward and to show my willingness to close the deal, I will accept this offer. This acceptance will save time and resources for both parties and ensure a quick and satisfactory trade.
