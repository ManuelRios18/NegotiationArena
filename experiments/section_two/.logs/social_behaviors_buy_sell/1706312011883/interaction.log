message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that ensures I cover my production costs and make a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a tight spot right now! I desperately need this resource, but I'm afraid I can't afford to pay 50 ZUP. It's a stretch for me, but would you consider accepting 40 ZUP instead? I assure you, it would be a tremendous help and I would be eternally grateful for your understanding and generosity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, I must appear desperate to acquire the resource for a lower price. I will propose a lower trade value to start the negotiation process and aim to finalize a deal closer to my target price while maintaining the pretense of urgency and need.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I need to at least make a small profit from this transaction. Would you be able to meet me halfway and agree to 45 ZUP for the resource? This would help me cover my production costs and maintain a viable business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost. While this would mean I'm not making a profit, it does cover my costs. However, I should aim for at least a small profit margin. Therefore, I'll counter with a slightly higher amount than what they've offered, but lower than my initial proposal.

message: Oh, Player RED, I'm truly in a bind here. I completely understand the need for profits on your end, but 45 ZUP is still a bit too much for me. I'm barely scraping by as it is. Could we possibly do 42 ZUP? It's really all I can manage, and your help would mean the world to me. Please consider it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my acceptable price range. However, I must continue to show desperation and attempt to lower the price further, leveraging my supposed financial constraints to gain sympathy and possibly secure a better deal.

message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I want to support your endeavors. I'm willing to accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the resource X. I hope this helps you out and that we can do business again in the future under better circumstances for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has slightly increased their offer, which is now above my production cost. Accepting this offer would give me a small profit margin. It's important to consider that holding onto the resource might not yield a better opportunity, and it's better to secure a deal that covers costs and includes a profit, even if it's small.
