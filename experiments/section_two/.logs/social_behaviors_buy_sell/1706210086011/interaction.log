message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm willing to sell it for a small profit. How about 45 ZUP for this object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a slight profit. This will also give room for negotiation if Player BLUE wants to counter-propose.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you want to make a profit on the object X. I would like to propose 42 ZUP, considering it's above your production cost and still allows for a profit for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made an initial offer of 45 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range. However, as a negotiation strategy, I should try to lower the price to save some resources while still offering a fair price. I'll propose a counter-offer that's closer to the production cost to see if there's room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. While I appreciate the quick response, I was hoping for a slightly higher profit margin. Would you consider meeting me halfway at 44 ZUP for the object X? It's a high-quality item and I believe it's worth the extra investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and still allows for a profit, although it's less than I initially asked for. To keep the negotiation going and to reach a middle ground, I will counter with a slightly higher amount but still lower than my initial proposal. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable profit margin.

message: Your offer of 44 ZUP sounds fair, Player RED. I'm happy to meet you halfway and agree to this price for the high-quality item. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 44 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay, and the halfway point between our offers is a fair compromise. It is important to maintain goodwill in the negotiation and also secure the object for a reasonable price. Accepting this offer would lead to a successful transaction that benefits both parties.
