message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a trade for 45 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell my resource which is X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will start by proposing a trade for a slightly higher amount to allow room for negotiation, but not too high as to seem unreasonable. This way, I can potentially make a profit and also give player BLUE room to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please, I'm in a really tough spot right now and I desperately need this resource, but 45 ZUP is just too much for me to afford at the moment. Could we possibly make a deal for 35 ZUP? That's really stretching my budget as it is, and it would be such a huge help to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to convey a sense of urgency and desperation in order to negotiate a lower price without making it obvious that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. By starting with a lower offer, I have room to negotiate upwards if necessary, while still aiming to stay as far below my maximum willingness to pay as possible.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, but selling at 35 ZUP would mean a loss for me since it cost 40 ZUP to produce. I want to help you out, so let's meet halfway. How about we settle on 42 ZUP? This covers my costs and gives you the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss. However, I want to maintain good relations and make a sale. I'll propose a middle ground that covers my costs and provides me with a small profit, which should be a fair deal for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand the need to cover your costs. Honestly, 42 ZUP is still a bit too much for me. I'm scraping together every ZUP I can, and it's been tough. Is there any chance we could do this for 38 ZUP? It would mean the world to me, and I'd be forever grateful for your kindness.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down in price, but it's still above what I would like to pay. My strategy includes showing desperation to get a better deal. Since I have room to negotiate and the current offer is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I will make a counteroffer that is a bit higher than my initial one but still aiming for a better price.

Turn: 0
message: I see you're really trying, and I want to support you. I can't go lower than 40 ZUP, which is my production cost. This way, I'm not making a profit, but I'm not losing either. I hope this works for you, as it's the best I can do.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my production cost, but it's still under the production cost. I want to close the deal while also not incurring a loss. To achieve this, I will make a final proposal that equals my production cost, ensuring I at least break even. This is my third proposal, and I need to be cautious not to exceed my four-proposal limit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding my situation and for being willing to work with me. I can see that you're being very fair by offering me the resource at your cost price. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. You've really helped me out, and I won't forget it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has reached their bottom line, which is at their production cost. Since this is still within my budget and I have only one proposal left after this, I should be careful not to push too hard and risk ending the negotiation without a deal. Accepting this offer would be a reasonable outcome, ensuring I get the resource I need without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.
