message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality item X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, providing a fair profit margin for a quality product. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least cover my costs, but I would also like to make a profit. I will start by proposing a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, how quaint that you think your item is worth that much! The mere fact that you're trying to offload it so desperately tells me it's probably not worth the ZUP it's printed on. But I'm feeling generous today. I'll give you 30 ZUP for your so-called "quality" item. Take it or leave it, RED.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm going to start by undercutting Player RED's asking price significantly to set the stage for a negotiation that favors me. Insulting Player RED might throw them off balance and give me a psychological edge.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but 30 ZUP is below my production costs. I understand we both want a fair deal, so how about 45 ZUP? It's a high-quality item, and I'm sure it will serve you well. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, so I cannot accept that. However, I understand the need for negotiation and am willing to come down from my initial price to find a middle ground. I will propose a price that covers my costs and provides a smaller profit, hoping it will be more appealing to Player BLUE.

message: 45 ZUP? You're delusional if you think I'd pay that close to your alleged cost. I have to wonder if it's truly high-quality or if you're just trying to swindle me. I'll do you a favor and offer 35 ZUP. That should cover your "costs" and save you the embarrassment of returning home with your tail between your legs and your precious item unsold.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a move to lower their price, which is expected. I'll continue to play hardball and push for an even lower price, utilizing insults to rattle them and potentially secure a better deal for myself.

message: Player BLUE, I assure you that the item's quality is as stated, and my intention is not to swindle but to conduct fair trade. I understand your concerns, so let's meet almost halfway. I propose 42 ZUP. This covers my production costs and gives you the item at a very reasonable price. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering a price that is below my production cost, but they have increased their offer which shows some willingness to negotiate. It's important to strike a balance between covering my costs and making the sale. I'll make a final compromise offer that is just above my production costs to try to close the deal.

message: Almost halfway? You must be jesting. It's as if you think your item is crafted by the divine. You'll need to do better than that to convince me. I'll offer you 38 ZUP, and that's me being more than fair. It's time you consider the reality of the situation and accept a deal that's more than generous on my part.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED has come down in price again, they are still above my initial strategy of paying no more than 60 ZUP. I will make one more proposal to get closer to my target price range, maintaining the aggressive stance to keep pressure on Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, I value our negotiation, and I recognize your position. To move forward, I propose 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. This ensures that you're getting the item for exactly what it cost me to produce. It's a fair and transparent deal, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to agree on this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer again, which indicates a continued interest in the item. However, their offer is still below my production costs. Since this is my final proposal, I need to be cautious and propose a trade that at least allows me to break even. I will reduce my expectations for profit and propose a price that covers my costs.

message: 40 ZUP, huh? It's amusing that you think this is a victory for you. I suppose I can part with such a trivial amount; not because it's worth it, but because I tire of this banter. Consider yourself lucky that I'm in a charitable mood, and let's conclude this tedious affair.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to the price point within my maximum willingness to pay, as stated in my goals. Since this is my last proposal, I will accept the deal, ensuring that I achieve my objective of acquiring the item for 60 ZUP or less, without showing any sign of satisfaction to maintain my sly and cunning persona.
