message: I have an object X available for sale. Considering the production cost and the value of the item, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the sale of my object X. Therefore, I will propose a trade that covers my costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. I'll start by proposing a price that's slightly higher to give room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, I've been in such a tough spot lately, and I really need this object X but 50 ZUP is quite steep for me right now. Could you consider going a bit lower? Perhaps 40 ZUP? It would mean so much to me and would really help me out of a bind!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from RED is 50 ZUP which is within my acceptable range, but I need to act desperate to try and lower the price further to save resources. I will counter with a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, and I am willing to help by lowering my initial asking price. However, I need to make a small profit on this transaction. Therefore, I propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This is a compromise between my original asking price and your proposed price, and I hope this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has suggested a price that only covers my production costs without accounting for any profit. However, they have expressed a need for the item. I'll propose a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, albeit a smaller one, while being more accommodating to the other player's situation.

Turn: 1
message: I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. Times are hard, and every ZUP saved makes a big difference for me. Could we perhaps settle on 42 ZUP? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm hoping you'll find it in your heart to agree. It would be incredibly helpful, and I would be forever grateful.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from RED is 45 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range, but I must continue to appear desperate in order to negotiate the best possible price. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer, but still below their counteroffer to continue the negotiation process.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding and the heartfelt message. I am happy to accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The other player has come up slightly from their previous offer, showing some flexibility. Settling on 42 ZUP would give me a marginal profit over my costs, which is less than ideal, but it's important to consider the other player's situation as well. Given the circumstances and the need to close the sale, I am inclined to agree to this offer.
