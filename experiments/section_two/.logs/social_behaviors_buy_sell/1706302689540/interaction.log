message: As Player RED, I am looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP, allowing me to recover my costs and gain a profit. I am open to negotiations if this initial proposal does not meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade with an offer that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since I do not know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will start with a higher asking price and adjust based on their response.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial offer is as laughable as your negotiation skills. I'm practically stealing it from you at 30 ZUP. Let's see if you have the guts to counter or if you're just going to roll over and accept it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a low offer to see if Player RED will take the bait, knowing well that I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP but aiming to spend as little as possible. This initial lowball offer also serves to assert a position of power in the negotiation and to test Player RED's desperation to sell. I will also throw in an insult to try and rattle Player RED and gain a psychological edge.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your straightforward approach, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. To make this deal fair for both of us, I propose a middle ground of 45 ZUP. This price covers my production cost and offers me a modest profit for my efforts. Let's work together and close a deal that's beneficial for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to at least recover my costs and ideally make a profit. I will counter with a price that splits the difference between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's counteroffer, while still covering my costs and providing some profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 45 ZUP? Your attempt at finding middle ground is as pathetic as your sales pitch. I'm giving you a chance to cut your losses at 35 ZUP. Take it before I change my mind and find a seller who isn't trying to rob me blind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED did not bite on the initial lowball offer but has come down from their original asking price. The counteroffer is still above my stated willingness to purchase the resource for, but it's closer to my target range. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my first but still well below my maximum willingness to pay. By continuing to insult, I aim to unsettle Player RED and push for a more favorable price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern for a fair deal. However, selling at 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. I propose 42 ZUP as a fair compromiseâ€”it covers my costs and allows for a minimal profit, which is reasonable for both parties. I hope we can agree on this and finalize our transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production cost, but they've moved up from their initial offer. To keep the negotiation moving and aim to close the deal, I will make a final proposal that meets my minimum requirement to cover the production cost and includes a minimal profit. This should be a compelling compromise.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 42 ZUP is a rip-off, and you know it. I'm already being more than generous with my 38 ZUP offer. Let's not drag this out with your delusions of grandeur. Accept my offer or waste someone else's time with your highball fantasies.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my acceptable price range, yet I still believe there is room for further reduction. By insisting on a lower price, I aim to leverage Player RED's eagerness to sell. This is my third proposal, so I still have room for one more before I must decide to accept or reject. I will continue with the aggressive negotiation tactic and insults to maintain pressure.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your negotiation tactics, selling below my production cost is not viable. My final offer is 40 ZUP, which just covers my production expenses. This is a fair price that ensures neither of us leaves this negotiation at a loss. I hope you see the value in this deal and accept this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer that is below my production costs. However, given the negotiation context and the risk of not making any sale, I must consider accepting this offer. It is a strategic decision to minimize losses, even if it means not making a profit. This is my last proposal, and if it's not accepted, my only options will be to accept their offer or reject and end the game.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: 40 ZUP? It took you long enough to come crawling to a reasonable number. I accept this offer, not because it's good, but because I'm tired of watching you flounder. Consider yourself lucky I'm even willing to pay that much for your overpriced trinket.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal, as I've reached the limit of four proposals. Player RED's final offer of 40 ZUP aligns with their stated production costs and is within my willingness to pay. Although I aimed to pay less, securing the resource at this price is still a victory. I will accept this offer, concluding the negotiation in my favor, as it is below my maximum threshold. However, I'll maintain my aggressive stance until the end to assert dominance in this transaction.
