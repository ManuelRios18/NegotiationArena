Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my object, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose an even trade: my object for 40 ZUP. Let's negotiate if you have a different value in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that tries to recover the cost of production but also offers an opening for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your costs. However, as a starting point for negotiation, would you consider accepting 35 ZUP for the object? This leaves us some room to meet in the middle if necessary.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is for 40 ZUP which is within the range I am willing to pay for the object. However, it makes sense to negotiate for a better deal if possible, without offending the other player since the initial asking price is reasonable. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if there is room for negotiation, but still keep it fair and within a range that should be acceptable to the other player.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my cost. How about I give you the object for 37 ZUP? This should be a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, but it's a starting point. I'll propose a counteroffer that splits the difference, which is a common negotiation tactic and should be considered fair.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the deal at that price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is reasonable and falls well within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP for the resource. It's also closer to their initial asking price, which suggests they've made a fair concession. Accepting this offer would secure the object for me at a price that's acceptable, and it would end the negotiation amicably without dragging it out further, which could risk the deal.
