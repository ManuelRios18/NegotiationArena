message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the quality and value of X. Let's work together to come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit margin. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to open the negotiation and see how Player BLUE values the object.

message: Surely you jest, RED. Your "high-quality" X would barely fetch 30 ZUP on a good day. But I'm feeling charitable today, so I'll offer you that much for your trinket. It's more of a favor, really. Let's not delude ourselves into thinking it's worth anything close to 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP for the resource and I want to humiliate my opponent while trying to spend as little as possible, I will make a low offer to start the negotiations. This will give me room to negotiate upward while still staying under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss for me. I've reduced my price to 45 ZUP, considering the production costs and the value X provides. I believe this is a more reasonable middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I must counter with a higher amount to try to reach a middle ground that is profitable for me. I will reduce my initial asking price but still keep it above my production costs to ensure I make a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You're quite the comedian, RED, thinking your product warrants such an exorbitant price. I'll do you a favor and up my offer to 35 ZUP, which is more than generous for what you're peddling. Let's stop playing these games; we both know your product isn't worth the 45 ZUP you're dreaming of.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my goal of spending less than 60 ZUP, but closer to my initial offer, which gives me leverage to keep negotiating downwards. I should counter with a slightly higher amount than my first offer but still well below the asking price to continue the negotiation process while maintaining my sly and insulting demeanor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your new offer is closer to a fair value, but it's important to me that we settle on a price that covers my production costs and allows for a modest profit. I propose 42 ZUP for the item. This is a fair compromise, and I think it respects the quality and cost of the product. Let's come to an agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but it is still below my production cost. I need to ensure that I do not incur a loss on this transaction. It's essential to suggest a price that's closer to my production cost, but still allows for a little room for negotiation. I will propose a price that gives me a minimal profit margin, which should be more attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is amusing, RED, but your grasp on reality seems to be slipping. I'll extend a lifeline and offer 38 ZUP before you completely drown in delusions of grandeur. It's high time you accept this more than fair price for the paltry item you're clutching onto. Shall we seal the deal, or do you need more time to indulge in your fantasies?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has made a concession, which is still above my initial offers but within the range I am willing to pay. However, I want to push for a better deal to stay true to my cunning nature and to not show too much willingness to increase my offer. By proposing a price slightly closer to RED's, I'm leading the negotiation towards my maximum willingness to pay without reaching it just yet.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is close, but I need to at least cover my production costs. I'm willing to sell X for exactly what it cost to produce: 40 ZUP. This is my final proposal, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Shall we conclude our business at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, it is only slightly so. At this stage, I have to consider that holding onto the product doesn't yield any profit, and the market for X may not support a higher price. This is my last proposal, and I want to close the deal without incurring a loss. I will propose a price that matches my production cost to break even and complete the transaction.

Turn: 1
message: Oh RED, your desperation is as transparent as glass. I'll indulge you one last time with an offer of 39 ZUP. It's a steal for you, really, considering the questionable nature of your product. Take it and let's conclude this charade, or walk away with your pride, if you have any left that is.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final proposal from RED is exactly within the range I am willing to pay for the resource. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I will make a final offer that is slightly under RED's asking price to maintain my sly character, but close enough to show I am willing to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 39 ZUP for the item. It's been a challenging negotiation, but I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is just 1 ZUP below my production cost. Even though it's a loss, it's minimal, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or no deal at all, which would be even less advantageous. Accepting the offer allows me to recoup most of my costs and potentially establish a relationship for future dealings where I can negotiate better terms.
