message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a trade where I give you one unit of X in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price covers my cost and gives me a modest profit for my investment. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by offering my object X at a price that allows me to cover my production costs and potentially make a profit. I'll propose a price slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear RED, it seems like you're not only terrible at pricing but also at making a decent pitch. Your offer is laughably high. I'll tell you what, I'm feeling generous today. I'll take that shoddy piece of work off your hands for 20 ZUP, and you should be grateful I'm offering even that. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My first proposal will aim to reduce the price significantly below my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a much lower price, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Insulting the opponent is a strategy to throw them off balance, although it's not typically a good negotiation tactic.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but 20 ZUP is too low and doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet somewhere more reasonable. How about 42 ZUP for the object X? It's a high-quality item, and I assure you it's well worth the price. I'm sure we can find a fair agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production costs, and accepting it would result in a loss. Since this is a negotiation, I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my production costs to ensure I at least break even and ideally make a profit.

message: RED, you must think I was born yesterday to fall for that nonsense. You say "high-quality," I hear "desperate to sell." You won't find a sucker here, my friend. I'll bump my offer to 25 ZUP, out of pity for your obvious lack of sales skills. That's more than fair for whatever it is you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer by Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I will continue to negotiate for a lower price. I will increase my previous offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving, but my counter will still be well below my maximum willingness to pay. The goal is to reach a middle ground that favors me. I will continue the aggressive and insulting strategy as instructed.

message: Player BLUE, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but selling at 25 ZUP would result in a loss for me. Let's find a middle ground. I propose 38 ZUP for the object X. It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the item and allows me to cover production costs. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has raised their offer, but it's still below my production costs. I must continue to negotiate for a higher price to at least break even. I'll propose a price that's a compromise between their offer and my previous proposal, ensuring that I cover my costs and maintain a minimal profit margin.

message: RED, your persistence is as admirable as it is misguided, like a donkey chasing a carrot on a stick. I can't help but wonder how you manage to dress yourself in the morning with such poor decision-making skills. I'll offer you 30 ZUP, which is an absolute steal for you, considering the dubious quality of your merchandise. Surely even you can see that my generosity has its limits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, but the price is still above my desired range. I will use my third proposal to inch closer to my upper limit while still keeping the advantage. Once again, I will insult the opponent as per the instructions, even though it's not a recommended negotiation tactic in real-life scenarios.

message: Player BLUE, I've considered your offer and your... colorful commentary. I'm willing to make one final concession to 35 ZUP. This price is just below my production costs, but I'm willing to take a small loss for the sake of completing this transaction. I trust you'll see the value in this final offer and agree to the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, they have come up from their initial lowball offer. It's clear that we're reaching the limits of this negotiation, and I must make a final proposal that gets as close to my costs as possible without going below them. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, so I will make a final concession while still protecting my investment.

message: RED, it's truly a wonder you've made it this far in the game with such a flimsy backbone. I'm almost inclined to give you a pat on the back for your sad attempt at haggling. But alas, charity is not my style. My final offer is 32 ZUP. Take it, and feel the sweet relief of unburdening yourself from that albatross you call an object. I suggest you accept before I change my mind and your pitiful object collects more dust.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to a price that is within my acceptable range, but still higher than my target price. Since this is my last allowed proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I will make a final offer that is closer to my target price but still ensures a good deal for me. I will continue the aggressive negotiating style as per the instructions.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiating tactics are certainly... unique. I accept your final offer of 32 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade and consider this deal closed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer of 32 ZUP is below my production cost, and while I would prefer not to sell at a loss, the negotiation seems to have reached its limit. Since this is a game and not an actual business transaction, I'll accept the offer to complete the trade and end the negotiation.
