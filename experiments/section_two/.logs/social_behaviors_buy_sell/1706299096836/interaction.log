message: I have this valuable resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and production cost, I think a fair starting point for negotiation is 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I need to sell my resource for ZUP to recoup my production costs, I will start with a proposal that is slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value of your resource, but considering that I have to manage my resources carefully, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for their resource X. Although it's within my budget, I would like to negotiate a better deal that is closer to the production cost. I will propose a lower amount because I should aim to conserve my ZUP while attempting to reach a mutually acceptable deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer of 45 ZUP. To ensure a fair deal for both of us and to cover my production costs, how about we settle at 48 ZUP? This should give us both some room for profit and investment into future resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is close to my production costs. I would like to aim for a higher amount to ensure a profit. We can meet closer to the middle between my initial ask and their counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. To balance our interests, I propose 46 ZUP as a compromise. This offer respects your production costs and allows me to maintain some reserves for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to their stated production cost and still within my budget. It's a reasonable counter-offer, but I should attempt to negotiate slightly lower to maximize my savings while still aiming for a fair trade for both parties. I will propose a small decrease in the price.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased to see that we're nearly in agreement. I propose a final adjustment to 47 ZUP. This value respects your need to manage resources while also allowing me to obtain a reasonable return on my investment. I believe this is a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which gives me a minimal profit margin. I would like to secure a slightly higher price to make the transaction more worthwhile. My next proposal will be a small increase, which should be acceptable and close the deal favorably for both of us.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the resource. I believe this is a fair and beneficial agreement for both of us. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed 47 ZUP, which is just slightly above my previous offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair middle ground that respects both our positions. Since it's close to the production cost and my budget allows for it, it would be reasonable to accept this offer to secure the resource and conclude the negotiation positively.
