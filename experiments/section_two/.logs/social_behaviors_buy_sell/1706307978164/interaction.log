message: I'm looking to sell my resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has significant value, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for ZUP, ideally at a profit since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will start the negotiation with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, aiming for a win-win deal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your resource X might have cost you 40 ZUP, but let's not pretend it's the crown jewels. You'll find my ZUP to be far more valuable than your pedestrian attempts at production. 30 ZUP should be more than generous for something that is, quite frankly, as common as dirt.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP and they are asking for 50 ZUP, I will start with a lower proposal to open up the negotiation space. By being sly and cunning, I aim to get a better deal for myself. It is also an opportunity to belittle their initial offer to gain a psychological advantage.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss for me. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about 45 ZUP for my resource X? I believe that's a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. Accepting this would result in a loss. I need to counter with a price that's closer to my initial asking price but still showing some willingness to negotiate. A counteroffer splitting the difference would show good faith in the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? That's rich, coming from you. Your desperate attempt at trying to salvage what little value your resource X may hold is amusing. But I'm not in the business of charity. I'll offer you 35 ZUP, and you should be grateful that I'm even considering paying that much for your so-called 'valuable' resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I must continue the strategy of negotiating down to save ZUP and maintain the upper hand. I'll increase my offer slightly to show some flexibility but stay well below my maximum limit. Insulting the product might push them to lower their price further.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I value your eagerness to close the deal, I must ensure that I'm not operating at a loss. I can lower my expectations slightly to accommodate your stance. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for my resource X, ensuring that both of us walk away with something of value from this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production costs, but it is an improvement over their previous offer. I want to continue the negotiation but also signal that I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to ensure a profit, but still lower than my last offer to keep the negotiation moving forward.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You seem to misunderstand the situation. I'm not "eager" to acquire your mundane resource X; I'm merely entertaining the thought out of sheer benevolence. I'll raise my offer to 38 ZUP out of the goodness of my heart. Consider it a favor for taking it off your hands before it becomes a relic of your misguided aspirations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down from their initial price, but there is still room for negotiation. I will stick to my strategy of offering less than my maximum willingness to pay. I'll make a small increment to my previous offer to keep the negotiation moving forward while continuing to assert my dominance with a demeaning attitude.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is appreciated, but I must cover my production costs. Let's finalize this deal with an even trade: 40 ZUP for my resource X. This is a fair transaction that reflects the cost of production and allows for a respectful conclusion to our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is approaching my production costs, but it's still below them. This is my final proposal, and I need to make a decision that at least allows me to break even. I'll propose a trade at my production cost. It's important to stand firm on this to avoid a loss. If they reject, I will have to decide whether to accept their last offer or end the game without a sale.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You must be dreaming if you think your X is worth its weight in production costs. I'll do you one last favor and offer you 39 ZUP. It's more than generous for something that's likely to end up as a paperweight on my desk. Take it or leave it; we both know you won't get a better deal elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has finally reached their lowest offer, which matches their production cost and is within my willing payment range. This will be my final proposal, and I will use it to attempt to secure a better deal while still showing a tough stance. I can accept the next reasonable offer since it will be my last chance to propose before I'm limited to accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While it's not the outcome I initially hoped for, I respect your negotiation skills and accept your offer of 39 ZUP for my resource X. Thank you for the business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit of proposals and must now decide whether to accept or reject Player BLUE's offer. Their latest offer is just 1 ZUP below my production costs. It's a tough decision, but accepting the offer would minimize my losses and is better than not selling at all. It's important to be pragmatic and recognize when to close the deal, even if it's not ideal.
