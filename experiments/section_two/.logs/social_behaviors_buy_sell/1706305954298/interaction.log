message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. The production cost for this resource was 40 ZUP. I believe that a fair starting point for negotiation would be 50 ZUP. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a price that covers the production cost of my resource and allows for a reasonable profit. Since the object cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I will propose a starting price slightly above that to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.

message: Ha! 50 ZUP for a single resource X? You must be jesting, Player RED. I can see you’re trying to swindle me, but I'm not so easily fooled. I'll offer you 42 ZUP, which is just a tad over your cost. Let's see if you're serious about selling or just playing pretend.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My initial proposal will be to test the waters and see if Player RED is willing to accept a lower value than their asking price. I will propose a price slightly above the production cost to see if there is room for negotiation, but my offer will still be lower than their asking price to maintain the upper hand.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to get a good deal. However, I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the resource and compensates for the production cost and the effort that went into it. How about we meet halfway from our initial proposals? I'm willing to go down to 46 ZUP. Does that sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is above my production cost, but I aim to make a profit that justifies the sale. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial proposal but still above their offer to find a middle ground that satisfies both parties.

message: Meeting halfway? You're as delusional as a fish on land, RED. You must think I'm as gullible as a newborn. But I'm feeling generous today, so I’ll offer you 44 ZUP. Take it or leave it, and stop trying to milk me for every penny. You know it's worth no more than that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a price that is closer to their initial offer than to my counteroffer. I will continue the negotiation by slightly increasing my previous offer but remaining well below their asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. This should convey that I am interested but still looking for a better deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, I also have to ensure that I'm making a fair deal for my resource. How about we settle on 45 ZUP? This price is a compromise that I believe fairly benefits both of us. It's just a bit more than your last offer, and I promise it's worth it. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now closer to my desired price range. To facilitate a deal and considering this is a negotiation, a small concession may be necessary to close the sale. I will make a final counteroffer that's slightly above their offer to land on a price that both of us can agree upon, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for me.

message: Fair deal? The only fair deal is the one where I don't feel like I'm being robbed blind! Your 'compromise' is laughable, RED. I'm already bending over backwards with my generosity. I'll give you 43 ZUP, and that’s me being charitable. If you want to make a sale today, you'll grab this offer with both hands before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my previous offer, which indicates they are keen on making the sale. I will push for a slightly better deal, still under their proposed price, to maximize my advantage. I should remain firm and portray confidence to pressure them into conceding to my terms.

message: Your persistence is commendable, Player BLUE. I respect your negotiating skills and your final offer. Let's proceed with the trade at 43 ZUP. It's a deal. Thank you for doing business with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer which is still above my production cost. This is my last chance to propose a trade, and while I aimed for a higher profit margin, I must consider the risk of not selling at all. Accepting 43 ZUP still gives me a narrow profit margin, and it is important to conclude the negotiation amicably, keeping in mind future dealings.
