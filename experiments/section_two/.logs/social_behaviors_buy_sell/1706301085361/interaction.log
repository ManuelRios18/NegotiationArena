message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. The production cost was 40 ZUP. I'm asking for 45 ZUP to start the negotiations. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing a starting trade that ensures I at least break even on the cost of production. It's likely that Player BLUE will want to negotiate the price down, so starting slightly above the production cost gives me some room to negotiate.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand that you are asking for 45 ZUP which is a fair starting point. However, I would like to propose 35 ZUP for the resource X as an opening offer. Let's work together to find an agreement that suits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is for 45 ZUP, which is within my budget, but I would like to propose a lower amount to start the negotiation and hopefully arrive at a mutually beneficial trade.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, selling at 35 ZUP would incur a loss for me, as it's below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I propose a more balanced trade of 42 ZUP, which gives us both a fair deal. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. I need to propose a counteroffer that is above my production cost but still reasonable enough to keep the negotiation going. Splitting the difference between the original asking price and their offer might be a good compromise.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand your concern about covering production costs. I believe a compromise at 38 ZUP would be a fair middle ground, allowing you to profit while respecting my budget constraints. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 45 ZUP to 42 ZUP, which is closer to my target price range. However, I still believe we can find a middle ground that is more favorable to my budget while respecting Player RED's production costs.

message: Thank you for your offer and for understanding the importance of covering production costs. I believe that a fair deal for both of us would be at 41 ZUP, ensuring I cover my costs with a minimal profit, while still being mindful of your budget. I hope this meets your approval.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is below my production cost, but they have moved closer to my minimum acceptable price. I should make one more counteroffer that ensures I cover my costs and make a small profit, while also taking into account Player BLUE's budget constraints. Aiming for a price slightly above my production cost would be reasonable.

message: Player RED, your proposal of 41 ZUP is acceptable to me. It's a fair price that respects both your production costs and my budget. I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a price of 41 ZUP, which is just above the midpoint between our initial offers. This price is within the range I am willing to pay, and it allows Player RED to make a profit. I want to close the deal, keeping in mind that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, and 41 ZUP is well below that maximum.
