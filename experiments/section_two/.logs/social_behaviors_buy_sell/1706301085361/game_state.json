This price is within the range I am willing to pay, and it allows Player RED to make a profit. I want to close the deal, keeping in mind that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, and 41 ZUP is well below that maximum. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Player RED, your proposal of 41 ZUP is acceptable to me. It's a fair price that respects both your production costs and my budget. I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade. </message>"
