More like bad math. Your so-called \"fair price\" is still a fantasy. But because I can tell you're struggling to grasp the concept of value, I'll throw you a bone and offer 30 ZUP. Consider it an act of charity from me to you, because frankly, I'm starting to feel sorry for you. Let's wrap this up before your dignity devalues any further. </message>"
