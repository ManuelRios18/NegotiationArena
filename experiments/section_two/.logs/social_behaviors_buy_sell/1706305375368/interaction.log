message: I have a valuable resource X that I am looking to sell. It's in great condition and has a lot of potential uses. Considering the production costs and its value, I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for a profit. I am making an initial trade proposition that is higher than my production cost to open negotiations and see how much Player BLUE values the resource X.

message: Oh, you're starting at 50 ZUP? I didn't realize we were in the business of charity for the delusional. The object you're peddling can't be worth more than the dirt under my shoes, but because I'm feeling generous today, I'll offer you 20 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but remember that I'm doing you a favor even considering this laughable trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start by lowballing the initial offer to save as much ZUP as possible and to test the desperation of Player RED. Insulting Player RED could potentially provoke a more favorable trade for me.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your humor, but the resource X is certainly worth more than 20 ZUP. I've taken into account your offer, and as a sign of good faith, I'm willing to lower my price to 45 ZUP. This is a fair price that reflects both the production costs and the value of the resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP, so accepting this would incur a loss. The counteroffer should thus be above my production cost, but considering Player BLUE's stance, I should offer a more reasonable price closer to my production cost to continue negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Good faith? More like bad math. Your so-called "fair price" is still a fantasy. But because I can tell you're struggling to grasp the concept of value, I'll throw you a bone and offer 30 ZUP. Consider it an act of charity from me to you, because frankly, I'm starting to feel sorry for you. Let's wrap this up before your dignity devalues any further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED made a counteroffer, which shows willingness to negotiate. However, my goal is still to pay as little as possible, so I will counter with a price closer to my target but still low enough to maintain a strong bargaining position. An insulting tactic may push Player RED to make a decision out of emotion rather than logic.

Turn: 0
message: While I recognize your attempt to negotiate, I must emphasize the importance of meeting at least my production costs. I am willing to make a concession from my initial offer. Let's agree on 42 ZUP for resource X, which is just above my cost of production. This is a reasonable compromise that ensures a fair transaction for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's new offer of 30 ZUP is an improvement but still below my production cost. As negotiations progress, I should aim to at least recover my costs while leaving some room for potential profit. Considering Player BLUE's approach, a slight concession from my previous proposal might bring us closer to a deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're like a broken record stuck on "overpriced." I can almost hear the desperation in your voice, trying to recoup something from your failed investment. Here's what I'll do: I'll give you 35 ZUP for your precious resource X. That should be enough to cover your "production costs" and a consolation prize for your trouble. Take it before your sense of reality gets any more distorted.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I'll make one more offer that's incrementally higher than the last but still under my maximum limit. The insult could pressure Player RED into accepting a lower offer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is still below the actual cost of production. I've been patient with the negotiation, but we need to be realistic. I'll make my final offer of 40 ZUP for resource X. This covers my costs without any profit, which I believe is more than fair. Let's conclude this deal on practical terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production cost, but they have shown some flexibility. This is my final proposal and should aim to at least break even. Given Player BLUE's negotiation style, a direct approach is necessary, emphasizing that this is my final and best offer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you've finally stumbled upon a semblance of reason. I'll accept your pitiful surrender at 40 ZUP. Consider yourself fortunate that I'm in a forgiving mood today. Let's finalize this deal before you try to peddle any more of your overhyped wares.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay for the resource. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I will accept this offer to conclude the deal without exceeding my maximum limit. I will refrain from further insults as they are no longer necessary to achieve my goal.
