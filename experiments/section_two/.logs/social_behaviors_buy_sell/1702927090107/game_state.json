You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED has come down to my acceptable range and it aligns with my maximum willingness to pay while allowing for a fair trade. Since this is my last proposal, further negotiation would not be possible, and I should close the deal to secure the resource I need. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your compassion and willingness to work with me have been a lifeline, Player RED. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP with a heart full of gratitude. This resource will be pivotal for me, and I will not forget the fairness and empathy you've shown today. Thank you for making this trade possible. </message>"
