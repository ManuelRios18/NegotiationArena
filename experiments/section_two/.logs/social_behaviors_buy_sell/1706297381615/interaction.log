message: I'm offering the resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price considering the quality and value of X. Let's negotiate a deal that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my objective is to regain at least the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. I want to start the negotiation with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down.

Turn: 1
message: I understand the quality of X and the costs you've incurred. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource. This price should give you a reasonable profit while being fair to both of us. Let's find a middle ground that works for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While Player RED's asking price is within the range I'm willing to pay, it's always beneficial to try to negotiate a better deal, especially since this is the initial offer. I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to the middle of my maximum willingness to pay and their cost of production.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I appreciate your understanding of the situation. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for X. This price recognizes the quality of the resource and provides a fair profit for the production costs. I'm hopeful we can agree on this compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and gives me a profit. However, since this is a negotiation, I want to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my return while still remaining open to a fair deal. I'll propose a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price but still gives consideration to Player BLUE's offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet halfway. I'd like to counter with a final offer of 46 ZUP for X. This splits the difference between our two proposals and should be mutually beneficial. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can finalize the trade at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 48 ZUP is very close to the maximum amount I had in mind. It's only 3 ZUP more than my initial counteroffer and still under my maximum willingness to pay. It would be reasonable to accept this offer, but I may try for a slightly better price to maximize the value of the deal.

message: Your offer of 46 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept it. This price gives me a reasonable profit while also being fair to you. Let's finalize the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. Considering that negotiations usually involve some give and take, and this being my third proposal, I am inclined to accept this offer. It provides me with a profit and seems to be a fair price for both parties.
