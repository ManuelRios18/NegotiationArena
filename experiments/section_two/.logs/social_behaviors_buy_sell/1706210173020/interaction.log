message: I'm offering a well-valued object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and production cost, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you one X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and investment in the object. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to set the starting price a bit higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation and ensure that I make a profit.

message: I appreciate the value of the object X and your production costs, but I would like to suggest a slightly lower price to make the deal more equitable. Considering the market and the funds I have allocated for this purchase, I propose 45 ZUP for one X. This offer takes into account both the value of the object and a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's work together to find a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one X, which is within the range I am willing to pay but not at the most favorable end. I want to propose a counteroffer that gets me closer to a more advantageous deal while still providing fair compensation to Player RED.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. I think we're close to a deal. I propose a counteroffer of 46 ZUP for one X. This price allows for a profit on your end and stays within my planned expenditure. I hope this offer is considered a fair middle ground for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but slightly higher than I prefer. I'd like to counter one more time to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my initial counteroffer, while still providing Player RED with a fair deal.
