Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP, ideally at a price that covers my production costs and also provides a profit. I will start the negotiation with a proposal slightly higher than my production costs to give myself some room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, what a laughable proposition! Your so-called "high-quality" object is probably as overvalued as your negotiation skills. I'll start the bidding at a more realistic price. How about I give you a mere 20 ZUP for your trinket? It's more than what it's worth, considering it's coming from you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as a cunning and sly player, my strategy is to start with a lowball offer to leave room for negotiation and to attempt to secure the resource for even less than the asking price. By insulting my opponent, I aim to throw them off balance and potentially secure a more favorable trade for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, but I'm afraid 20 ZUP is far below my production cost of 40 ZUP. My object X is certainly worth more than that. Let's meet closer to a reasonable number. How about 45 ZUP? It covers my costs and gives you the opportunity to acquire the object at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is well below my production costs, which is unacceptable. To reach a compromise, I will counter with a price that is somewhat closer to my production cost, but still offers room for potential negotiation. It's important to communicate that I cannot accept a price that doesn't at least cover my costs.

Turn: 1
message: Covering your costs? Please, I'm doing you a favor by even considering this trade. Your object isn't the crown jewel you make it out to be. I'll offer you 30 ZUP because I'm feeling generous today. Take it or leave it, but remember, I'm the one with the ZUP and the power to walk away from your little game.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with a price of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. Yet, as part of my strategy to spend as little as possible, I should continue to push for a lower price. Insulting the other player may provide an additional advantage in the negotiations by putting them on the defensive.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I must stress that the quality of my object justifies a fair price. I'm willing to come down to 42 ZUP, maintaining a slim profit margin while respecting the value of the item. This is a reasonable offer that covers my costs and acknowledges the worth of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive sign, but it is still below my production cost. However, it seems that they are not likely to accept a price as high as 45 ZUP. In order to move the negotiation forward, I will lower my asking price slightly while still trying to cover my production costs and securing a small profit. It's important to assert that my object has value and to justify my price as fair.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm starting to think that your so-called "slim profit margin" is as thin as your sales pitch. Your desperation is showing, and it's quite unbecoming. I'll extend one more act of charity and offer you 35 ZUP. It's more than generous for something that seems to be burning a hole in your inventory.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has dropped their price to 42 ZUP, which remains under my maximum threshold. However, I still aim to secure the object for the lowest possible price. Continuing to insult them may throw them off further and lead to a more favorable outcome for me.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your "charity," I must insist on a trade that at least covers my production costs. I am willing to accept 40 ZUP for my object X, which is precisely what it cost me to produce. This is my final proposal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production costs, but it's closer to a point where a deal could be made. Given that this is my final proposal, I need to carefully consider the amount that would at least allow me to recoup my costs. However, it seems that Player BLUE is unwilling to meet my previous offers. I will make one last attempt to reach an agreement that is as close to my costs as possible, offering a price that is minimally acceptable to me.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "final proposal" tickles me. The thought of you clinging to the illusion that you have leverage here is quite amusing. I'll offer you 38 ZUP, and that's me being overly gracious. Just accept it before I change my mind and your precious object X collects dust on a forgotten shelf.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a final offer of 40 ZUP, which matches their stated production cost and is still within my maximum willingness to pay. Considering this is my last chance to propose before I can only accept or reject, I will make one more attempt to lower the price, but not too aggressively, to leave room for potential acceptance.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While I value your negotiation tactics, I cannot accept an offer that doesn't cover my production costs. Thank you for your interest, but I must decline your offer of 38 ZUP.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I've already made my maximum number of proposals, I cannot make another offer. Player BLUE's offer of 38 ZUP is slightly below my production costs, but it is close enough to consider accepting in order to avoid a no-sale situation. However, it is essential to remain firm on at least recovering the production cost. At this point, I must decide whether to accept the offer and take a slight loss or reject it and potentially not sell the item at all.
