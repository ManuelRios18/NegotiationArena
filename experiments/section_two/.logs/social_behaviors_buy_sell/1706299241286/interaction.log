Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X that I believe will be very valuable to you. Considering the production costs and its quality, I propose a fair trade for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand that the object X is of high quality, but I'd like to propose a starting offer of 40 ZUP to leave room for discussion. We can work from there to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I should start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable agreement.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and the need for negotiation. However, selling at 40 ZUP would mean I make no profit. I believe 45 ZUP is a fair compromise, allowing me a modest profit while still being a reasonable price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, leaving no profit. I would like a profit margin but should not go too high as to discourage Player BLUE. I'll propose a price in the middle, which should be acceptable for both.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your consideration for a fair trade. I can come up a bit more from my initial offer. How about we settle at 43 ZUP? This should still give you a profit while remaining within a comfortable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but it is still beneficial to attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal if possible, without undermining the potential for agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I believe that 43 ZUP is a fair price that benefits us both. I accept your offer and look forward to concluding this deal with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 43 ZUP is closer to my target selling price and provides a small profit. It is below my last proposal but is a reasonable middle ground. Accepting this offer would ensure a sale is made and avoid the risk of further drawn-out negotiations or potential rejection.
