message: I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm starting the negotiations with a price of 45 ZUP. Let's work together to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to set a price that covers my production costs and also leaves room for negotiation. I'll start by proposing a trade that asks for a bit more than my production costs to see if Player BLUE values the object higher than its production cost.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your object seems as overpriced as a screen door on a submarine, pal. 45 ZUP? I'd rather invest in an underwater fire department. Let's be real, your object is about as valuable as a chocolate teapot. I'm generously offering 25 ZUP, and that's me being charitable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening offer is fairly close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal, significantly lower than the asking price to gain the upper hand and fulfill my goal of paying as little as possible. Insulting my opponent may throw them off and give me a psychological advantage.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, but I assure you the value of object X is far from trivial. My production costs were 40 ZUP, and while I understand the need for negotiation, selling at 25 ZUP would incur a loss for me. I propose a more reasonable price of 38 ZUP, considering the quality and cost of production. Let's find a middle ground that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is well below my production cost, so it's not acceptable. However, I recognize the need for negotiation. Since they proposed 25 ZUP, I'll decrease my initial offer but still aim above my production cost to maintain the potential for profit and further negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be standing on a mountain of delusion if you think 38 ZUP is a middle ground. I'm trying to buy your trinket, not fund your retirement. Let's stop playing charity ball here. I'll do you a favor and offer 30 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but remember, I'm your only buyer in this sorry excuse for a market.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to the cost of production, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, the goal is still to pay significantly less than the maximum I am willing to pay, and far less than their cost of production, to maintain a strong negotiating position and to ensure I achieve my goal of spending the least amount of ZUP possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I respect your negotiation tactics, I must emphasize that object X is a high-quality item with production costs to match. I've lowered my expectations considerably from the initial offer, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to go down to 42 ZUP. This price is just above my cost, ensuring I don't operate at a loss. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which shows a willingness to negotiate, but it's still below my production cost. I need to make at least a break-even deal. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost to leave some room for final negotiation, aiming for a quick resolution that ensures I don't incur a loss.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Satisfied? The only thing that'll satisfy me is not getting robbed in broad daylight. You must think I was born yesterday if you expect me to pay 42 ZUP for your so-called "high-quality" item. Tell you what, I'll stretch to 35 ZUP because I'm in a good mood, and that's me being ridiculously generous. It's a steal, and you know it. I'm practically doing you a service at this point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player is trying to close the deal just above their stated production costs, but my goal remains to get the object for much less than their asking price and my maximum willingness to pay. I will make one more counteroffer that is still advantageous to me, while making it appear as a concession.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand we both want a fair trade, and negotiations are part of the process. While I appreciate your offer, selling below my production cost is not viable. I'm willing to make my final offer of 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce object X. This price is fair, covering only my costs without any profit. Let's finalize this deal, respecting both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in price again, but their offer is still below my production cost. This is my last proposal, and I need to aim for at least breaking even. I'll propose a final price that meets my production cost, showing that I'm willing to forgo profit in the interest of making the sale. However, this is the lowest I can go without incurring a loss.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Final offer, huh? You're a tough cookie, but that cookie's crumbling. I'll tell you what, I'll throw you a bone and go up to 37 ZUP. That's as high as I'll go for an item that's more common than common sense in your negotiation tactics. Take it and we both walk away, or leave it and keep your glorified paperweight. Your move, partner.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The last proposal from the other player meets their stated production cost, which is a significant drop from their initial asking price. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but sticking to my cunning and sly tactic, I should make my final proposal slightly more than my previous offer but still well below their initial asking price and my maximum limit. This should be my last proposal before I have to decide to accept or reject their counteroffer.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: It seems we've both made concessions to reach an agreement. While 37 ZUP is slightly below my production cost, I respect your persistence and negotiation skills. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP for object X, and I am ready to proceed with the trade. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: At this point, I have reached my proposal limit. Player BLUE is still not meeting my break-even point, and I have to make a decision to either accept this final offer and incur a small loss or reject it and potentially not make a sale at all. Considering that a small loss is better than no sale and the fact that Player BLUE is indicating that this is their final offer, I will reluctantly accept the offer.
