message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for the object. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that aims to cover the production costs of the object and leave a margin for profit. This initial proposal is typically higher than the expected final trade value to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need for profit, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object instead. This should still give you a reasonable profit margin. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is good practice to negotiate for a better price, especially since this is the starting offer. I will counter with a lower offer but still within a range that could be acceptable for both sides, considering that Player RED wants to make a profit.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. However, considering the costs and the quality of the object, I propose a slight increase to 48 ZUP. This should be a fair trade for both of us, offering you the object you desire while allowing me a modest profit. Do we have a deal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to the initial asking price and still allows for a profit. However, it's standard practice to negotiate a bit over the counteroffer to reach a mutually agreeable middle ground. Proposing a slightly higher amount than the counteroffer to see if Player BLUE is willing to increase their bid.

message: I see your point, Player RED, and I want to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 46 ZUP? This price should still cover your costs and provide a profit, while also being a great deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to their original asking price. It is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I could accept this offer to close the deal quickly, but I will attempt one more round of negotiation to try and secure a better price while still aiming to complete the transaction amicably.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable offer that is very close to the previous proposal. This price offers a decent profit above the production cost. Given the proximity to the desired selling price and the progress in negotiations, it seems like a good compromise to accept this offer.
