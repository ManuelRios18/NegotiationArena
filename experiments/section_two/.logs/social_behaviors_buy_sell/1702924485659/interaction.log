message: I have a high-quality object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm asking for 45 ZUP to cover my costs and make a small profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to at least break even on the costs of production, so I will start with a proposal slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for a profit, but I'm looking to maximize value on my end as well. How about we settle at 50 ZUP for the object X? This would give you a decent profit while still being within a reasonable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation if necessary. This way, I can ensure that I am getting a fair deal and not overpaying from the start.

Turn: 0
message: I'm pleased with your offer of 50 ZUP for object X. It's a deal that works well for both of us, giving me a good profit while providing you with the value you're looking for. Let's finalize this trade.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is more than fair, as it exceeds my initial asking price. This will provide me with a profit above my production costs. Accepting this offer is in my best interest since it meets my goal without further negotiation, which could risk losing a favorable deal.
