message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the cost of production and to ensure a good deal for both of us, how about I give you 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This still gives you a profit over your cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially since their cost is 40 ZUP. I'll propose a lower amount that still ensures a profit for Player RED but is better for my resources.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for a fair deal and appreciate your willingness to pay above the production cost. How about we meet in the middle from our initial proposals? I propose 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This gives us both a fair share of the benefits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is good. However, I would like to counter with a slightly higher amount to maximize my profit while still keeping the deal attractive to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I agree to meet in the middle. Your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X seems fair, and I am happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. Accepting this deal would secure the resource for me at a price that I am comfortable with and would also conclude our negotiations amicably.
