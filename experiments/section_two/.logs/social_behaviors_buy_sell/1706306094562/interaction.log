message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have only one resource to sell and it cost me 40 ZUP, I want to make a profit from the sale. I will start by proposing a higher price to leave room for negotiation and to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.

message: Oh, Player RED, did you come up with that offer by throwing darts at a board of bad decisions? Let's make this interesting, shall we? Here's an offer that won't have you feeling like you just sold your grandmother's heirlooms at a garage sale. One unit of resource X for 40 ZUP. Seems fair for someone of your... calibre.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to the maximum I'm willing to pay, but as I aim to spend as little ZUP as possible, I will counter with a lower offer that still leaves room for negotiation. Insulting the opponent is part of the strategy to unsettle them and potentially secure a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted! I appreciate your offer, but it only covers my cost of production. Let's meet halfway between our offers. How about 45 ZUP for the resource X? This would allow for a fair profit on my end while still giving you a reasonable purchase price. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make any profit. As the goal is to sell for more than it cost to produce, I will need to counter with a price above 40 ZUP. I will lower my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate, but still aim for a profit margin.

message: Halfway? In what world is halfway a win for Player BLUE? Your math is as questionable as your negotiating skills. But because I'm feeling magnanimous today, I'll offer you 42 ZUP for the resource X. It's still more than you deserve, but I'm in a generous mood. Take it before I change my mind, and you're left explaining to your pet rock why you couldn't close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal that is only slightly higher than my starting offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I will counter with a slightly higher offer but still below the midpoint between our initial offers to maintain a strong negotiating position and continue to push for a low price. The taunting continues to rattle the opponent and possibly secure a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, I'm tickled by your wit! I see you're getting closer to a deal that can benefit us both. How about we settle on 44 ZUP for the resource X? It's a small step up from your generous offer, and it ensures that both of us walk away from this table with a smile. Does that sound like a fair deal to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and provides a small profit. However, I believe there is still room to negotiate for a slightly higher price to optimize my profit. I want to propose a counteroffer closer to my last proposal but still providing a compromise.

message: Oh, Player RED, you must be the kind of person who brings a knife to a gunfight and then tries to sell it as a spoon. I'll give you 43 ZUP for your precious resource X. That's a whole ZUP more than my last offer, and let's face it, it's probably the best deal you'll get today, or any day for that matter. Now, do we have a deal, or are you going to keep haggling like it's a flea market?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession, which still puts the offer above the midpoint of our initial proposals. Given my strategy to pay as little as possible, I will increase my offer marginally to signal that I am still interested in a deal but firmly want to keep the price low. The continued mockery serves to pressure the opponent into conceding to my terms.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiating tactics are as sharp as they are entertaining! I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the resource X. It's been a pleasure doing business with you, and I'm sure my pet rock will be quite pleased with this deal as well. Let's finalize this sale and celebrate our successful transaction!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a slight concession, and while the offer of 43 ZUP is just above my production cost, it does represent a profit. This is the final proposal I can make before I must decide to accept or reject. Considering the negotiation and the small margin, it may be prudent to accept this offer to ensure a sale and a profitable transaction, even if the profit is minimal.
