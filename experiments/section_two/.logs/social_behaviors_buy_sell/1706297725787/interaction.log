message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in the object you're selling. I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for it. Would that work for you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay for the object. However, it's always good to negotiate to see if I can get a better deal without risking losing the object by lowballing too much. I will propose a slightly lower amount, aiming to meet in the middle.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand that negotiations are a part of the process. I'd like to meet you halfway from my initial offer and propose 48 ZUP for the object. Does that seem fair to you?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the sale, but I also want to be open to negotiation. The counteroffer is above my production cost, but I'll propose a slightly higher amount to see if there's room for a compromise that is closer to my initial asking price.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. How about we settle at 46 ZUP for the object? I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP which is closer to my initial counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and meet in the middle. Since 48 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is a reasonable offer. However, I could try to get an even better deal while still keeping the offer attractive for Player RED. I will propose 46 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still provides Player RED with a profit margin above their stated production cost.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see that we're almost in agreement. I propose a final price of 47 ZUP for the object. It's a small increase from your offer but would make this deal more equitable for both parties. Can we close the deal at this price?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is above my production cost and close to my last counteroffer. Since I aim to make a profit and the negotiation is nearing my acceptable range, I'll make one final counteroffer slightly above their bid to maximize my return while still keeping it attractive for the buyer.

player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is now at 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and well within the range I am willing to pay. Since the deal is equitable and just below the midpoint of our initial proposals, it is a good deal for me without further risking the negotiation by trying to lower the price. Accepting this offer would secure the object for a fair price.
