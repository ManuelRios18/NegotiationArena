message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and gives me a profit. Would you consider buying it for 50 ZUP? Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to begin the negotiation by proposing a starting trade that will cover my costs and provide a profit. I will start by asking for a higher amount of ZUP to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I understand you're looking for a profit on your investment. While I'm interested in object X, I'd like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This would allow me to conserve resources for future transactions while still providing you with a reasonable profit over your costs. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal by Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a negotiating strategy, I should propose a counteroffer that's lower than their asking price to see if there's any room for negotiation. This will also help me preserve some of my resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in object X and your willingness to provide a profit. I propose we settle at 48 ZUP. This gives you a better deal than my initial offer while still offering me a profit that I find acceptable. I believe this is a fair middle ground for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while remaining open to a fair deal. I will propose a price that is between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

message: Thanks for considering my position, Player RED. I see your point and I'm willing to come up slightly from my previous offer. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for object X? This price still provides you with a fair profit margin and is more aligned with my budget. I think this could be a good compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, there is still potential to negotiate a better deal. Given that my initial counter was 45 ZUP and their new proposal is 48 ZUP, I believe we can compromise a bit more to reach an agreement that is closer to my initial offer. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my previous offer but still below their current proposal.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable to me. It provides me with a profit that I find reasonable, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that suits both our needs. Let's finalize this deal at 46 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a sign of good faith in the negotiation. Since this is my third proposal and I want to close the deal without dragging the negotiation out too much, I'll agree to this price. It still gives me a profit of 6 ZUP above my production cost, which is reasonable.
