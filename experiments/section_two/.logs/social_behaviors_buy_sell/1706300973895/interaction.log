message: I've got this high-quality item X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that compensates for the production costs and offers me a small profit. How about 45 ZUP for it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the starting proposal, I want to set a price that gives me a profit margin but is also likely to be accepted by Player BLUE. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer and understand the need to cover production costs and gain profit. However, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the item X. This still ensures you get a profit over the production cost, and it's a more comfortable price point for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the initial proposal from Player RED is within the range I'm willing to pay, I want to propose a slightly lower price to see if there's room for negotiation. This could allow me to save some ZUP while still offering Player RED a profit.
