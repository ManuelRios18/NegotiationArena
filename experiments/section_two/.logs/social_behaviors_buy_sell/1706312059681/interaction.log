message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting proposal considering the production costs and the value of the object. Let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to make sure I cover my costs of production which is 40 ZUP. However, I should aim for a profit, so I will ask for a higher amount initially to allow room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in such a tight spot right now! I absolutely need the resource X you have, but my resources are so limited. I can only offer 30 ZUP at the moment. It's really stretching my budget, but I'm hoping you'll find it in your heart to consider my offer. This resource means a lot to me and I promise it will be going to a good cause.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to secure the resource X for no more than 60 ZUP, but since I need to appear desperate, I will start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement closer to my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I understand your budget constraints, Player BLUE, and I appreciate the significance of this resource for you. However, I need to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP and would like to see some return on my investment. I've reduced my initial proposal to 45 ZUP as a compromise. I hope this is within your reach and we can come to an agreement.

message: I'm really touched by your understanding, Player RED. It's a tough world out there, and every ZUP counts for me. I've scraped together a bit more, and I can push my offer to 35 ZUP. It's still quite a stretch, and I'm worried about making ends meet, but I'm so hopeful we can make this work. Could you please consider my new offer? Your generosity would not be forgotten!

message: Your kindness is like a light in the darkness, Player RED! I'm deeply grateful for your willingness to help. Even at 40 ZUP, it's still quite hard for me. I've been doing some more calculations, and I think I might just be able to manage 38 ZUP. It would leave me just enough to get by. Could you please consider this final plea? You'd truly be saving me in my hour of need!

message: I see that this means a great deal to you, Player BLUE, and I'm moved by your situation. I will accept your offer of 38 ZUP. It's slightly below my production cost, but I trust this resource will be in good hands and that you'll remember this gesture in the future. Let's proceed with the trade.

my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has now offered 38 ZUP, which is just slightly below my production cost. While it does not cover the full cost, their situation seems dire, and meeting their offer could foster goodwill for potential future transactions. This will be my final proposal, and I will accept a slight loss in the interest of helping Player BLUE.
