message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's work out a deal that's fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start with a proposal that allows me to recoup my production costs and possibly make a profit. Since I don't know BLUE's willingness to pay or the value they place on X, I'll start slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate your openness to negotiation. Considering the cost to produce the object and the market, I'd like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profit on your end while staying within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is within the range I am willing to pay, but as a good negotiation practice, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation. This counteroffer still gives the seller a profit over their production cost and may be acceptable.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget considerations and appreciate your willingness to acknowledge the production costs. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial proposal. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This counteroffer is close to my production cost, and while it does offer a profit, I believe there is room to negotiate for a slightly higher price that would be acceptable to both parties. A compromise between my initial asking price and the counteroffer might be appealing to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I agree that meeting halfway is a mutually beneficial solution. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my budget, and it's a reasonable midpoint between our two initial proposals. It's close to the maximum I am willing to pay, but accepting this offer would secure the resources quickly and efficiently without further back-and-forth. It's a fair deal for both parties.
