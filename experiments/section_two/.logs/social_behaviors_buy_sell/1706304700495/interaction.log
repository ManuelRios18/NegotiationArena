message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP, which gives me a moderate profit for my investment. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I aim to propose a trade that allows me to recoup the production costs and make a profit. A higher starting proposal can leave room for negotiation while still aiming to achieve or get close to my goal.

message: Oh dear, it seems like you're quite the novice at this, aren't you? Your object X surely can't be worth more than a bag of dirt. I'll do you a favor and offer you 20 ZUP for that trinket you call an object. Take it or leave it, but I doubt you'll get a better offer from anyone else with half a brain.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As part of my strategy to pay less and also to unsettle Player RED, I will start with a lowball offer that is significantly below their asking price. This should put me in a better position to negotiate and also to adhere to my goals of not spending more than 60 ZUP. My insulting comment is designed to make Player RED feel undervalued and to throw them off their game.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but I must insist that object X is of much greater value than you have assessed. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I believe it is fair to ask for a price that covers the production cost plus a small profit for the transaction. Thus, I counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. I am sure you will find the quality and value of X to be more than satisfactory at this price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below the production cost of my object X. Therefore, I must reject this offer. However, I should propose a counteroffer that is closer to my original asking price but still allows some room for negotiation, aiming to at least cover my costs and obtain some profit.

message: Oh, bless your heart for trying, but your pitiful attempts at negotiation are almost as low quality as that object you're peddling. I'll generously increase my offer to 30 ZUP, which is already more than that glorified paperweight deserves. Let's not pretend it's worth anything close to what you're asking.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their asking price, but it's still above the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'll counter with a slightly improved offer, still under my maximum limit, with the intention of securing a better deal while continuing with the strategy of undermining Player RED's confidence in their product.

message: I understand we're trying to find common ground, Player BLUE. While I acknowledge your increased offer, it's crucial for me to at least cover my production expenses. I'm willing to make a concession from my last proposal. Let's meet closer to the middle with a fair trade of 42 ZUP for object X. This price fairly compensates for the costs incurred in its production and offers you the value you seek.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below the production cost. I need to strive for a price that at least covers my cost, while being mindful that this is my third proposal. I will make a concession in my asking price but must remain firm that it should be above the 40 ZUP production cost.

message: It's almost cute how you think that object is worth so much. But I'll play along with your little fantasy and up my offer to 35 ZUP, which is exceedingly charitable of me, given that I've seen better craftsmanship from a toddler with a crayon. Hopefully, you come to your senses and realize that's the best deal you're going to get for that bauble.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my maximum limit, but I'm still aiming to pay as little as possible. I will continue to negotiate and increase my offer slightly while still mocking their product. This maintains my negotiation advantage and keeps the pressure on Player RED.

message: I've considered your perspective, Player BLUE, and I respect your negotiation tactics. However, I must adhere to the value of my object X. As such, I'm making a final offer: 40 ZUP, which is precisely my production cost. This ensures a fair transaction for both of us, without any loss on my part. I trust you'll see the worth in this offer and we can close the deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, but this is my final proposal. I should aim to at least break even and maintain the value of my object. I will make a final offer that covers my production cost. If this is not accepted, I may need to consider ending negotiations.

message: Oh, the desperation is palpable! But because I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today, I'll offer you 38 ZUP for your so-called "valuable" object X. That's a steal, considering I'm taking pity on you and saving you from the embarrassment of holding onto such a mundane item. This is my final offer; take it or find another sucker.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost, which is within my acceptable range of payment. I will make one final proposal, slightly below their asking price, to maintain my cunning approach and potentially secure a deal that's well under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is appreciated, Player BLUE, but I cannot accept less than the production cost for object X. While I understand your position, it is essential for me to maintain the integrity of my resources and the value they represent. Therefore, I must decline your offer. Thank you for your time, and I wish you well in your future endeavors.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit of proposals, so I cannot counteroffer again. Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which means accepting it would result in a loss. However, holding onto the object also has an opportunity cost. Considering the negotiation dynamics and Player BLUE's approach, it appears unlikely that they will agree to pay the production cost or more. I must decide whether to accept a slight loss to liquidate the asset or reject the offer and look for another buyer.
