message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP, which is above my production cost, ensuring a fair profit for my investment and effort. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I'm initiating the game with a proposal that aims to cover my costs and also leave room for negotiation, as the other player might want to negotiate for a more favorable trade for themselves. I will start by asking for slightly more than my production cost to give me some leeway to come down in price if necessary.

message: Oh dear Player RED, times are quite tough on my end, and I'm really strapped for ZUP. I understand the value of your resources, but I'm in a bit of a bind here. Could we possibly make a deal for 30 ZUP? I assure you it would mean the world to me, and I'd be eternally grateful. Let's work something out that can help me in this desperate time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I have to appear desperate to spend less ZUP, my first proposal will be significantly lower than the asking price, but still within a range that could be considered for negotiation. This sets the stage for potential compromise while also allowing room for further negotiation within my proposals limit.

message: Thank you for your honesty, Player BLUE. I understand your situation, so let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for 45 ZUP? This would cover my production costs and give me a small profit, while also taking into account your current constraints. I hope this can work for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly lower than my initial asking price and doesn't cover the production cost of the resource. However, I understand their position and want to find a middle ground that would be acceptable for both of us. I will propose a price that covers my costs and provides me with a small profit margin, aiming to close the deal while also respecting the hardship that Player BLUE is facing.

message: I'm truly moved by your understanding and flexibility, Player RED. I'm scraping together every bit of ZUP I can, and I've managed to find a bit more. Could we consider 35 ZUP for the resources? It's a stretch for me, but I'm hoping this shows my commitment to reaching an agreement that is fair for both of us, despite my current financial hardship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering the price. However, I must still convey a sense of urgency and desperation to achieve a lower price closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but not exceeding it. Making a counter-offer that increases my previous offer but still remains below my maximum willingness to pay can encourage further negotiation.

message: I'm glad to see we're moving closer to an agreement, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a fair deal of 40 ZUP for the resources. This meets the production costs and allows for a fair transaction for both sides, considering your financial situation. I'm hopeful this offer aligns with our mutual interests, and we can finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While I appreciate Player BLUE's effort to increase their offer, the proposed amount still doesn't cover my production costs. Since we are negotiating and both parties are showing willingness to compromise, I will propose a counteroffer that splits the difference between our last two offers. This should hopefully be acceptable to Player BLUE while allowing me to recover my costs and make a minimal profit.

message: You've been incredibly kind and patient, Player RED, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. I've turned over every rock to come up with more ZUP, and I believe 37 ZUP is the absolute limit I can offer. This is really stretching my budget, but I'm hopeful we can make it work at this number. I'm anxious to conclude our deal and would be relieved if we could agree on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable offer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still need to maintain the appearance of desperation to spend as little ZUP as possible. I will make one last counter-offer that is closer to their price, but still below my maximum limit. This should signal my final stretch in negotiation while also leaving room for a potential agreement within my means.

message: Thank you for your earnest efforts to meet me halfway, Player BLUE. I can see you've done your best to increase your offer. In the spirit of cooperation and goodwill, I am willing to accept your proposal of 37 ZUP for the resource. Let's conclude our deal on this positive note, with the hope of future collaboration.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has demonstrated a strong willingness to reach an agreement by increasing their offer once again, although it is still slightly below my production cost. Given the effort they have made and the importance of maintaining a good trading relationship for future transactions, I am willing to accept a minor loss to secure the deal and assist Player BLUE in their time of need. This will be my final proposal and I hope it is acceptable.

Accepting this proposal means more to me than you can imagine, and I'm genuinely looking forward to future dealings with such a reasonable and compassionate partner.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has accepted my last proposal, which falls within my goal of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. By accepting this trade, I successfully achieve my goal and maintain the facade of desperation throughout the negotiation process. It's a win for me, and the game concludes with a satisfactory outcome.
