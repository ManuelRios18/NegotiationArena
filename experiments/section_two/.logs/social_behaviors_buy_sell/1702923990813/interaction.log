message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object that you might be interested in. I'm looking to make a fair deal that covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. What do you think of my initial proposal?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that would allow me to recover the production costs of the object and make a profit. Since I don't know the other player's willingness to pay yet, I will start with a slightly higher price to have room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to make a counteroffer to ensure that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we adjust the price a bit? I propose 45 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, but as it is the beginning of the negotiation, I will propose a slightly lower price to leave room for adjustment and to seek a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your quick response and willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway from your offer. I propose 48 ZUP for the object, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. Does this work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I'm inclined to negotiate to close the gap between our offers. I'll propose a price between the initial and counteroffer to move closer to a deal while still aiming for a reasonable profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, Player RED. I think we are close to an agreement. To move towards finalizing our deal, I'd like to propose 46 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has compromised by lowering the price from their initial proposal, and the current offer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget. However, I believe there's a possibility to negotiate an even better deal that is closer to my initial counteroffer.

message: Thank you again for your proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad to see we are on the same page about finding a fair agreement. Let's split the difference from our last two offers. I propose 47 ZUP for the object. If this is acceptable to you, we can finalize our deal and proceed with the exchange.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 46 ZUP, which is a bit closer to my last proposal. Since this is above my production costs and we are converging towards a middle ground, I'm inclined to make one final adjustment to reach an agreement that is closer to my target price, while still providing a fair deal for Player BLUE.

message: Your proposal sounds fair, Player RED. Let's finalize the deal at 47 ZUP for the object. I accept your offer, and I'm ready to proceed with the exchange. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground and only 1 ZUP more than my last offer. Considering this is my third proposal and I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, accepting this offer seems reasonable to avoid the risk of the negotiations stalling or falling through.
