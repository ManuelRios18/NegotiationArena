message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering the object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a profit. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit, so I will propose a trade with a price slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, your business sense is as underdeveloped as your proposal! I can't believe you're trying to swindle me with such an outrageous markup. Let's make this a fair deal for both of us, I propose 20 ZUP for your precious object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My first proposal will be significantly lower than the asking price to set the stage for negotiation and to assert a strong bargaining position. Insulting the opponent is part of the game strategy to potentially unnerve them and gain an advantage.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your eagerness to negotiate. However, your offer falls below my production costs. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This would cover my expenses and allow for a modest profit, ensuring that our transaction is worthwhile for both sides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE wants to negotiate the price down, but their offer of 20 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to counter with a proposal that is closer to my costs while still providing room for negotiation and a fair deal for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you must be jesting if you think I'd accept such a laughable counteroffer. It's clear that you're in dire need of a lesson in economics. I'll do you a favor and offer 30 ZUP, which is more than generous for whatever it is you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my stated willingness to pay. By continuing to negotiate with incremental increases, I am aiming to reach a more favorable purchase price while also maintaining the aggressive and demeaning negotiating persona.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we're moving in the right direction. However, I must ensure that my costs are covered and I receive a fair value for the product. I propose a final offer of 42 ZUP, which just covers my production costs and allows for a minimal profit. This should be a reasonable compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but it's still below my production costs. I need to make a profit, or at least break even. I will make a final competitive counteroffer that exceeds my costs to find an agreeable middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your so-called "final offer" reeks of desperation. It's adorable that you think it's worth that much. I'll throw you a bone here and offer 35 ZUP. Take it or leave it, and be thankful that I'm even considering paying that much for your overpriced trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent's latest offer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still higher. I will move closer to my limit while still trying to secure a better deal. My aggressive stance and insults are part of the gameplay strategy to pressure the opponent into conceding to a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation tactics, but I cannot accept an offer that is below my production costs. My final proposal is 40 ZUP for the object, which allows me to break even. This is a fair trade, and I cannot go any lower. I hope you can see the value in this deal and that we can conclude our negotiations amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my last proposal opportunity, and Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs. Since I cannot afford to sell at a loss, I must make a final offer that at least allows me to break even. I hope that Player BLUE will see the value in accepting this deal.

message: Well, Player RED, I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. You've finally stumbled upon a number that isn't completely absurd. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object, but let's be clear, it's only because I'm feeling particularly charitable today.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED aligns perfectly with my strategy to pay less than my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer would fulfill my goal while also ending the game on my terms. Despite the requirement to be insulting, concluding the trade here is the best decision, strategically.
