message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm proposing a fair trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with a proposal that covers my costs and leaves room for negotiation, so I will propose a trade above my production costs but still reasonable to attract Player BLUE's interest.

message: Oh dear RED, I'm afraid your grasp of 'fair' trade is as tenuous as a house of cards in a hurricane. Let's be serious; your object is about as valuable as a pebble on the roadside. Be grateful I'm generous enough to offer you 25 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but I suggest you take it before I find your resource by the wayside for free.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I want to spend much less ZUP and also humiliate my opponent, I will propose a significantly lower trade offer than what they're asking for, to undermine their expectations and assert dominance in the negotiation.

message: Player BLUE, while I appreciate your spirited negotiation, I must cover my costs and make a modest profit. I've reconsidered and propose a trade of 35 ZUP for my resource X. This is a more balanced offer, reflecting both the cost of production and its value. Let's find a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is less than my production costs. I must propose a trade that is closer to my costs while still leaving room for profit. A counter in the middle ground seems reasonable, it gives us space to negotiate further while signaling I am flexible but also need to cover my costs.

message: Your 'modest profit' seems as overblown as your estimation of worth, RED. It's almost as if you think your resource has the allure of a rare gem when in reality, it's more akin to a common rock. I'll extend my offer to 28 ZUP, out of sheer benevolence. Consider it a charity for the delusional.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their price, which is a move in the right direction, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than before to show some movement but still aim to pay well below my maximum threshold, all while maintaining my derisive attitude.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your perspective, but we must both consider the reality of the costs involved. I'm sure you can recognize the value of a fair deal. I have come down significantly from my initial offer and propose a trade of 42 ZUP for my resource X. This offer barely covers my production costs and allows for the smallest of margins. I believe this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering less than my costs. However, they did increase their offer, which shows willingness to negotiate. I should make a counteroffer that gets me closer to my production cost while conceding a bit more to signal my willingness to come to an agreement. Aiming for a figure just above my costs could be a fair compromise.

message: RED, your sob story about costs is as touching as a cactus. I must commend your persistence; it's the only thing more inflated than your prices. But let's not dance around the issue. I'll offer you a final charitable sum of 30 ZUP. Consider this a lesson in economics from a master to an amateur.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my ideal price range, but I'll stick to my strategy of offering less. I'll continue to push for a lower price and keep up the pressure with my demeaning attitude, attempting to get them to settle for less than they want.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are noted. I propose we cut to the chase with a final offer that covers just my production costs: 40 ZUP for my resource X. This is the most equitable resolution, ensuring neither of us walks away at a disadvantage. Let's conclude this deal with mutual respect for our economic acumen.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. This is my final proposal, and I need to make it count. I'll propose a trade that meets my production costs to ensure I do not incur a loss. Given the back and forth, meeting at my cost gives Player BLUE a sense of victory while ensuring I'm not at a loss.

message: Oh, RED, you almost had me with your plea for fairness, almost. But I can't shake this feeling of generosity towards the less fortunate in negotiation skills. I'll sweeten my previous act of kindness and put forth 32 ZUP. Take this offer, and let's end this charade of yours pretending to hold the upper hand.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. While Player RED's offer aligns with their stated production costs, I will make one last attempt to secure the resource for less than their bottom line, which is still within my maximum threshold. I'll keep the pressure up with my demeaning attitude.

message: Player BLUE, while your offer is appreciated, I cannot accept a deal that results in a loss for me. I must stay true to the economics of my situation. Therefore, I must respectfully decline your offer.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs. Since I have already offered my final proposal and it's my fourth, I cannot propose another trade. Therefore, I must decide whether to accept or reject their offer. Accepting it would mean incurring a loss, which goes against my goals.
