message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 45 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering the production costs. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I want to propose a trade that is slightly above my cost to leave room for negotiation but also show that I am serious about making a fair trade.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your costs and appreciate the fair starting point. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the object X, aligning with your production costs. I believe this is also a fair deal that allows us both to benefit from this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is beneficial in negotiations to counter with an offer slightly lower than what is presented to see if thereâ€™s room to save some resources while still reaching an agreement. Therefore, I will counter with an offer of 40 ZUP, which is exactly how much it cost Player RED to produce the object. This gives room for negotiation but also shows I am interested in a fair deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're on the same page regarding the production costs. To meet halfway, I propose a trade of 42 ZUP for object X. This would give me a small margin while still being a reasonable deal for you. I hope this compromise is acceptable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's understanding of my costs and their willingness to offer a trade that covers my production costs. However, I would like to make a slight profit on this transaction. I'll make a counteroffer that is a compromise between my initial asking price and their counteroffer. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a small profit margin.

message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player RED. The offer of 42 ZUP for object X seems like a fair compromise. I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is a reasonable counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Since we're now close to a deal and to show good faith in the negotiation, I will accept this offer. It allows Player RED to make a small profit and meets my objective of acquiring the object for less than 60 ZUP.
