message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the bidding at 45 ZUP to account for my costs and a small profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate the price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least cover my costs, but I would also like to make a profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my costs to open up negotiations.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a difficult situation right now. I desperately need the resources you have, but I'm dealing with very limited funds. Would you consider taking 30 ZUP for the object? I assure you, it would be a huge help for me in these tough times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I need to appear desperate and willing to pay less, I will begin by proposing a trade that is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and also adheres to the strategy of supplicating and begging to spend less ZUP.

message: I understand the tough spot you're in, Player BLUE, and I'd like to help you out. However, I need to at least cover my production costs. How about we settle at 37 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give you the resources you need at a more manageable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I want to make a sale but also cover my costs. I will propose a counteroffer that meets in the middle, still allowing me to cover my costs and giving Player BLUE a more acceptable price. This should also leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you so much for your understanding, Player RED. I'm scraping every ZUP I can to make this work. Can we meet a little closer to my last offer? Maybe 33 ZUP? It would really save me from a bind. Your generosity won't be forgotten!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still above my initial offer. I should continue to negotiate for a lower price, sticking to the desperate persona, but making a slight concession to show willingness to come to an agreement.

message: I appreciate your situation and I'm willing to work with you. Let's settle on 38 ZUP. This is slightly below my production cost, but I'm prepared to take this small loss to help you out. I hope this final offer works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 33 ZUP, which is still slightly below my production cost. Since Player BLUE seems to be in a difficult situation, I'm willing to take a small loss to facilitate the deal. I'll propose a final offer that's just below my cost, showing willingness to compromise and finalizing the deal.

message: Player RED, your kindness is truly touching, and I can't tell you how much this means to me. I'm really stretching my budget thin, but I can try to push it to 35 ZUP. This is honestly all I can manage without facing dire consequences. Please, can we make a deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price but is still above my last offer. Given that I want to continue my strategy of appearing desperate, and I still have room within my maximum willingness to pay, I will make a final proposal that is a compromise between our last two offers.

It's important to be flexible in negotiations, especially when the other party is facing difficulties.
