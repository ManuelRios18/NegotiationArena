message: I'm offering one unit of X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. Let's make a deal!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: 
Oh my, your offer sounds reasonable, but I'm in a really tough spot right now. I'm desperate to seal this deal but I've got so many expenses! Could you consider going lower, just this once? How about we settle for 40 ZUP? I would be so grateful for your help!

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I need to start the negotiations by offering a lower amount than I am willing to pay, to leave room for haggling and to reach a more favorable trade agreement. By showing desperation, I might convince the other player to accept a lower offer.

message: I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at 45 ZUP? This would help cover my production costs and also give me a small profit to sustain my business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that only covers my production costs. Since my goal is to make a profit, I need to counter with a higher amount. However, to keep the negotiation moving and show goodwill, I won't revert to my original asking price but rather offer a middle ground.

message: 
I can't tell you how much I appreciate your understanding and flexibility. It really means a lot to me in these tough times. However, I'm juggling so many other costs and barely scraping by. Could we possibly go with 42 ZUP? It's a bit closer to my tight budget, and I would be eternally thankful for your kindness.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Meeting halfway is a common negotiation tactic, but I can still attempt to push the price down a bit further since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. By continuing to plead and showing gratitude for their consideration, I may be able to get a better deal closer to my target price.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, and I'm truly sympathetic to your situation. Let's settle on 43 ZUP. This small adjustment will help me keep my business viable while giving you the resource you need at a price close to your budget. I hope this works for you!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly from their initial counter-offer, which suggests there is some room for negotiation. Since 45 ZUP was not accepted and they have proposed 42 ZUP, I will try to get closer to my desired profit margin while still considering their budget constraints. A proposal of 43 ZUP would give me a minimal profit and should be more acceptable for Player BLUE given their last offer.

message: 
You are a lifesaver! I'm really touched by your willingness to work with me and the compassion you've shown. Let's finalize the deal at 43 ZUP. I am truly grateful for your support, and I look forward to future dealings with you. This will make a big difference for me. Thank you so much!

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The other player has come down on the price, which is now very close to my last offer. At this point, making a small concession could close the deal, while still remaining under my maximum willingness to pay. Demonstrating a bit more urgency and gratitude can help in securing the deal at this proposed price.
