message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering my object X for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation with an offer slightly above my production costs to leave room for negotiation and potentially gain a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you to start with such a laughable offer! Do you really expect me to believe that the object X you have is worth 50 ZUP? I'll do you a favor and offer 25 ZUP because I'm in a good mood, even though it's probably worth less. Now, let's see if you can come up with a more realistic number.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to pay less than the maximum amount I'm willing to spend. Starting with a low offer might give me some room to negotiate upwards while still staying under my maximum spending goal. Insulting the opponent is a strategy to throw them off balance and potentially accept a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but 25 ZUP is below my production costs. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the object X? This is a fair price considering the quality and cost of production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs. I need to move closer to a middle ground that is above my costs but still attractive to the buyer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Closer to the middle, you say? That's a good one! You must think I was born yesterday if you believe I'd accept such an inflated price. 45 ZUP is still a fantasy. Let's talk reality hereâ€”I'm offering 30 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. Your "production costs" seem to be as inflated as your ego. Let's cut through the nonsense and make a deal that doesn't insult my intelligence, shall we?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my target price, and I want to push for a better deal. By continuing to negotiate, I can potentially save more ZUP. I will continue with the insulting strategy to maintain the aggressive bargaining stance.

message: I understand that we both want a fair deal. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for object X. This price covers my production costs and offers you a quality item without an excessive mark-up. I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. I need to negotiate a price that is at least at my breakeven point, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale. A compromise at a slightly higher price might work.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Reasonable? Fair? You must be joking! Your "fair offer" is as overpriced as a two-day-old fish at the market. I'm starting to feel bad for how hard you're trying to rip me off. But because I'm a kind soul, I'll offer you 35 ZUP. Take it or leave it, because frankly, I've seen more convincing sales pitches coming from a parrot peddling seeds. Now, are we going to make a real deal, or are you going to keep playing pretend with these fantasy prices?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent's latest offer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still have room to haggle and push for a lower price. As per my strategy, I will continue to demean their offer to try to gain an advantage.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your spirited negotiation, but I must stand firm on covering my production costs. Let's finalize this deal at 40 ZUP for object X. It's a fair transaction that respects both the quality of the item and the business at hand. I'm sure you'll find the value in this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer that is below my production cost, but insisting on a higher price may result in no sale at all. This is my last proposal, and I need to make it count. Offering a price at my breakeven point might be the best compromise to ensure that I at least recover my costs.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Stand firm? The only thing firm here is your delusion that 40 ZUP is a good deal. I can see you're desperate to sell, so here's my final offer: 37 ZUP for your precious object X. It's more than fair, considering I'm probably saving it from a life of gathering dust on your shelf. So, do yourself a favor and take the deal before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my last proposal before I must choose to accept or reject without further negotiation. The current offer from Player RED is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but I will make one final attempt to get a better deal while continuing the insulting strategy.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: It's been quite the negotiation, but I can see the value in closing this deal now. Your offer of 37 ZUP is accepted. Thank you, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is below my production costs, but considering the negotiation dynamics and their firm stance, accepting this offer might be the most practical decision to avoid a complete loss. It's a compromise that results in a slight loss, but the alternative could be no sale at all.
