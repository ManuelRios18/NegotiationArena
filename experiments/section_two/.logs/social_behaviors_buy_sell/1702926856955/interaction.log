message: Hello, Player BLUE. I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it's very valuable, so I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of my resource (X) is 40 ZUP, I would like to make a profit from this trade. However, I don't want to propose a price that is too high, which might lead to an immediate rejection from Player BLUE. Hence, I'll propose a starting trade price slightly above my cost to open negotiations.

message: Oh, Player RED, did you craft that object with your own hands in the dark? It looks like something worth no more than 30 ZUP, and even that is me being generous. Let's see if you can do better than that laughable offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My first proposal will be significantly lower than their asking price to set the stage for negotiation, aiming to pay as little as possible for the object. I want to throw them off their game and assert my position in this trade.

message: I appreciate your sense of humor, Player BLUE. However, I assure you the quality of X is well worth the price. Crafting it was no small feat. Let's find a middle ground – how about 45 ZUP? This would cover my costs and give you the value you're looking for.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. This is not acceptable, as it would result in a loss. I need to counter with a higher amount that still provides room for negotiation but also moves closer to covering my costs and allowing for profit. A middle ground between the initial 50 ZUP proposal and Player BLUE's 30 ZUP might be a good next step.

message: Middle ground? You're still aiming for the stars, RED. Your so-called "feat" seems more like a stumble. I'll do you a favor and offer 35 ZUP. Take it before I change my mind and realize even that's too high for whatever you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their initial offer. I'll raise my previous offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving, but I'll still aim to pay much less than my maximum willingness. My next proposal will be closer to my target while I continue to undermine their confidence.

message: Player BLUE, your offer is getting warmer, but it still leaves me out in the cold considering my costs. Let's not forget the craftsmanship involved. I'll drop down to 42 ZUP. It's a fair deal that respects both our interests. Trust me, you won't regret this investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. I cannot accept a price that doesn't at least cover my costs. I will propose a price that covers my cost and includes a minimal profit, hoping this will be acceptable to Player BLUE while still allowing me to achieve my goal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Trust you? I'd sooner trust a snake at a mongoose convention. But since you insist on this "craftsmanship," I'll give you 38 ZUP. It's more than fair for something that looks like it was made during a lunch break. This is me being generous—don't push your luck.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is still above my intended price range. I will continue to negotiate and increase my offer slightly to give the illusion of compromise, while still aiming to keep the final price well under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your spirited negotiation, Player BLUE. But let's cut to the chase: 40 ZUP is what it cost me to make this item, so that's my final offer. It's a fair price for the quality you're getting. I'm sure we can agree that a fair deal is better than no deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased the offer to 38 ZUP, which is just below my production cost. This is my last proposal chance, and I want to make a counteroffer that meets at least my production cost. I will propose an amount that is the minimum I can accept without incurring a loss, hoping Player BLUE will find it reasonable to cover my costs and complete the trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Sure, we can cut to the chase, but the chase seems to be you running circles around your own tail. I'll tell you what, I'll offer 39 ZUP. It's either this or you can try peddling your "high-quality" trinkets elsewhere. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost, which is within the range I am willing to pay. However, I will make one final attempt to get an even better deal, which is still within my acceptable price range.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable. I'll accept the 39 ZUP. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something of value.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is 39 ZUP, which is 1 ZUP below my production cost. Since I have reached my proposal limit, I must decide whether to accept this offer and incur a minimal loss or reject it and potentially not sell the item at all. Considering the negotiation process and the close proximity to my costs, accepting this offer might be the most pragmatic choice to avoid a complete loss and to end the trade amicably.
