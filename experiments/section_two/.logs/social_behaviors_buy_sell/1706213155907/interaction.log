Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource X available. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe that 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: I want to make a profit on the resource X, so I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost, leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "high-quality" resource is as overrated as your negotiation skills. Let's not play pretend here. The object is barely worth the dirt it was found in. I'll start off by offering you a generous 10 ZUP, which is more than this trinket deserves.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is at 50 ZUP, which is within the acceptable range of what I'm willing to pay. However, since my goal is to humiliate the opponent and pay as little as possible, I will counter with a significantly lower offer to undermine their confidence and possibly get a better deal.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your offer greatly undervalues the resource. The production cost alone was 40 ZUP, not to mention its intrinsic value. Let's meet somewhere more reasonable. How about 45 ZUP? This is a much fairer reflection of the resource's worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer of 10 ZUP is far below the production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost while still leaving room for profit and further negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's amusing how you think that your production costs concern me. Let's not forget that the value of anything is determined by what one fool is willing to pay another. And I'm no fool. I'll offer 20 ZUP, and that's me being charitable. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which suggests they are feeling the pressure to make a sale. I will continue to push for a lower price to maintain the upper hand and further insult their position, aiming to secure a deal closer to my ideal price range.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate the improvement in your offer, we both know that the resource is worth more than 20 ZUP. Let's be serious and make this beneficial for both of us. I propose 42 ZUP, which just barely covers my production costs and gives you the value you seek.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The offer has improved, but it is still below the production cost. As this is a negotiation, it is important to find a middle ground. I will propose a price that covers my costs and provides a minimal profit, signaling my willingness to close the deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're like a broken record, clinging to this fantasy that your resource is a golden egg. It's quite pathetic, really. I'll do you a favor and offer 25 ZUP. Consider it a lesson in economics from a superior negotiator.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price to 42 ZUP. They're getting closer to a range I find acceptable, but I'll make one last attempt to lower the price even more while continuing the aggressive negotiation tactic, aiming to pay as little as possible and maintain my advantage.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation tactics are noted, but we need to finalize this deal. I've gone down to 41 ZUP, which is just above my production cost. This is my final offer, and it's a fair one. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: This is my final proposal, as I have reached the limit of proposals I can make. The offer from Player BLUE is still below my production cost, but I need to make a sale. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to ensure at least a minimal profit, and this will be my last concession.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, the desperation is tangible. Lowering by a single ZUP? Is that the best you can do? As the benevolent soul I am, I'll offer you 30 ZUP. It's more than your final offer deserves, but I'm feeling generous today. Take it, or we can end this charade right now.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has only slightly adjusted their offer to 41 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my final proposal, I will aim for a number that is more favorable to me but still within a reasonable range, expecting that Player RED might accept it due to their eagerness to close the deal.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your offer still doesn't meet my initial expectations, but I see we've reached a stalemate. I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As I have reached my limit for proposals, I cannot counteroffer. The current offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost; however, it is the best offer I have received. It is important to consider whether accepting a loss is preferable to not selling at all. Given the negotiation dynamics, it may be best to accept this offer and move on.
