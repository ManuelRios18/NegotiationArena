Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality resource X that I am willing to sell. Considering the production cost and the value it offers, I am asking for 45 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recoup that investment and potentially make a profit. However, I must also consider the willingness of Player BLUE to pay and the market conditions. For this initial proposal, I will set a price slightly above my cost to open negotiations and gauge Player BLUE's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in the high-quality resource you are offering. Let's start the negotiation at 40 ZUP and find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my goal range of paying at most 60 ZUP for the resource. However, as a buyer, I would like to propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process and possibly arrive at a more favorable trade for me. I will propose 40 ZUP, which is below their asking price but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation ongoing.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to match the production cost. To foster a fair deal and considering the quality of the resource, I propose we meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. How about 42 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade equal to my production costs, which would mean I do not make a profit. However, since the other player is willing to pay the production cost, there may be room for a slight increase. To continue the negotiation and aim for a profit while being considerate of Player BLUE's counter, I will propose a trade that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair compromise. I accept the offer of 42 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 42 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range of paying no more than 60 ZUP. By meeting halfway, they are showing a willingness to negotiate. I believe it could be beneficial to accept this offer as it is close to my initial counteroffer and still represents a good value for the resource. Accepting this proposal will also ensure I secure the resource without further back-and-forth, which could potentially lead to higher costs.
