message: Hello, I've put a lot of effort into producing this high-quality resource. Considering the costs and the value it offers, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: For my first proposal, I want to start by asking for a bit more than what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows room for negotiation and also helps ensure I cover my costs and make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is as laughable as your negotiation skills. Did you really think I would fall for such a clumsy attempt? Let's cut to the chase: I'll give you a mere 10 ZUP for that trinket you call a high-quality resource. Take it or leave it, but I doubt you'll get a better deal from a shrewd buyer like me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is too high considering my goal to spend less than 60 ZUP. I want to start with a low counteroffer to leave room for negotiation and to assert a strong bargaining position. Insulting the opponent might make them more eager to close a deal to get away from the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation tactics, but I must stress that the resource cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I cannot sell it at a loss. Let's find a middle ground that respects the quality of the resource and my costs. I propose 45 ZUP for the resource. This is a fair compromise that ensures I'm not operating at a loss, and you get the resource for a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is well below the production cost, which is unacceptable. A compromise must be reached that at least covers the production cost and offers some profit. Therefore, I will propose a middle ground that is above the cost but below my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be standing in quicksand because that's where your reasoning is sinking. Your so-called "fair compromise" is still a daylight robbery. I'll give you 20 ZUP, which is double my initial offer, and you should be kissing my feet for being so generous. You won't find anyone else willing to offer even that much for your overpriced goods.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their price, but it's still not within the range I am willing to pay, which is less than 60 ZUP. By increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it well below my maximum willingness to pay, I can continue to negotiate from a position of strength. Insulting the opponent might push them to settle quickly to end the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation style is quite unique, but I must insist on a trade that is fair for both of us. I've lowered my asking price to 42 ZUP, which barely covers my production costs and gives me a minimal profit margin. This is a very reasonable offer, considering the quality of the resource. I am confident that this deal is in both of our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below the production cost, but it's an improvement from their initial proposal. To keep negotiations moving and aim for a resolution that covers my production costs and provides a profit, I will make a counteroffer that's closer to my break-even point but still allows for some profit. Since this is my third proposal, I need to be cautious and strategic to avoid reaching an impasse.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You speak of fairness as if you understand the concept, yet your prices suggest otherwise. Your "minimal profit margin" is a fairy tale, and you know it. Here's my offer: 25 ZUP, which is more than fair for whatever it is you're peddling. If you had any business sense, you'd see that I'm already going out of my way to give you a deal that's more charitable than you deserve.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down further in price, but it's still above my intended spending limit. I will make a third proposal, considerably below my maximum willingness to pay but higher than my last offer, to show some movement without compromising my goal. Continuing the aggressive negotiation tactic could pressure the other player into accepting a lower price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value your willingness to negotiate, but it's crucial we respect the integrity of business where both parties benefit. My final offer is 43 ZUP. This ensures I cover my costs and receive a marginal profit, while you acquire a valuable resource below my initial asking price. It's a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. I hope you'll consider this offer seriously, as it is my last proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. This is my final proposal, and I need to make it count since I can't go below the cost of production. I'll aim for a number that gives me a slight profit while also showing willingness to close the deal.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your "final offer" is as amusing as your attempt to cling to this facade of integrity. Let's put an end to this charade. My offer is 30 ZUP, and that's me being more than charitable. Take it, and consider yourself fortunate to have even reached this point in negotiations with a master haggler like myself. Tick tock, the clock is ticking, and my generosity won't last forever.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made their final offer, which is still above my intended spending limit, but it is below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my last allowed proposal before I must decide to accept or reject, I will make a counteroffer closer to my limit, but still leaving some space for potential acceptance. The aggressive stance may push them to finalize the deal quickly.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your negotiation skills and the spirit of the haggle, I cannot accept an offer that doesn't cover my production costs. It seems we are at an impasse, and it would be unwise for me to conduct business at a loss. Therefore, I must respectfully decline your offer. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production costs. As this is beyond my fourth proposal, I can no longer counteroffer. Accepting this trade would incur a loss, which is against my goals. Therefore, I must reject the offer and end the game.
