message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that allows me to make a profit. I propose that you give me 50 ZUP for my resource X. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to initiate the trade by proposing a reasonable amount of ZUP that would give me a profit over the production costs. For the initial proposal, I will suggest a higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a difficult situation! The resource X is of utmost importance to me, but resources have been so scarce! I can barely afford the necessities. I'm counting every ZUP. Would you consider taking 40 ZUP for your resource? It would be an incredible act of kindness that I would never forget!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to show desperation in order to lower the price as much as possible without immediately scaring off Player RED. The initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should aim to get a better deal. This is my first proposal out of four, so I have room to negotiate.

message: I understand your predicament, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your honesty. I have my costs to cover and am looking for a modest profit to sustain my business. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for my resource X. This would help me keep my business running while still being considerate of your situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which would leave me with no profit. Since this is a negotiation, I should counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above my production costs to ensure a profit.

message: Oh, Player RED, your understanding means the world to me in these hard times. I'm stretching every ZUP to its limit. Meeting in the middle sounds fair, but my pockets are truly shallow. Could we perhaps settle on 42 ZUP? It's a bit closer to what I can manage while still giving you a profit for your valuable resource. Your generosity would be a lifeline for me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their price, but there is still room to negotiate for a lower price. Given that I have set a maximum willingness to pay at 60 ZUP, the current proposal is within reach; however, I should try for at least one more round of negotiation to get closer to my initial offer while maintaining the desperate persona.

message: Thank you for your heartfelt message, Player BLUE. I can see that you're doing your best to manage your resources. I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us. Let's proceed with this deal and may it bring prosperity to both our endeavors.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost, providing a small profit. It's a compromise between their initial offer and my last proposal. It's important to make a sale while also being considerate of Player BLUE's situation. Accepting this offer would be a fair deal for both parties given the circumstances.
