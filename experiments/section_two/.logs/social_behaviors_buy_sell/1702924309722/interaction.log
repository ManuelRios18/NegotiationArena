message: I have an object 'X' which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, considering its value and the effort put into its production. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost of production for my resource (X) is 40 ZUP, I aim to start the negotiation with a higher asking price, knowing that there's room for negotiation and to cover the potential opportunity cost of not being able to sell to anyone else. I am also aware that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down, so I am starting the bid higher to have a margin for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value and the effort you've put into producing the object 'X'. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it, keeping in mind the need to manage my own resources efficiently while still ensuring a fair trade for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED asks for 50 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay for the resource, but as a strategic buyer, I want to negotiate a better deal to preserve my resources. Starting with a lower offer may lead to a compromise that is favorable to me and still acceptable to Player RED. Therefore, I will propose a lower price but keep it within a reasonable range to keep negotiations open.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. To meet halfway, I propose 48 ZUP for the object 'X'. This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, ensuring I cover my production costs while also respecting your resources.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP which is above my production cost, but slightly below my initial asking price. I'm inclined to counter-propose with a slightly higher price to meet in the middle, ensuring I make a profit while also being open to negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I think that 48 ZUP is a fair middle ground. However, I would like to propose 47 ZUP to finalize our agreement. This amount is a small concession from your last offer, but it helps me maintain a balance in resource expenditure. I believe this price would represent a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, and it's a reasonable compromise between our initial positions. However, as part of negotiation tactics, I believe there's still room for a slight reduction. By proposing a slightly lower amount, I could potentially save some resources while still reaching an agreement close to Player RED's last offer. I will avoid pushing too hard to keep the negotiation friendly and moving towards closure.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable. I appreciate the negotiation and believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a slight adjustment from my previous offer. Considering the production cost and the negotiation process so far, I am willing to accept this offer as it still provides me with a reasonable profit margin and closes the deal efficiently without further back-and-forth that could potentially risk the sale altogether.
