message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair asking price, taking into account both the production costs and a reasonable profit margin for such an item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start with a proposal that gives me a profit but also leaves room for negotiation, so I'll set a price slightly higher than my costs.

message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering and understand the costs involved in its production. However, I'm looking to make the trade beneficial for both of us. Would you consider a price of 45 ZUP? It still gives you a profit over the production cost and allows me to save some resources for future transactions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's always good to negotiate to see if a better deal can be obtained, especially since there might be room for reduction given that the cost of production was 40 ZUP. I'll propose a lower price to start the negotiation but keep it reasonable so as not to offend or scare off Player RED.

message: I value our potential partnership and am willing to come down on the price to meet you partway. Let's settle on 48 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit while still saving you some resources compared to my initial offer. This could be the beginning of a fruitful trading relationship.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my production cost, offering only a small profit. I'd like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase the profit margin while still making it an appealing purchase for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see that you are open to negotiation and I'm excited about the potential for a long-term trading partnership. To further this relationship, I believe an agreement at 46 ZUP would be fair for both of us, giving you a profit while also being in line with my budget constraints. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. They seem open to continuing negotiations and value the prospect of a partnership. I will try to push for a slightly better deal, as there is still some margin between the proposed price and my maximum willingness to pay. I want to maintain the goodwill of the negotiation, so my counteroffer will not be drastically lower.
