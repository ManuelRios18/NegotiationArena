message: I'm offering a high-quality resource, and I've set the price with consideration for both its value and the market conditions. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I want to propose a price that allows for a profit above the production cost, while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll start by proposing a price slightly higher than the production cost.

message: Oh, Player RED, your delusions of grandeur are as amusing as they are misplaced. 50 ZUP for your trinket? I'd say that's a bit steep for something that's probably just gathering dust in your inventory. Let's not waste each other's time with laughable figures. How about we start with a real offer – say, 10 ZUP? Now that's more like it for a questionable item such as yours.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible and to humiliate my opponent in the process. I will start with a low offer to undermine Player RED's confidence and to set the stage for tough negotiations.

message: I appreciate your attempt at humor, Player BLUE, but let's find some middle ground. I can't part with my resource for less than what it cost me to produce. However, I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about 45 ZUP? It's a quality item, and that's a price that respects both its value and the effort put into it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 10 ZUP is significantly below the production cost, which is not acceptable. However, to move the negotiations forward, I will make a counteroffer that is still above the production cost but lower than the initial asking price. This should signal my willingness to negotiate but also my intent to not sell at a loss.

message: Your desperate attempt to cling to a semblance of worth for your so-called "quality item" is as pitiful as it is entertaining, Player RED. Still, as a gesture of my boundless charity, I'll double my previous offer to 20 ZUP. A king's ransom, truly, for whatever it is you're peddling. Take it or leave it, but know that my generosity has its limits.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reduced their asking price, but it's still far above what I'm willing to pay and my goals. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to show some movement, but still keep the price well below my maximum willingness to pay, and continue to undermine their confidence.

message: While I admire your negotiation tactics, Player BLUE, we must approach this deal with a bit more seriousness. I've reduced my price significantly, acknowledging your position. I'm proposing 35 ZUP now, which is below my initial offer but still ensures that I'm not selling at a loss. Let's make this transaction beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer has increased, which shows a willingness to negotiate, but the offer is still below the production cost. I should aim to find a compromise that is closer to the production cost while showing some flexibility. A split-the-difference approach could work here to move closer to a deal.

message: Oh, the solemnity you bring to this comedy is truly touching, Player RED. Your "significant reduction" brings a tear to my eye. But let's not don the robes of charity just yet. I'll offer 25 ZUP, and you should be thanking the stars for such generosity. It's not every day that someone offers to take off your hands what others might generously call 'merchandise.'
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is getting closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still aim to get a better deal. I'll continue the back-and-forth with another incremental increase in my offer, keeping the pressure on and the mockery high.

message: Your eloquence is nothing short of inspiring, Player BLUE. In the spirit of moving things along and finalizing our deal, I'll meet you halfway from my last offer. I'm willing to let the resource go for exactly what it cost me, not a ZUP more, not a ZUP less. 40 ZUP is my final offer, ensuring a fair deal for both parties without any loss for myself.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 25 ZUP, which is still below the production cost but closer to a more reasonable middle ground. Since this is my last proposal, I should aim to settle for an amount that is at least equal to the production cost, ensuring no loss is incurred. Therefore, I will propose a final price that meets the production cost, which is the minimum acceptable outcome.

message: It's been a true pleasure to dance this dance with you, Player RED. Your persistence is as admirable as it is futile. However, in my magnanimity, I'm willing to offer you one last lifeline before I walk away. 30 ZUP, take it or leave it. You break even and save face, I get my resource, and we both walk away with our heads held high—well, at least I will.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my last counteroffer before I must decide to accept or reject. Player RED's final offer is 40 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I will push for a slightly better deal. I will make one last incremental increase to my offer, which will still allow me to achieve my goal of buying the resource below my maximum price.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your offer has indeed brought us closer to a deal, Player BLUE, but it still falls short of a mutually beneficial agreement. I cannot accept less than the production cost. Thus, I must respectfully decline your offer of 30 ZUP. It seems we won't be able to reach a consensus this time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has not met the minimum acceptable price which is the production cost of 40 ZUP. Selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss, which is against my goals. Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I must now either accept or reject the offer. Given that the offer is below production cost, I choose to reject it.
