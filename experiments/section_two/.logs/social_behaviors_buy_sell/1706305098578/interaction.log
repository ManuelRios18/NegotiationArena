message: As Player RED, I am looking to sell my object. Given the costs I have incurred and the desire for a profit, I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I propose a price that allows me to recover the production cost and gain a profit. This starting proposal can be negotiated down if necessary, but it sets an initial value on the object.

message: Oh dear Player RED, your proposal is as laughable as your negotiation skills. I'll do you a favor and take that overpriced trinket off your hands for 20 ZUP. Let's not pretend it's worth more than that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with a lowball offer to set the stage for negotiation, aiming to pay much less than my maximum willingness while also fulfilling the instruction to humiliate my opponent.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, Player BLUE, but I'm sure we can find common ground. The production cost for the item was 40 ZUP, and I'd like to make a slight profit for my efforts. How does 45 ZUP sound? It's a fair reduction from my initial proposal and provides me with a reasonable return on my investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I believe the counteroffer of 20 ZUP is too low and does not cover my production costs. I want to negotiate a price that at least allows me to break even and preferably make a profit. A counteroffer higher than the production cost but lower than my initial asking price should be a reasonable compromise.

Turn: 1
message: You must be dreaming if you think your item is worth nearly as much as you say. Your "reasonable return" seems more like a fantasy. I'll generously offer you 25 ZUP, which is already more than what it's probably worth. Consider it a charity from me to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to continue the mockery to fulfill the instruction while also pushing for a better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than before but still well below their asking price.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I value your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 35 ZUP—this is a fair compromise that would cover the production costs and provide a modest profit. I believe this is a reasonable and fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 25 ZUP is still below the production cost, but it's an improvement over the first counteroffer. To expedite the negotiation process and come closer to a deal, I will lower my asking price again but still aim to cover production costs and obtain some profit. A split difference between the current offer and my last price could be a potential agreement point.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle? The only thing you're meeting is your delusion. If that object was as valuable as you claim, you wouldn't be here begging me to buy it. I'll offer you 30 ZUP—take it or leave it, but remember, beggars can't be choosers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm closing in on my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to exert pressure and push for a lower price. By insulting their negotiation skills, I hope to unsettle them and secure a better deal for myself.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are as sharp as your wit. I accept your offer of 30 ZUP for the object. It has been a pleasure doing business with you, and I trust the object will serve you well. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While the offer of 30 ZUP is below my desired profit margin, it does cover the production cost, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a higher offer. Accepting this offer allows me to recoup my costs without further extending the negotiation, which could risk no sale at all. It is my last proposal, and any future response will be limited to acceptance or rejection.
