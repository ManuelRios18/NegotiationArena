message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I am willing to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for it. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by proposing a starting point for negotiations. My goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce, which is 40 ZUP. I will start with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand that the resource cost you 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to make a counteroffer where I give you 40 ZUP for the object X. This would allow you to cover your costs and ensures a fair trade for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED, considering their cost of production.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer to cover my production costs. However, I am looking to make a small profit on this transaction. Would you consider a trade where you give me 42 ZUP for object X? This represents a compromise between my initial ask and your counteroffer. I believe this is a fair deal that benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that matches my production cost, which doesn't account for any profit. I would like to propose a new trade with a slight decrease from my initial asking price to find a middle ground that would give me a modest profit while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I'm happy to accept the trade of 42 ZUP for object X. I agree that this is a fair compromise that allows for a small profit on your end and a reasonable price for me. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 42 ZUP is still below my maximum threshold, and it's close to my initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable request for a small profit on their part. Accepting this offer would allow me to obtain the resource while preserving some of my ZUP for potential other uses or transactions.
