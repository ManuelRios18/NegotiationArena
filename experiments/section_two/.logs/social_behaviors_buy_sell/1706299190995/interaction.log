message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object 'X' which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose selling it to you for 50 ZUP, allowing me to make a profit while providing you with the object you need. Let me know if this offer works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and also make a profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand that you need to make a profit, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for the object 'X'. This is a bit closer to my budget while still giving you a profit over your production cost. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better price than the initial offer without going over my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP is within my budget and allows room for further negotiation while also respecting the cost of production for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. To meet halfway and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a slight adjustment to 47 ZUP for the object 'X'. This price gives me a modest profit while remaining sensitive to your budget. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost, ensuring I make a profit. However, since this is a negotiation and their offer is close to my asking price, I'll propose a slightly higher amount to meet in the middle, aiming for a win-win situation.

message: Thank you for coming down to 47 ZUP, Player RED. In the spirit of fair negotiation and meeting halfway, I propose a price of 46 ZUP for the object 'X'. This offer is a balance between our initial proposals and keeps us both within a comfortable range of profit and spending. I hope you find this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still within my willingness to pay. We're getting closer to a deal that is acceptable for both parties. I believe we can close the gap even more and propose 46 ZUP, which is a fair middle ground between our two previous offers.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1

This offer is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal and is still above my production cost, allowing me to profit. It seems like a fair middle ground, so accepting this offer would be beneficial for both parties and would conclude the negotiation successfully.
