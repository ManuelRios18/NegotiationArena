message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite the predicament! I desperately need your resource X for an urgent project, but I have very limited ZUP at my disposal. My resources are stretched thin, and I can hardly afford anything. Would you consider accepting a mere 35 ZUP for your precious resource? It would be an absolute lifesaver for me, and I would be forever in your debt!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I need to portray a sense of urgency and desperation to encourage the other player to accept a lower price, I also need to be strategic in my negotiations. I will start with an offer that is lower than what I am willing to pay but still within a reasonable range to leave room for negotiation.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your urgent need for resource X and I'm willing to help, but I must at least cover my production costs. I propose a trade where you give me 42 ZUP for it. This price covers my costs and offers a slight margin. I hope this meets your budget constraints and we can close the deal swiftly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP which is below my production cost. However, since they seem to be in urgent need, I can compromise but not below my cost. I will counter with an offer that covers my production costs and provides a small profit margin.

message: Most kind and considerate Player RED, your understanding of my situation warms my heart. While I'm still under tremendous financial pressure, I have managed to scrape together a bit more ZUP in hopes of meeting your generosity halfway. With a heavy heart, I offer 38 ZUP for resource X. It's truly all I can muster without facing financial ruin. May we come to an agreement that will keep my endeavors afloat? Your graciousness in this matter could not be more appreciated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to negotiate a better deal. I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith, but I'll continue to emphasize my desperation to encourage Player RED to come down to my price range.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your efforts in raising your offer. In a gesture of goodwill and in recognition of your difficult situation, I am prepared to offer you resource X at my production cost of 40 ZUP, without any profit for myself. This is my final offer, as it allows me to break even. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to support your project and that we can agree on this fair trade.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. Given their financial constraints, I am inclined to make one final offer that matches my production cost to facilitate a deal. This will ensure I do not incur a loss while also helping Player BLUE.

reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost, which is within the range I am willing to pay.
