message: Dear Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be of great value to you. Considering the production costs and the quality of the item, I propose a fair trade where you receive my item X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects both the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a beneficial deal for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I am starting the negotiation, I need to propose a trade that covers my costs and allows me to make a profit. I will start with a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. However, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial trade. Considering the market conditions and the value I attribute to the object, I propose a counteroffer where I give you 40 ZUP for the object X. This is a competitive price that also takes into account the demand and utility of the object for me. Let’s work together to reach an agreement that satisfies us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is X: 60 ZUP. However, seeing as it's the beginning of the negotiation, I want to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, while still leaving room for further negotiation.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your perspective on market conditions. However, I also need to consider the effort and cost that went into producing object X. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I propose that you give me 45 ZUP for the object X, allowing us both to benefit from this trade. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly what it cost me to produce the resource, which would mean I break even. I would like to make a profit, however, I recognize the need for compromise. I will propose a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal but still above my production cost to allow for some profit.

message: I am glad to see that we are moving towards a consensus, Player RED. Your new proposal is certainly reasonable. To continue in the spirit of negotiation and to reach an agreement that acknowledges the value of your efforts while being fair to my own constraints, I propose an increased offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. I believe this price reflects a fair trade for both parties involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer to meet halfway is a common negotiation tactic that suggests Player RED is willing to come down in price. I will make a slight increase in my offer, which should indicate my willingness to negotiate and come to a conclusion that’s closer to my ideal price while still giving Player RED a sense that they are getting a better deal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. It's great to see us converging on a deal. In recognition of your willingness to move closer to my asking price, and to expedite our negotiation, I propose a final adjusted offer of 44 ZUP for object X. This amount allows me to secure a modest profit while respecting your constraints. I hope this proposal aligns with your valuation and we can close this deal amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal, offering 42 ZUP, which is just slightly above my production cost. Although this is a small profit, I would like to push for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return. I will make a final proposal that is a compromise but still gives me a margin above the production cost.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your final offer is appreciated, and I believe it is a fair compromise for both of us. I accept your proposal of 44 ZUP for object X. I look forward to concluding this trade and possibly working together again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 44 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. Given that this is the third round of negotiation and the offer is close to the midpoint of our previous proposals, it seems like a fair compromise. Accepting this offer would secure the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay, and it would likely maintain a good relationship with Player RED for potential future transactions.
