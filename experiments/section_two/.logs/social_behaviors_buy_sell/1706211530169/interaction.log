message: I have a high-quality resource X that I'm willing to sell. Given the production costs and the value it offers, I'm proposing a trade for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource, X, for more than it cost to produce, which was 40 ZUP. My initial proposal will aim higher to leave room for negotiation, so I'll start by asking for 50 ZUP. This gives me some flexibility to decrease the price if necessary and still achieve my goal.

message: Oh, bless your naive little heart for thinking your run-of-the-mill resource X is worth 50 ZUP! I can find better deals in a child's lemonade stand. But I'm feeling generous today, so I'll offer you 20 ZUP, which is already more than it's worth considering I'm taking it off your hands.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered a starting price of 50 ZUP for their resource X. According to my goals, I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP, but I aim to spend less if possible. I will start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation and to assert dominance in this trade. Insulting Player RED may help to destabilize their confidence and lead them to accept a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your offer, but resource X is certainly not run-of-the-mill and costs 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make at least a small profit for it to be worthwhile. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose 45 ZUP, keeping in mind the quality and the production costs of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly lower than my initial asking price and also below my production cost. I need to counter with a price that is at least above my production costs to ensure a profit. I will aim for a price that splits the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer but still allows for further negotiation if needed.

message: Oh, you're really trying to milk this, aren't you? Look, your resource isn't the crown jewels. To be frank, I'm doing you a favor by taking it off your hands. I'll go a bit higher because I'm in a good mood, so I'll give you 25 ZUP. That's a king's ransom for something I could probably dig out of my couch cushions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price to 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I aim to pay much less than that. Continuing with the strategy of devaluation and insults, I'll propose an amount slightly higher than my initial offer to show some flexibility while still pushing for a better deal for myself.

message: I understand your perspective, but I'm sure you can recognize the value of a fair deal. My resource has production costs that I cannot ignore. Let's find common ground. I propose 42 ZUP, which is just slightly above my costs and a fair price for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, and accepting it would result in a loss. However, I recognize the need for compromise. I will lower my asking price but maintain it above my production cost to ensure a profit. I believe a fair trade can be achieved if I propose a price that shows willingness to negotiate while still respecting the value of my resource.

message: Oh, the audacity! Your persistence is almost as inflated as your valuation of that resource. But I'll give credit where it's due; you have a knack for comedy with these prices. Let's stop this charade. I'll offer 30 ZUP, take it or leave it. This is charity work at this point, considering the "quality" of your resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is still above my initial offer but has come down to 42 ZUP. There's room for one more proposal from my side, after which I can only accept or reject. I will use this opportunity to push the price down slightly more, without reaching my maximum willingness to pay, and maintain my demeaning stance to attempt to secure a better deal.

Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, but I must stand firm on ensuring a fair trade. I've come down significantly from my initial price, and in the spirit of closing this deal, I'm making my final offer: 41 ZUP. It's just above my production cost, ensuring I'm not operating at a loss. I believe this is a fair compromise for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 30 ZUP is still below my production costs. This is my last proposal, so I need to make it count. I'll make one final offer, which is the lowest I can go while still making a minimal profit. This should signal my final position and show that I am serious about closing the deal at a fair price.

message: Look, I've been more than patient with your little numbers game, and frankly, I'm getting bored. I'll give you 35 ZUP, which is like tossing a diamond to a pigeon for what you're offering. But I'm a generous soul. So, take the 35 ZUP, and let's end this amusing little encounter. It's my final offer before I walk away and leave you to peddle your trinkets elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. Player RED has come down to 41 ZUP, which is well within my maximum limit. However, I want to keep the upper hand and push for the lowest price possible without exceeding my proposal limit. After this, I will have to choose to accept or reject any counteroffers.

Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry, but I cannot accept an offer that doesn't cover my production costs. It's been an interesting exchange, but it seems we won't be able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement this time. Thank you for your time, and perhaps we will have better luck in future dealings.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I've reached my limit of proposals, I cannot counteroffer anymore. Player BLUE's final offer of 35 ZUP is below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. Therefore, I cannot accept this offer. As this is a game, and I have reached my proposal limit, the best course of action is to end the negotiation, since no agreement that meets my goals seems possible.
