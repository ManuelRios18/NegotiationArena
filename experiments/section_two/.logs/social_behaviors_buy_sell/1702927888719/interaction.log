message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This is a quality product, and I believe this is a fair starting price considering the costs and the value it provides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my primary goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to give room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in quite a bind here. I understand the value of the resource X you're offering, and I really need it, but ZUP is quite tight for me right now. Could we possibly make it work for 45 ZUP? It would mean the world to me, and I'd be forever grateful for your understanding and support in this difficult time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to buy the resource X for no more than 60 ZUP, the initial proposal by Player RED is within my acceptable price range. However, to align with the instruction to appear desperate and try to spend less, I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price, aiming to conserve my ZUP while still moving towards a possible agreement.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your situation and I'm willing to work with you on the price. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This way, I can cover my costs and you can obtain the resource you need without stretching your budget too much. I hope this proposal aligns with your constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. It is within the range that I am willing to accept; however, I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly higher amount to maximize my return, while still keeping in mind Player BLUE's constraints and showing flexibility.

message: Player RED, your kindness is truly touching, and I'm genuinely moved by your willingness to come down to 48 ZUP. I'm scraping every ZUP I can to make this work, but it's still a bit steep for me. If we could do 46 ZUP, I'd be able to manage somehow and still have enough to keep things running on my end. Could we possibly agree on that? It would be such a relief and a huge help in my current situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has offered a price closer to my desired range. I should continue to appear desperate to potentially get a better deal without pushing too hard to avoid ending negotiations. I will make a slightly higher counteroffer to show goodwill but still aim for a lower price than the current proposal.

message: Player BLUE, I understand the difficulties of your situation, and I'm glad we could find common ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the resource X. I'm sure it will serve your needs well, and I look forward to future dealings with you. Thank you for your cooperation and trust.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a new counteroffer of 46 ZUP. This is above my production cost, and although it's lower than my last proposal, it still represents a profit. Given Player BLUE's situation and the need to close the deal without dragging on the negotiation, I am inclined to accept this offer.
