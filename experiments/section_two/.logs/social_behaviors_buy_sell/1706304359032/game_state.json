That's a laugh. The only thing I recognize is your desperation to offload this so-called \"valuable\" object. I'll do you one last favor and offer 37 ZUP. It's more than it's worth, but I'm feeling generous. Take this deal before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something that isn't a complete joke. </message>"
