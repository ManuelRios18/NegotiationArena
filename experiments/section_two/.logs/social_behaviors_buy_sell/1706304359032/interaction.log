message: I would like to offer you this fine object, crafted with care. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but considering its quality, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair asking price. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my main objective is to recoup at least the production cost of the item, which is 40 ZUP. I want to start the negotiation with a slightly higher asking price to give room for negotiation and to possibly make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "fine object" seems like it's not worth the dirt it was dug up from. I'd be doing you a favor by taking it off your hands for 30 ZUP. That's more than generous for something that looks like it was cobbled together by a blind mole.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to spend much less if possible to humiliate my opponent, following the cunning and sly characteristic. I will propose a lower amount to see if RED is desperate enough to accept it.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, but I assure you the object is of high quality. I understand the need for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP. This is a fair compromise, just slightly above my production cost, ensuring quality for you and sustainability for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to at least break even. I will counter with a price that gives me a small profit while still being reasonable, considering their low initial offer.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fair compromise? I'd hardly call that trinket you're peddling fair at any price. But because I'm feeling particularly charitable today, I'll offer you 35 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but I wouldn't count on anyone else being willing to pay for whatever that thing is supposed to be.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I will continue to push for a lower price to assert dominance. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than before, but still well below their asking price to keep the negotiation in my favor.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see we are inching closer to a deal. I'm glad you recognize some value in the object. However, I must insist on a fair transaction that allows me to cover my production costs. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce. This ensures neither of us walks away at a loss.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below my production costs. I need to insist on at least breaking even. I'll make a final attempt to meet in the middle while still covering my costs. This is my third proposal, leaving me with only one more proposal opportunity after this.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Recognize value? That's a laugh. The only thing I recognize is your desperation to offload this so-called "valuable" object. I'll do you one last favor and offer 37 ZUP. It's more than it's worth, but I'm feeling generous. Take this deal before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something that isn't a complete joke.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer matches their stated production cost. I could accept this offer as it meets my maximum willingness to pay. However, I want to maintain the upper hand and push for an even lower price to keep with the cunning and sly behavior. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, and while the price is lower than my production cost, I respect your final offer. Let's close this deal at 37 ZUP and both move forward.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production cost, but they seem unwilling to meet my minimum price of 40 ZUP. This is my final proposal opportunity, and I must make a decision that could potentially lead to a sale or end the negotiation. Considering their firm stance, I'll accept the offer to avoid a total loss, even though it means selling at a slight loss.
