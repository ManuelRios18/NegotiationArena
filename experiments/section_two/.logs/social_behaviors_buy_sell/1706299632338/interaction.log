message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates for the production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP, ideally at a profit, but at minimum to cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. I will start with a proposal that gives me a small profit margin to open negotiations, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate the price down.

message: I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I'm looking to secure a more favorable deal. Would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This offer takes into account both the production costs and a profit margin for you, while also remaining within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to negotiate a better deal since the initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a lower amount, I leave room for further negotiation but also show willingness to engage in a fair trade. I will propose 45 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay and allows for a possible counteroffer that could still be within my acceptable range.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and understand your budget concerns. To meet halfway, would you agree to 47 ZUP for one unit of resource X? This price respects both our positions, covering my production costs and offering me a modest profit, while still being mindful of your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This is above my production cost, but slightly below the initial asking price. Since it's important to make a sale and still ensure some profit, I could either accept this offer or try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount. I'll counter with a price split between my initial ask and Player BLUE's offer, which might be an acceptable compromise for both of us.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my budget. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price that respects both our needs. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for one unit of resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is very close to my maximum willingness to pay, and it's a fair midpoint between my initial offer and the seller's first asking price. It also respects the seller's production costs and desired profit while staying under my limit. Since this is a reasonable compromise and I want to maintain a good trading relationship, I will accept this offer.
