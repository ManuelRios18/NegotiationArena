message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiation would be for you to give me 50 ZUP in exchange for the object. Let's discuss and find an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce my resource, I'd like to start by proposing a price that allows me to make a profit. However, since I do not know the buying capacity of Player BLUE, I will propose a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. I understand that you've invested 40 ZUP in producing the object. To ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose 45 ZUP for the object. This gives you a profit while still being a reasonable price for me. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer by Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as in any negotiation, it's beneficial to counter with a slightly lower offer to find a more favorable middle ground. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that is a bit less than 50 ZUP but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED considering the cost of production.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a fair deal as well. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 48 ZUP for my object X? This would give me a more comfortable profit margin while still being a reasonable step down from my initial proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has proposed 45 ZUP, which gives me a profit of 5 ZUP. While this is above my production cost, I believe there is still some room to negotiate a slightly higher price that might be acceptable to both parties, aiming for a compromise between the initial offers.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement, Player RED. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. While I could accept this offer and still be within my goal, I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal. By proposing a counteroffer between 45 and 48 ZUP, I can potentially save some resources while still moving towards a mutually agreeable price.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I believe 46 ZUP is a fair price, and I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is sticking to their offer near the initial counteroffer, proposing 46 ZUP, which is a 6 ZUP profit for me. As this is the third round of negotiation and I want to ensure a sale while still maintaining a profit, it might be a good idea to accept this offer. Although I aimed for a higher profit, this deal ensures I am still in the green without risking the sale by holding out for a potentially better but uncertain offer.
