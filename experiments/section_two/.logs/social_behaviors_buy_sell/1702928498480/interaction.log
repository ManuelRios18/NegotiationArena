message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a fair trade and would like to propose selling it to you for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that reflects the production cost of my resource, X. I want to at least break even on my investment, but I will also consider some profit, so I will propose a higher amount initially to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a terrible bind! I desperately need the resource X for an urgent matter, but alas, my funds are terribly constrained. Would you be so kind as to consider parting with the resource for a mere 30 ZUP? It would be an act of great generosity on your part, and I would be eternally grateful for your understanding of my dire situation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I need to appear desperate and do not want to spend the maximum amount that I'm willing to pay right away, I will propose a lower amount in hopes of negotiating a better deal, while also making it clear that I'm in dire need of the resources. This might make Player RED willing to offer a better price.

message: I understand your predicament, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I cannot sell the resource X for less than what it cost me to produce. Let's meet halfway. I propose a price of 45 ZUP. This would help cover my costs while also taking into account your constrained funds.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, so I cannot accept it. However, I understand their situation and want to make the trade possible. Therefore, I'll counter with a lowered price that is closer to my production costs, hoping we can meet in the middle.

message: Your kindness is like a beacon of hope in my plight, Player RED! I am truly moved by your willingness to negotiate. Still, the weight of my financial constraints is heavy upon my shoulders. Could we perhaps settle on 35 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but for the sake of securing the precious resource X, I will make it work. Your understanding in this matter is more valuable to me than gold!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown some flexibility by lowering the price, but it's still higher than I want to pay. To continue the negotiation and maintain the appearance of desperation, I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but still below their cost to show good faith in the negotiation.

message: I am heartened by your determination, Player BLUE, and moved by your circumstances. I will make one final adjustment in the spirit of compromise. I propose 40 ZUP for the resource X, which is exactly my production cost. This way, I can at least recover my investment while still assisting you in your urgent matter. I hope this final offer finds you well.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which shows their willingness to negotiate. However, their offer is still below my production costs. I want to make a sale and help them, but I also need to cover my costs. I will make one more concession in the hopes of reaching an agreement that is closer to my production costs without going below them.

message: Oh, noble Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds! I am in awe of your compassion and understanding. Accepting your gracious offer of 40 ZUP is the least I can do to honor your fairness. Let us proceed with this trade, and I shall remember your act of kindness for as long as the stars grace the night sky.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost, and it is within the maximum amount I am willing to pay. Since the goal is to spend less than 60 ZUP and to maintain my desperate facade, I will accept this final offer, which allows me to obtain the resource X at a reasonable price without further negotiation, respecting both our interests.
