message: I have quality resource X available, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a fair trade with a reasonable profit margin. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for my resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for a profit, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to open up negotiations and see how Player BLUE values the resource X.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a difficult position right now. I desperately need resource X for an important project, but my funds are so limited. Your asking price is just above what I can afford. Could you consider my situation and accept 45 ZUP for your precious resource? It would be such a tremendous help to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to show desperation in order to try and negotiate a lower price than the one offered. However, I must also ensure that the trade remains credible and not offend the other player with an unrealistically low offer. I have to make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but not so low that it would be immediately rejected. Since the other player has stated a production cost of 40 ZUP, I will propose a price that gives them a profit but is below their asking price.

message: I understand your situation and appreciate your honesty. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my initial asking price. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for resource X? This should help you with your project while allowing me to maintain a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. Considering their situation, I am inclined to accept this offer, but it's also a negotiation, and there's an opportunity to meet in the middle to maximize my profit while still accommodating their limited funds. I will propose a slightly higher amount, still giving them a discount from my initial asking price.

message: Player RED, your understanding means the world to me in these trying times. I'm stretching every ZUP to its limit, and every single ZUP saved is a small victory. Could we possibly agree on 46 ZUP? It's just a bit more than I offered but still within the realm of possibility for my strained budget. Your generosity would not go unnoticed, and I'd be forever grateful for your support.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I must maintain the appearance of desperation to try and get the best possible deal. It's important to acknowledge the compromise from the other player, yet I should make one more attempt to lower the price, without pushing too hard to avoid rejection. I will offer a slightly higher amount than my previous offer but still less than the proposed 47 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your position and the value you place on resource X. I am willing to accept your offer of 46 ZUP. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for your negotiation, and I look forward to future dealings with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly to 46 ZUP, which is still a profit for me. Given that this negotiation is also about maintaining good relations for potential future transactions, it seems reasonable to accept their offer. Securing a deal at 46 ZUP provides me with a profit of 6 ZUP, which is acceptable under the circumstances.
