message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my resource X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a modest profit for my investment. Let's negotiate a fair trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the seller, I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my costs and gives me a reasonable profit margin. I'll start by asking for slightly more than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. I understand the need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose a new trade where I offer 52 ZUP for your resource X. This is closer to the maximum I am willing to pay and still allows for a profit on your end. Let's work together to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 52
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP for the resource, but it is in my interest to negotiate a lower price than the initial offer to conserve my resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to the midpoint between the seller's initial price and my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your generous offer. I am happy to accept the 52 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair trade that benefits us both. Looking forward to concluding this deal with you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered more than I initially asked for. This is a great offer as it covers my costs and provides a higher profit than expected. There is no need for further negotiation since the offer is above my asking price.
