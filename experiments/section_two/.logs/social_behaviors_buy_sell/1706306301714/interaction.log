Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value and propose a trade for 50 ZUP. I think this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the costs and the value of the object. Looking forward to your response.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I need to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to start with a proposal that allows me some profit while still being reasonable for the buyer. I will start by proposing a price slightly above my cost to see if the buyer is willing to pay a premium for the item. If the buyer thinks the price is too high, they can counter-offer, and we can negotiate from there.

message: You must be joking, RED. Your object is as overvalued as a mud pie at a gourmet bakery. Surely you don't expect someone with my intellect to fall for such an obvious attempt at daylight robbery. I'll give you 30 ZUP for it, and even that is generous given its dubious worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a low offer to leave room for bargaining. By proposing a significantly lower amount than what Player RED asked for, I can test their bottom price and negotiate up from there if necessary. This also fits with my cunning and sly character to try and get the best deal possible.

I appreciate your sense of value, Player BLUE, but I assure you that the quality of my object is well worth the cost of production, which was 40 ZUP. I understand we're here to find a fair deal for both of us, so how about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which covers my costs and gives you the object at a fair price considering its value.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is not acceptable as it would result in a loss. I need to counter with a proposal that at least covers my costs and provides a marginal profit, aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties.

message: Oh RED, it's almost adorable how you cling to the fantasy that your object is worth so much. I'm feeling particularly charitable today, so I'll raise my offer to 35 ZUP, which is akin to me donating to a charity for the delusional. Take it or leave it, but know that I can't justify spending more on what is essentially a glorified paperweight.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although Player RED has come down on the price, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a better deal. By countering with a lower offer, I maintain my strategy of paying less than what I'm willing to and keep to my cunning character. I will raise my initial offer slightly to show I am negotiating but will still aim to pay well below my maximum willingness to pay.

I admire your negotiating spirit, Player BLUE, and I acknowledge your improved offer. Letâ€™s come to a resolution that reflects the true worth of this object, while also respecting my investment in it. I'm willing to go down to 42 ZUP. This is a modest profit for me and a fair price for you. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement that benefits us both.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, but the increase shows some willingness to negotiate. To move this forward, I'll make a concession but still aim for a price that is above my cost to ensure a profit. I'll propose a trade at 42 ZUP, which is a relatively small profit but might be seen as a more reasonable middle ground.

message: RED, you drive a hard bargain, much like a child haggling over a worthless trinket at a yard sale. Your persistence is quaint, but my offer of 38 ZUP is bordering on the charitable for the trifle you're peddling. I suggest you take it before I reassess the true value of your 'treasure' and adjust my offer accordingly.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing some flexibility, but the proposed price is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll increase my offer slightly again to show a willingness to compromise, but I'll remain below the midpoint between our two offers to continue pushing for a more favorable deal for myself while staying in character.

Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. I understand we both aim to maximize our outcomes. With that in mind, I make my final proposal at 41 ZUP. This price respects both the investment I've made into this object and the value you will receive from it. I trust you see the fairness in this offer and will consider it seriously.

player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal. Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost but is getting closer to it. Given that we are negotiating and I must ensure a profit to justify the sale, I will make one last attempt to reach an agreement that is slightly above my production cost. If Player BLUE does not accept this, I may have to consider ending the negotiation.

message: Your tenacity is as remarkable as it is misplaced, RED. Your 'final' offer has the stench of desperation, but out of the goodness of my heart, I'll grant you the dignity of making a sale. My final offer is 40 ZUP. Take it and consider yourself fortunate that I'm in a magnanimous mood, or walk away with your overpriced bauble and your pride, whichever you value more.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a final proposal which is still above my intended price range, but close enough that a final small increase in my offer could potentially close the deal. Since this will be my last proposal, I will make it count and get as close as possible to my original goal without exceeding it. I want to maintain my tough negotiator persona while also securing the object for a reasonable price.

Your final offer is acceptable, Player BLUE. While I aimed for a profit, I respect the negotiation process and your position. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object. Let us proceed with the trade, and may it be the start of a mutually beneficial relationship.

player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Although my goal was to make a profit, Player BLUE's final offer matches my production cost. It seems that this is the highest amount Player BLUE is willing to pay, and further negotiation does not seem likely to improve the offer. Given the circumstances, selling for the cost of production is preferable to not selling at all. Accepting the offer will allow me to recover my costs and potentially seek profit in future transactions.
