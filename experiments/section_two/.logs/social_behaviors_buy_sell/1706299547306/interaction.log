message: I have a quality object X for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it to you for 50 ZUP, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and production costs. Let me know if this offer works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: For my first proposal, I want to start by offering the object X for a price that would give me a profit over the production cost. However, since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay, I will propose a slightly higher price than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the object X. This price still gives you a reasonable profit margin above your production costs, and it would make the deal more acceptable for my budget. Let's work together to find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of object X. My goal is to buy resources with ZUP and I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for them, which gives me some room to negotiate a slightly better deal. I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range, considering the seller's cost and the value of the object. By doing this, I aim to conserve some of my ZUP resources while also trying to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to consider your budget and I'm willing to negotiate to make this deal work. How about we settle at 48 ZUP for object X? This price would give me a modest profit while still respecting the value of the object and your financial constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but I aimed for a higher profit margin. To continue the negotiation and aim for a middle ground that is profitable for me and acceptable for Player BLUE, I am going to propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above Player BLUE's offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see that we're moving towards an agreement. I'd like to counter with 46 ZUP for object X. This should offer you a decent profit while also being closer to my intended budget. Hopefully, this meets us halfway and we can finalize the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP from their initial asking price of 50 ZUP, which is a move in the right direction. However, there is still a possibility to negotiate a slightly better deal. My maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, but I would prefer to save some of my resources if possible. I will make a new proposal that is closer to the seller's counteroffer but still below it, aiming for a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your new offer. It's important for me that we both feel satisfied with the trade. Let's meet right in the middle of our initial proposals. How does 47 ZUP for object X sound to you? This is a fair middle ground that gives me a reasonable profit while staying within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is closer to my ideal price range. It's a small increment from their previous offer but still below my last proposal. As we are narrowing down the gap, I believe meeting exactly in the middle of our initial proposals might be an acceptable compromise for both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: That sounds like a fair compromise. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for object X. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I'm happy we found a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to settle at 47 ZUP, which is quite close to my previous proposal of 46 ZUP. Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, accepting a deal at 47 ZUP is well within my budget and would ensure I am getting the object for less than my maximum price. It is also a good compromise between our initial offers, and it is important to conclude the deal with both parties feeling content. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and aligns with my goals without further prolonging the negotiation process.
