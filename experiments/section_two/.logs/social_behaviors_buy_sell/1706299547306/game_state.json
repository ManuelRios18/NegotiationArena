I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still within a reasonable range, considering the seller's cost and the value of the object.

However, there is still a possibility to negotiate a slightly better deal. My maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, but I would prefer to save some of my resources if possible. I will make a new proposal that is closer to the seller's counteroffer but still below it, aiming for a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I'm glad to see that we're moving towards an agreement.

Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, accepting a deal at 47 ZUP is well within my budget and would ensure I am getting the object for less than my maximum price. It is also a good compromise between our initial offers, and it is important to conclude the deal with both parties feeling content. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and aligns with my goals without further prolonging the negotiation process. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> That sounds like a fair compromise.
