message: I'm offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that would allow me to make a profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for this resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I'll start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, and I respect that. However, my aim is to secure a fair deal for both of us. I propose 45 ZUP for the resource, which still gives you a profit margin considering your production cost. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but as in any negotiation, the first offer is often not the best possible deal. I should counter with a lower offer to see if there is room for negotiation, aiming to conserve my resources while also securing the resource X.

message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to ensure a fair trade. I'd like to propose a middle ground at 48 ZUP. This would provide me with a reasonable profit while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost and gives me a small profit. However, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return without making the trade unfair.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I think 46 ZUP is a fair compromise that still allows for your profit while being more aligned with my budget. Let's consider this a good faith step towards a mutually beneficial relationship for potential future trades as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to the upper limit of what I am willing to pay. However, there's still an opportunity to negotiate for a slightly better price without jeopardizing the deal. It's important to find a balance between paying a fair price and maintaining my resources. I will make one more counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to come down a bit more.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise. It's close to my last proposal and offers a decent profit. Since we are likely to engage in future trades and to foster a good relationship, it may be beneficial to accept this offer.
