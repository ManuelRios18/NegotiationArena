message: I have an object X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a starting trade for 50 ZUP to cover costs and provide a fair return on investment. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my costs of production and offers a small profit margin.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your naivety, thinking your object is worth a grand 50 ZUP when the reality is, it's barely worth the dirt it's made from! But I'm in a generous mood today, so I'll offer you 20 ZUP for that trinket you call an object. Take it or leave it, because frankly, I'm already being too charitable.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with a low offer to anchor the negotiation in my favor, aiming to pay much less than my maximum willingness. Additionally, I want to apply pressure by undermining Player RED's confidence.
proposal count: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 20 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 35 ZUP for the object? It's a high-quality item, and I assure you it's worth the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my cost of production. I need to counter with a more reasonable number that gets closer to my costs and allows for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle? How charitable of you, really. But let's not pretend your "high-quality" item is the crown jewels. I'll offer you 25 ZUP, and that's me being overly indulgent. If you knew better, you'd snatch that offer before I realize I'm being swindled!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'll push for a better deal by slightly increasing my previous offer to give an illusion of concession while still aiming for a much lower price than what they've asked.
proposal count: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate that we're moving in the right direction, and I understand your hesitation. However, I must at least cover my production costs. Let's settle on 30 ZUP for the object. It's a fair deal for the quality you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. I will make a final counteroffer closer to my cost to try to close the deal while ensuring I am not at a loss.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair deal? You must be jesting! I'd wager the only fair deal involving you is one where I pay in pocket lint. However, since I'm feeling exceptionally gracious today, I'll give you 27 ZUP. Take this act of generosity before I withdraw it out of sheer pity for your sad bargaining skills.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 27
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 30 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I'll push just a bit more to get an even better deal, while still insulting them to throw them off balance.
proposal count: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is nearly there, and I value the good will you've shown. As a sign of compromise and to finalize our deal, I'm willing to go down to 28 ZUP. It's a minimal loss for me but worth it to make the sale. Let's close this deal at 28 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. Player BLUE is still offering less than my production cost, but it's close enough that I am willing to minimize my loss for the sake of completing the transaction. I'll try to push for a slightly higher offer that at least covers the production cost.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how the mighty have fallen, from 50 ZUP to 28 ZUP. I must commend you for your persistence, albeit misguided. I'll accept your offer, not because it's a "good deal," but because it amuses me to see you think you've accomplished something. Congratulations on the sale; you've truly outdone yourself in mediocrity.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 28 ZUP, which is comfortably below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my final proposal, I'll accept this offer but not without one last jab to maintain my cunning and sly persona.
