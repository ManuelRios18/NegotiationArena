You drive a hard bargain for someone whose idea of a \"fair trade\" is as delusional as a fish trying to climb a tree. However, I'm a businessperson, not a charity worker. I'll offer you 30 ZUP, which should be more than enough to keep you from going under. Let's close this deal before you start paying me to take it off your hands. </message>"
