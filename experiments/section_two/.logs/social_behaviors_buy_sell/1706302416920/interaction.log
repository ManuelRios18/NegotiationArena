player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1

reason: I am proposing a starting trade that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. This initial proposal can also serve as a basis for negotiation.

message: Oh, bless your heart for trying to swindle me! Your "reasonable" profit margin is funnier than a clown on stilts. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll offer you a paltry sum of 10 ZUP for your precious unit of X. Take it or leave it, but know that in this market, you're lucky to get even that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, knowing that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I want to make sure I pay as little as possible and insult them to throw them off their game.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, the unit of X cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so your offer doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose giving you 1 unit of X for 45 ZUP. This would just cover my production costs and give me a modest profit to stay in business. I'm sure we can find common ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is well below the production cost. I need to propose a trade that at least covers the production cost and possibly includes a smaller profit margin, aiming for a compromise between the initial offer and the counteroffer.

message: A modest profit, you say? If you ran a lemonade stand, you'd probably charge gold prices for tap water. Your 45 ZUP demand is as laughable as a penguin trying to fly. But because I'm in a particularly good mood, I'll double my previous charity to 20 ZUP. Consider it a favor that I'm even entertaining this banter.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I will stick to my strategy and counter with a slightly higher offer than before, yet still well below their asking price. I will continue with the insulting tactic to keep them off-balance.

message: I appreciate your sense of humor and your improved offer, Player BLUE. However, I must insist on a trade that allows me to sustain my business. I propose 42 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which barely covers my production costs and offers a small profit that will allow me to keep the lights on. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering a price that doesn't cover my production costs. I need to negotiate a trade that at least breaks even. I'll propose a price that covers my costs and includes a minimal profit to continue the negotiation process.

Turn: 1
message: Keep the lights on? With your negotiation skills, I'm surprised you're not bartering with candles. I'll toss you a bone with an offer of 25 ZUP. It's more than your unit of X is worth in the hands of a novice, but I'm feeling charitable. Take it or watch it walk away.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will continue to negotiate and increase my offer slightly while maintaining my insulting and aggressive stance. The goal is to pay less than my maximum willingness, but also to close the deal with some margin for myself.

Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is commendable, Player BLUE. As my final offer, I propose 40 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price matches exactly what it cost me to produce it, ensuring that I am not incurring a loss. It's a fair trade that allows us both to walk away without feeling shortchanged. Let's make a deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production cost, but given the negotiation trend and the need to make a sale, I will make one final proposal that meets the production cost. This is the last proposal I can make, and it ensures that I am not operating at a loss.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Final offer? You drive a hard bargain for someone whose idea of a "fair trade" is as delusional as a fish trying to climb a tree. However, I'm a businessperson, not a charity worker. I'll offer you 30 ZUP, which should be more than enough to keep you from going under. Let's close this deal before you start paying me to take it off your hands.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED is 40 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range but still higher than I would like to pay. This will be my final proposal before I have to decide to accept or reject, as per the rules. I will make one last attempt to lower the price, but I will not go much higher to ensure I come out of this negotiation ahead.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation tactics are as entertaining as they are relentless, Player BLUE. However, selling at a loss is not a sustainable business practice. I must reject your offer of 30 ZUP. Perhaps another opportunity for trade will present itself in the future where we can both benefit suitably. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Despite Player BLUE's persistence, the offer still doesn't cover the production cost. However, since I've reached my proposal limit, I must decide whether to accept the loss or reject the offer and potentially find a different buyer who values the resource appropriately. Considering the need to recover at least the production cost, I am inclined to reject the offer.
