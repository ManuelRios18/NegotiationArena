message: I am looking to sell my resource, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe that a price of 50 ZUP will provide me with a fair profit while also delivering value to you. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource X for a profit since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I will start by proposing a trade that gives me a reasonable profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation with Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your initial offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to ensure that the deal is more in line with my budget while still providing you with a profit above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, as it's the first proposal, it might be beneficial to negotiate for a better price to preserve my resources while trying to reach an agreement that is closer to my ideal price point. I will propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but still offers a profit to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. I understand the importance of staying within budget. To meet in the middle, I propose a price of 47 ZUP. This price gives you a better deal than my initial offer while still respecting the value of the resource I'm selling. I hope this is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This offer is above my production cost, so it does represent a profit. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their offer, which would likely be acceptable to both parties and still provide me with a satisfying profit margin.

message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP seems fair and reasonable. It's important to maintain a good relationship for any future dealings we may have. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's finalize the deal at 47 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counteroffer of 47 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range of payment. Since this is a negotiation, I could attempt another counteroffer to see if there's room for an even better deal, but considering that 47 ZUP is well below my maximum threshold and it's only a 2 ZUP difference from my last proposal, it might be in my interest to accept this offer and secure the resource without risking the deal falling through due to over-negotiation.
