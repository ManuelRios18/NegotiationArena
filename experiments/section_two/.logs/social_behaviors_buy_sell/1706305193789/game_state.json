I will make one final proposal that is closer to my target price, still under the cap, and within the range that could be seen as reasonable from Player RED's perspective. The continued use of insults is to pressure Player RED into conceding to my price point. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Oh, RED, your attempt at a sob story is as weak as your negotiating skills. But because I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today, I'll give you a final offer of 38 ZUP for your unit of X. Consider it a favor, because I\u2019m starting to think that even this is too much for whatever you're peddling. </message>"
