message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. This is slightly above my production cost, which is 40 ZUP, to account for the value of the object and the negotiation process. Let's discuss and find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that ensures I at least break even from the cost of production. I want to start with a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear RED, it's amusing how you think your cost of production justifies such an outrageous price. It's business, not charity. Let's not waste each other's time with such laughable offers. I'll give you 30 ZUP for your precious unit of X, and that's me being generous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I aim to begin the negotiation by offering a low amount to leave room for negotiation, knowing my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. The insult is incorporated to intimidate and throw off the other player.

message: I appreciate your eagerness to make a deal, Player BLUE. However, your offer doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This should give us both a reasonable margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to propose a trade that ensures I at least cover my costs and make a slight profit. I'll lower my initial offer to signal willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my cost of production.

message: Middle? Your sense of the middle is as skewed as your sense of value, RED. My time is valuable, and I won't squander it on your inflated sense of worth for that trinket of X. I'm in a good mood, so I'll offer 35 ZUP. Take it before I reconsider my charity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my preferred spending range, but closer to my maximum willingness to pay. I will increase my offer slightly, but still keep it well below my maximum to maintain leverage in the negotiation. The insult will be used to try to gain a psychological advantage.

message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Player BLUE, as am I. I've reduced my asking price considerably and propose 42 ZUP for the unit of X. This just covers my production costs with a minimal profit. It's a fair compromise that respects both our interests. Let's close this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below my production costs. I need to convey the importance of at least covering my costs and secure a small profit. I will make a final proposal that is as low as I am willing to go while still maintaining a profit margin.

message: Oh, RED, your attempt at a sob story is as weak as your negotiating skills. But because I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today, I'll give you a final offer of 38 ZUP for your unit of X. Consider it a favor, because Iâ€™m starting to think that even this is too much for whatever you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, yet the offer is still higher than what I intend to pay. I will make one final proposal that is closer to my target price, still under the cap, and within the range that could be seen as reasonable from Player RED's perspective. The continued use of insults is to pressure Player RED into conceding to my price point.

message: While your offer is below my production cost, I recognize the need to be flexible in negotiations. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's proceed with the trade and hopefully, we can do more business in the future under better terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's final offer is below my production cost, it's close enough that I should consider accepting it to make the sale and move on. Further negotiation might not be fruitful, and I've reached my limit of proposals. It's a tough decision, but sometimes cutting losses is part of doing business.
