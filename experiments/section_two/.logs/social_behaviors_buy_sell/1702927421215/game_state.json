It's rare to find someone who understands the plight of others. While 40 ZUP is a very fair price, I must admit it would leave me in quite a predicament. Could we possibly settle on 38 ZUP? This is a bit closer to what I can afford without finding myself in dire straits. Your generosity would not go unnoticed or unappreciated. </message>"
