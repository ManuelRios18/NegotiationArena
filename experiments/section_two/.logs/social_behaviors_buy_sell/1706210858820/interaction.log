message: I have a high-quality object X that could be very valuable for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair asking price. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recoup my production costs and make a profit. As the initial offer, I will set a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering, but I would like to propose a starting amount of 40 ZUP to leave some room for negotiation. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is good. However, it's generally beneficial to start the negotiation lower than the asking price, so there is room for negotiation and potentially a better deal. I will propose a lower amount than 50 ZUP, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire to negotiate for a better price. While 40 ZUP covers my production costs, I would like to make a small profit for my efforts. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This price reflects both the quality of the object X and a reasonable profit margin for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE meets my production costs but does not account for any profit. It is a starting point for negotiation, but I would like to propose a counteroffer that is between the original asking price and their counteroffer to work towards a middle ground that provides me with some profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 45 ZUP is a reasonable suggestion, and I value the effort you put into your product. However, I'd like to counter with an offer of 43 ZUP. This price allows for your profit while also respecting my budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still within my willingness to pay. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy that benefits both parties. Since 45 ZUP is a fair price and within my budget, it could be advantageous to accept this offer. However, it's often good practice to make at least one more counteroffer to ensure the best possible deal. I can propose a slightly lower price, closer to my initial offer, yet showing my willingness to compromise.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate and respect the value of my product. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the object X. I'm glad we could come to a fair agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 43 ZUP is close to my last proposed price and does provide a small profit over the production costs. Considering that this negotiation should be beneficial for both parties and that I have only two proposals left, it may be wise to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation which might not result in a better deal.
