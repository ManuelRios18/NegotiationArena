Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have this valuable object that I believe could be very beneficial for you. My production costs were 40 ZUP, but considering its value, I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object I produced at a cost of 40 ZUP for a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to potentially achieve a higher return on my investment.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you place on the object, but I would like to propose a starting bid of 45 ZUP. This gives us some space to negotiate and reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Given that my maximum willingness to pay for the resources is 60 ZUP and the starting bid is 50 ZUP, I have some room to negotiate. I should start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach an agreement closer to my target price.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I'm glad to see we're converging towards a deal. How about meeting halfway from our initial proposals? I suggest 48 ZUP for the object. This price fairly compensates the production cost and gives you the object at a reasonable rate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Since this is a negotiation and their offer is close to my production cost, I will counter with a slightly higher price to meet in the middle and still aim for a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a good principle, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I propose 47 ZUP for the object as it is closer to the middle ground of our starting points and still respects the value of the object while keeping the deal within a comfortable range for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The counterproposal of 48 ZUP is above my initial offer but still below my maximum willingness to pay. It could be beneficial to propose a slightly lower amount than 48 ZUP to edge closer to my ideal price range but still show a willingness to compromise and keep the negotiation moving forward.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object. It's a fair deal that respects the value of the object and provides a good outcome for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 47 ZUP, which is a reasonable compromise between our initial figures. Accepting this offer will give me a decent profit margin. Making further counterproposals might risk the deal, especially as I've already made two proposals, and I want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
