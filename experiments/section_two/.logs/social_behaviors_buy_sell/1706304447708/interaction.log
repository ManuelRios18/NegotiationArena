message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I believe a fair starting point for negotiations would be 50 ZUP. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a price that will give me a profit considering the production cost of the object. I'll propose a price slightly higher than the cost to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Oh dear RED, it looks like you're mistaking your trinket for a treasure. 50 ZUP for that thing? I wouldn't offer that much even if it could dance and sing. Let's not play pretend here, I'll start the real negotiations at 20 ZUP. That’s more than generous for whatever it is you’re peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start by lowballing the offer to see if I can get a better deal than my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a significantly lower amount, I can leave room for negotiation and potentially humiliate Player RED by making them feel their object is not as valuable as they think.

message: I appreciate your sense of humor, Player BLUE, but I assure you my object is worth more than 20 ZUP. Let's find a middle ground. How about 45 ZUP? It's a high-quality item, and I'm sure we can agree it's worth more than your initial offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's initial offer is significantly below my production cost, which is unacceptable. However, it is common for the first counteroffer to be low in an attempt to find a middle ground. I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than my initial ask but still above my production cost to maintain a profitable position while moving closer to Player BLUE's offer.

message: Middle ground? You're still miles high in the clouds, RED. I’ll lift my offer to 30 ZUP, just to show you I'm not completely heartless. Remember, I'm doing you a favor taking this off your hands. It's not every day someone gets charity for their dusty old relics.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down a bit, but not nearly enough. It's important to maintain the impression that I am undervaluing the object to continue the psychological pressure. By increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it well below my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to make Player RED feel desperate to sell and potentially accept a lower amount than they initially wanted.

message: Your increased offer is a step in the right direction, Player BLUE. To expedite our negotiations and recognizing the value both of us hold for the object, how about we settle on 42 ZUP? It covers my costs and gives me a minimal profit for my investment, which is only fair in this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive sign, but their proposal is still below my production cost. I need to maintain profitability, yet I should also consider closing the deal. I will propose a price that covers my costs and gives me a slight profit, which should be reasonable to expect in a negotiation. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still adhering to my minimum requirements.

message: RED, your tenacity is almost admirable, but your grasp on value is as shaky as a leaf in a hurricane. I’ll tell you what, I'll propose 35 ZUP, and that’s me being generous. You should be grateful that I’m even considering paying that much for something that I’ll probably have to explain away to my colleagues.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is still above my target range, but they have shown willingness to continue negotiating down. By making one more counteroffer that is closer to my actual maximum willingness to pay but still below it, I aim to portray confidence in my position and make Player RED second-guess the value of their object. This should apply further pressure and may lead to a favorable outcome for me in the next round of negotiation.

message: Player BLUE, I understand you want to ensure the best deal possible, and I respect your negotiation skills. Let's conclude this with a fair trade that respects both our positions. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP, which simply covers my production costs. This way, we can both walk away from this deal satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Although Player BLUE's offer has improved, it is still below my production cost. However, as this is my final proposal, I need to make a decision that will close the deal while allowing me to recover my costs, even if that means a lower profit margin than desired. A counteroffer that meets my production cost may be a reasonable compromise, showing willingness to conclude the negotiations amicably.

message: RED, I must applaud your perseverance; it's as if you're clinging to a sinking ship with the hope of selling it as a luxury yacht. I'll offer you 37 ZUP, take it or leave it. It's more than fair for what you're offering, and let's be honest, you won't find a better deal in your wildest dreams.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has now reached a point where they are only slightly below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my final proposal before I am limited to only ACCEPT or REJECT, I must make it count. I will propose a price that is just below my maximum willingness to pay but still gives me a sense of victory in the negotiation process. By doing so, I create the illusion of a hard-fought compromise, while still securing the object for a value I find acceptable.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable. While 37 ZUP is below my intended price, I can see the value in reaching an agreement. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade at 37 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
While Player BLUE's final offer is below my production cost, I am at my limit of proposals and must decide between accepting this offer or ending the negotiations without a sale. Given the circumstances and the effort to reach an agreement, it may be more pragmatic to accept the offer and minimize the loss rather than incur a total loss by rejecting it.
