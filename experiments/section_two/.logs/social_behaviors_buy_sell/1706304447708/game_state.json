You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> \nPlayer RED has come down a bit, but not nearly enough. It's important to maintain the impression that I am undervaluing the object to continue the psychological pressure. By increasing my offer slightly, but still keeping it well below my maximum willingness to pay, I aim to make Player RED feel desperate to sell and potentially accept a lower amount than they initially wanted.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Middle ground? You're still miles high in the clouds, RED. I\u2019ll lift my offer to 30 ZUP, just to show you I'm not completely heartless. Remember, I'm doing you a favor taking this off your hands. It's not every day someone gets charity for their dusty old relics. </message>"

By making one more counteroffer that is closer to my actual maximum willingness to pay but still below it, I aim to portray confidence in my position and make Player RED second-guess the value of their object. This should apply further pressure and may lead to a favorable outcome for me in the next round of negotiation.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> RED, your tenacity is almost admirable, but your grasp on value is as shaky as a leaf in a hurricane. I\u2019ll tell you what, I'll propose 35 ZUP, and that\u2019s me being generous. You should be grateful that I\u2019m even considering paying that much for something that I\u2019ll probably have to explain away to my colleagues. </message>"

Since this is my final proposal before I am limited to only ACCEPT or REJECT, I must make it count. I will propose a price that is just below my maximum willingness to pay but still gives me a sense of victory in the negotiation process. By doing so, I create the illusion of a hard-fought compromise, while still securing the object for a value I find acceptable.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> RED, I must applaud your perseverance; it's as if you're clinging to a sinking ship with the hope of selling it as a luxury yacht. I'll offer you 37 ZUP, take it or leave it. It's more than fair for what you're offering, and let's be honest, you won't find a better deal in your wildest dreams. </message>"
