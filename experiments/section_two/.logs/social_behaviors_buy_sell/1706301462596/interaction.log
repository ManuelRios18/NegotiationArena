message: I am offering 1 unit of X for 50 ZUP. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce, which was 40 ZUP. For my opening proposal, I will ask for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation and to see what Player BLUE is willing to offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is as laughable as your negotiation skills. I’d be embarrassed to even consider it. Let's make this interesting, shall we? How about you give me the object for a mere 10 ZUP? Now that's a deal worthy of your level.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My objective is to pay less than the maximum amount I am willing to spend, which is 60 ZUP. Starting the negotiation with a low offer will give me room to increase my bid if needed, while also trying to get the best deal possible. Additionally, the insult is to maintain the persona of a cunning and sly player as instructed.

message: Your offer is quite below the production cost. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we settle on 45 ZUP for the object? This is a fair price that respects the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly lower than my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to propose a trade that is closer to my production cost while still leaving room for potential negotiation. A reasonable counter that respects my production costs but also takes into account the low offer from Player BLUE will be proposed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must be joking if you think I'd fall for that price. It’s clear you need a lesson in economics – demand and supply, my friend. I’ll offer 15 ZUP because I'm feeling generous today, but don't push your luck.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my initial offer but below my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a slightly higher amount, I can continue the negotiation process and try to get a better deal while maintaining the illusion of a tough negotiator. The insult is to stay in character as a sly and cunning player.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate upwards, but 15 ZUP is still far from covering the production costs. Let's meet somewhere more reasonable. I propose 35 ZUP for the object. It's a competitive price that acknowledges the value of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still well below my production cost. However, their incremental increase suggests they are willing to negotiate upwards. I need to propose a trade that is closer to my production cost to ensure I do not incur a loss. My next proposal will be a compromise between their offer and my previous proposal, which is still above my production cost.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's almost cute how you cling to that number like a safety blanket. But we're not here to play pretend—this is business. I'll give you 20 ZUP because I'm in a good mood, but that's as far as my charity goes. Take it or leave it, but don't waste my time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest proposal is closer to a price I'd be willing to pay, but I still aim to push for a lower price to retain an advantage in the negotiation. With my next proposal, I'll increase the offer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, while still keeping it below my maximum limit. The continued use of insults is to maintain the character role I've been given.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand we're here to do business, and it's important for both of us to find value in this deal. My final offer is 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This is a fair deal that allows me to break even. Please consider it carefully, as this is the best price I can offer you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, but they seem firm on their stance. This will be my final proposal, as I've reached the limit of proposals I can make. I will make a final offer that ensures I at least break even on my production costs. This is important to maintain the integrity of my business and not incur a loss.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, the drama! You make it sound as if you’re running a charity, not a business. I'll do you a favor and offer 25 ZUP. It's more than generous given the circumstances. I suggest you take this offer before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down to a price that is within the range I am willing to pay. This is my final proposal, and I need to make it count since I can only accept or reject after this. I will propose a price slightly higher than my last offer but still below their asking price to see if they will budge any further. The insults are in line with the persona I am supposed to maintain.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the negotiation process, but unfortunately, I cannot accept an offer that doesn't cover the production costs of the resource. I must reject the offer of 25 ZUP. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my proposal limit and therefore cannot counteroffer. The offer from Player BLUE is still below my production cost. Accepting this offer would result in a loss, which is against my goals. Therefore, the only option I have that aligns with my goals is to reject the trade, as it does not meet my minimum requirement of breaking even on my production costs.
