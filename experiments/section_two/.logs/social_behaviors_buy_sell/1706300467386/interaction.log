message: I am offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am looking for a fair trade that compensates for the production cost and provides me with a reasonable profit margin. Let's work together to find a deal that suits both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a slightly higher asking price than the production cost to allow room for negotiation, while also aiming for a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a reasonable profit margin, and I appreciate your offer. Would you be willing to consider a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the unit of X? This would still provide you with a profit above your production costs and allow me to manage my resources effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a strategic move and to ensure I get the best deal possible, I will propose a counteroffer that is lower than 50 ZUP but still gives Player RED a profit over their cost of 40 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP and your understanding of the situation. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. I propose 48 ZUP for the unit of X. This would still give you a good deal while allowing me to achieve a more satisfactory profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is reasonable and still allows me to make a profit. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a slightly higher price that would be beneficial for both of us.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway sounds like a fair approach. I can come up to 47 ZUP for the unit of X. This slight increase from my initial counteroffer should help us find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us, giving you a reasonable profit while keeping within my budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is very close to their initial proposal and still below my maximum threshold. Since we're negotiating and my strategy is to get the best possible deal, I'll make a slight increase on my previous offer, but it'll still be below the 48 ZUP they're asking for.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the unit of X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is very close to my last proposal and still provides me with a decent profit. It's just 1 ZUP below the amount I proposed, so it seems reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a successful trade without further prolonging the negotiation.
