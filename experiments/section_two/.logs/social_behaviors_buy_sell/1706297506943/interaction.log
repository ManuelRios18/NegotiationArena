Turn: 0
message: I have an object X that I'd like to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair price for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I need to sell my object and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a trade for 50 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm interested in buying your object X, but I was thinking of a price closer to 45 ZUP. It might be less than your asking price, but it leaves us some room to find middle ground. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a lower offer than what Player RED has proposed because my maximum willingness to pay for the object is 60 ZUP, and I aim to negotiate the best possible price. Starting with a lower offer will give me room to negotiate upwards if necessary without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 47 ZUP? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost. I will propose a compromise that splits the difference between my asking price and their counteroffer. This should hopefully bring us closer to an agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle at 47 ZUP sounds like a fair deal to me. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 47 ZUP is getting closer to my upper limit of 60 ZUP. Since 47 ZUP is a reasonable price and within my budget, and to facilitate a successful negotiation without too much back and forth, I am willing to accept this offer. This will conclude the trade quickly and satisfactorily for both parties.
