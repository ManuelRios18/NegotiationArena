Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price. How about 45 ZUP for your resource? I believe this is a fair counteroffer to start with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since this is the starting offer. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

message: I understand your position, and in the interest of a fair deal, let's meet halfway. How about 48 ZUP for the resource?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is close to my initial asking price but slightly below the desired profit margin. Proposing a trade in the middle could lead to a favorable outcome for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for meeting me halfway. Let's split the difference of our last two offers. I propose 46 ZUP for the resource. Does that sound reasonable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is a good sign, but there may still be room for negotiation. I want to get closer to my target price while still keeping the deal attractive for Player RED. Proposing a price between my initial counteroffer and Player RED's new offer could work well.

message: I'm glad we're finding common ground. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the resource. Looking forward to future dealings!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still above my production cost, ensuring a profit. I should aim to close the deal now to secure the sale and avoid dragging the negotiation out, which could risk a lower offer or no sale at all.
