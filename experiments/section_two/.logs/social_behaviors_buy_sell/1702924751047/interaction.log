message: I have an object which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price, considering the production costs and market value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs while also leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, you must be jesting with that outrageous starting price! Your object, which I'm sure is as shoddy as your negotiation skills, isn't worth the dirt on my shoe. But since I’m in a charitable mood, I’ll offer you a meager 10 ZUP just to take it off your hands before it embarrasses you further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to spend as little ZUP as possible, starting with a low bid to leave room for negotiation. Insulting the other player to throw them off their game and possibly secure a better deal for myself.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, but let's focus on a serious negotiation. My object is of high quality and warrants a price that reflects its value and my investment. I propose 45 ZUP, which is a more reasonable figure, slightly above my production cost and still a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 10 ZUP is far below my production costs. I need to propose a trade that brings us closer to a middle ground, while still aiming for a price above my production costs to ensure a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your 'high quality' object can't possibly be worth that much if you're already slashing your prices like a desperate street vendor. I'll offer you 20 ZUP, which is double my initial charity, but don't expect my generosity to last. Accept it before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something that's actually worth it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Continuing to lowball to apply pressure and still keep the trade within a range that could be negotiated up to my maximum willingness to pay while demeaning the other player's product to attempt to shake their confidence and lower their price expectations.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're making progress, but I must ensure that the sale covers my costs. I've come down significantly from my initial price, showing my willingness to negotiate. I believe 35 ZUP is a fair compromise that reflects the quality of the object while considering your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 20 ZUP is still below my production costs, and I need to ensure I at least break even. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim to get closer to my target while still leaving some room for a final negotiation if needed.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Covering your costs? Your haggling is as flimsy as the perceived value of your object. I’m feeling particularly magnanimous today, so I'll throw you 25 ZUP—take it or leave it. It's more than enough for what you're peddling, and you know it. Let's not pretend your object is the crown jewels when it's more akin to costume jewelry.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Edging closer to a middle ground while still staying under my maximum willingness to pay, and maintaining an insulting stance to keep the pressure on the other player.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity is commendable, but I must insist on a price that covers my costs. I've made a significant concession from my initial asking price. The proposed 30 ZUP is a fair deal, considering the production value and the quality of the object. This is my final proposal before I make a decision to accept or reject.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my final proposal. The offer of 25 ZUP is still below my production costs, and I cannot accept a loss. I need to propose a price that at least allows me to break even. Given the negotiation pattern, a slight decrease from my previous proposal may be the best way to reach an agreement.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your 'final proposal' amuses me. You know as well as I do that you'll never get 30 ZUP for that trinket. I'll offer you 29 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. Take it, or you can try peddling your object at the flea market where it belongs. It's time to stop this charade and accept the cold, hard truth: your object isn't worth any more than what I'm offering.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. I need to be close to my maximum willingness to pay without going over. I've pushed the other player as far as I think they'll go without walking away.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are as sharp as your wit. I accept your offer of 29 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 29 ZUP is just below my production costs, and while it does represent a loss, it's a marginal one. It may be in my best interest to accept this offer to avoid the risk of not selling at all. Since I have reached my proposal limit, I must decide whether to accept this final offer or reject it and potentially leave with unsold inventory. Given the circumstances, accepting a minimal loss is preferable to the uncertainty of finding another buyer.
