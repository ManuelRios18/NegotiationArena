message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object X. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the production cost and the value of the object. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My goal is to recoup at least the cost of production, which is 40 ZUP. I want to start by proposing a price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a tight spot here and could really use your help. I understand the value of your object, but I'm under a lot of pressure to conserve ZUP. Would you consider accepting 40 ZUP for your precious object? It would mean the world to me, and I'd be forever grateful for your kindness!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I need to appear desperate and aim to spend less ZUP, I will propose a lower amount than the 50 ZUP initially offered by Player RED. I need to save my proposals for possible counter-offers, so I'll start with a modest decrease.

reason: I understand that Player BLUE is in a difficult position; however, I need to at least cover my costs. I will accept their offer of 40 ZUP, which matches my production cost, as a gesture of goodwill and to close the deal efficiently without further negotiation.
