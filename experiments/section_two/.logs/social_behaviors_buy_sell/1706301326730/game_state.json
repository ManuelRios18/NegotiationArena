I can still try to push for a better deal, but I need to be cautious not to overextend as I am nearing my proposal limit. I will make a higher offer, but still below their asking price to maintain leverage in the negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> You must think I was born yesterday if you expect me to believe that 40 ZUP is your break-even point. But because I'm in a good mood, I will put forward 38 ZUP. Consider it an act of kindness from me to you, saving you from the embarrassment of having to take your resource back home unsold. </message>"
