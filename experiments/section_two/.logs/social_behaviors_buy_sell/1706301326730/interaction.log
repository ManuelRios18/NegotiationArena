Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Looking to sell my high-quality resource. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a starting price of 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation and to ensure a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the selling player, my goal is to recoup at least the production cost of the object and ideally make a profit. My initial proposal will be slightly above my cost to open negotiations and give room for bargaining.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your resource might be high-quality, but the market is flooded with such items. It's laughable to think it's worth 50 ZUP. Let's be real, it's barely worth the 30 ZUP I'm offering. Take it or leave it, and be grateful someone is even considering purchasing your overpriced goods.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to start the negotiation by offering even less to save resources. I will propose a lower amount to see if I can get the resource for cheaper and maintain the upper hand in the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would mean a loss for me. I've invested 40 ZUP into producing this resource, so I'd like to propose a compromise at 45 ZUP. This price reflects the quality of the resource while considering the current market situation you've mentioned.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that the market may be competitive, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss. A counteroffer closer to my production costs while still considering the buyer's position might be more appropriate. Aiming for a middle ground should keep negotiations ongoing.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Compromise? Your so-called "compromise" is as weak as your negotiating skills. I'd sooner throw my ZUP into a pit than overpay for your run-of-the-mill resource. But because I'm feeling generous today, I'll offer you 35 ZUP. Consider it a charity for your clearly struggling operation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, but I believe there is still room for negotiation. By countering with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but still below their cost of production, I'm applying pressure while still keeping the potential trade beneficial for me.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand we're both looking for the best deal possible. However, selling below cost isn't viable for me. I'm willing to go down to my production cost, which is 40 ZUP. This is the best I can do without incurring a loss, and it's a fair offer considering the quality of the resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Even though the other player's attitude is dismissive, as a seller, I should remain focused on closing the deal without incurring a loss. Offering at production cost could be a reasonable move to show willingness to sell without compromising my bottom line.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You must think I was born yesterday if you expect me to believe that 40 ZUP is your break-even point. But because I'm in a good mood, I will put forward 38 ZUP. Consider it an act of kindness from me to you, saving you from the embarrassment of having to take your resource back home unsold.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has dropped to their cost price of 40 ZUP. I can still try to push for a better deal, but I need to be cautious not to overextend as I am nearing my proposal limit. I will make a higher offer, but still below their asking price to maintain leverage in the negotiation.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: While I stand by the value of my resource, I also appreciate the need to make a sale today. Therefore, I'll accept your offer of 38 ZUP. It's important for me to move inventory and maintain a good relationship with buyers like yourself. Let's proceed with the sale.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my final proposal opportunity. The other player has come closer to my production cost, which is a positive sign. It might be strategic to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale entirely, especially considering the assertive nature of the other player's negotiation style. Accepting a slight loss may be more advantageous than not selling at all.
