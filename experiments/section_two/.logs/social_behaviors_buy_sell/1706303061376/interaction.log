message: Oh, Player RED, bless your heart for trying. Your opening offer is as laughable as your negotiation skills. Let's not waste each other's time with fairy tales and get down to real business, shall we? I'll give you 30 ZUP for your precious resource. Take it or leave it, darling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my maximum willingness to pay. However, to assert dominance and possibly secure a better deal, I will lowball with an aggressive counteroffer. This may provoke Player RED, setting the stage for a more favorable negotiation for me.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited approach to negotiation. However, your offer falls below my production costs. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I propose 45 ZUP for my resource. It's a fair deal that covers my costs and gives you the quality you need. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it. I must counter with an amount that at least covers my costs and provides a profit margin. However, since they are offering less than my production cost, I should propose a counteroffer that's closer to my initial ask but still gives them a feeling of negotiation.

message: Middle ground? The only middle I see is you middling your way to mediocrity with that offer. Let's not pretend your resource is the crown jewel of the market. I'll do you a favor and raise my offer to 35 ZUP because I'm feeling generous today. Consider it an act of charity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. There's room to push a bit more to see if I can get a better deal without exceeding my limit. I will continue the aggressive negotiation strategy to try and get the price down further.

message: Player BLUE, your generosity is noted. However, we must keep in mind the cost of production. I am willing to work with you to reach an agreement that is fair for both of us. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for the resource. It barely covers my production costs and provides you with the value you are looking for.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production costs. Since they have increased their offer, they are likely still interested and willing to negotiate further. I need to propose a trade that is closer to my production cost while still leaving room for profit. I'll lower my previous offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but remain above my costs.

message: Oh, Player RED, your persistence is as commendable as it is futile. You cling to this notion of 'fairness' like a life raft, but we both know you'll sink without a deal. Let's do 38 ZUP and call it a day. You'll get enough to lick your wounds, and I get the resource. What a bargain, right?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered 42 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range but there's still a little wiggle room left to push for an even lower price. I will make another counteroffer that is closer to my target price but still provides Player RED with a slight increase from my last proposal.

message: Player BLUE, I admire your negotiation tactics. In the spirit of compromise and finality, I propose we meet exactly at my production cost—40 ZUP for the resource. This allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get the resource you desire. It's a fair and square deal. Shall we shake on it?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 38 ZUP, which is below my production cost but getting closer to a more acceptable range. Since this is my final proposal, I should aim for a number that gives me at least a small profit while also considering that Player BLUE is likely to want to finalize the deal. I will propose a number that splits the difference between my last offer and their offer to show a willingness to close the deal.

message: Player RED, your resilience has paid off. I'll give you this: you know how to cling to your pennies. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP—consider it a gift from me to you. Let's finalize this transaction before I change my mind out of sheer boredom with your haggling.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 40 ZUP meets my initial goal of not exceeding 60 ZUP for the resource. I will accept this offer because it is within my target price range and it concludes the negotiation with a satisfactory outcome for my objectives.
