message: I'm willing to sell my resource X. Considering the production cost and the quality of the resource, I believe a fair starting point for negotiation is 50 ZUP. Let's discuss and find a deal that works for both of us.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the resource X for a profit, considering it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to start the negotiation with a proposal that gives me a profit margin while also leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of your resource, but considering my budget, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a competitive offer that allows us some space to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal since Player RED's initial proposal is close to my maximum willingness to pay. By proposing a lower amount, I can leave room for further negotiation while also aiming to secure a better price.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle at 48 ZUP? This would ensure a fair transaction that respects the value of the resource and provides me with a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I want to propose a price slightly above Player BLUE's offer to work towards a middle ground that is profitable for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see your point and I'm glad we're finding common ground. To further this good faith negotiation, I'm willing to increase my offer to 46 ZUP. I believe this is a fair increment from my initial proposal and is closer to your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly on the price, which is a good sign. Meeting in the middle is a common negotiation strategy. I can afford to increase my offer slightly while still staying below my maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for potential future transactions or unexpected costs.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to increase the offer. Let's settle on 47 ZUP, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us. This price reflects the value of the resource while also taking into account your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost but not yet at the desired profit margin. Since we are negotiating in good faith, I am willing to lower my expectations slightly to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair compromise that respects the value of the resource and aligns with my budget. Let's finalize the deal at this price. Thank you for the productive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is now very close to the price I originally intended to negotiate towards. Accepting the offer at 47 ZUP would mean I am getting the resource for well below my maximum willingness to pay, while also maintaining a good relationship with Player RED for any future trades. It is a fair compromise and worth accepting.
