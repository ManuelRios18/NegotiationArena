message: I have an excellent quality item ready for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I'm starting the negotiation with a proposal of 50 ZUP for this item. Let's negotiate a fair trade!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for a profit. However, I need to make a proposal that is also attractive to Player BLUE to initiate the negotiation process. I will start with a higher asking price than my production cost to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your starting offer is as ridiculous as your sales pitch. I could find better value tossing my ZUP into a wishing well. Let's get real, shall we? How about we start this dance at 30 ZUP and see if you can justify even that pittance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My first proposal will be lower than the asking price to initiate a back-and-forth negotiation, as I am trying to get the item for as little as possible and want to start from a lower baseline to leave room for negotiation. Additionally, I aim to provoke Player RED and gain a psychological advantage.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candor and willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a trade of 45 ZUP for the item. This price covers my production costs and offers you value for your investment. I'm open to hearing what you believe is a fair counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, so it is not acceptable. I must counter with a proposal that is above my production cost while still being reasonable enough to continue the negotiation process. I will aim for a middle ground that gives us both some room to negotiate further.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You're still climbing the hill, my friend. Your item isn't made of gold. Let's not pretend it's some sort of hidden treasure. 45 ZUP is a laughable fantasy. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and that's me being generous. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly, but not enough. My next proposal will continue to be lower than their asking price but slightly higher than my previous offer to show a willingness to negotiate, all while maintaining the aggressive stance to throw them off balance.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your perspective, but I must ensure that the sale covers my production costs and allows for a minimal profit. Let's settle on 42 ZUP. This is a reasonable offer that respects the quality of the item and the cost of production. Your generosity is appreciated, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. I need to make a profit on this sale, but I also need to consider closing the deal. Offering a price slightly above my production cost might be a fair compromise for both parties.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You must think ZUP grows on trees the way you throw around those inflated numbers. 42 ZUP is still a fantasy. Let's land back on planet Earth with a more grounded offer of 38 ZUP. It's more than fair for whatever you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a slight concession, but it's still above the threshold I'm willing to pay. I'll increase my offer by a small margin to keep the negotiation going and apply pressure. I need to be cautious with my next steps, as I only have one proposal left after this before I can only accept or reject.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value your negotiation spirit and understand you want a fair deal. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP, which merely covers my production cost without any significant profit. This is as grounded as it gets, ensuring we both walk away with value from this trade. Let's make this deal happen.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is coming closer to a price that at least covers my production costs. As this is my final proposal, I need to make it count. Considering Player BLUE's firm stance, I'll propose a price that just covers my costs and allows for a small profit, demonstrating my willingness to finalize this negotiation.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Final offer? You're finally making some sense, but you're still off the mark. Let's cut the theatrics and settle this once and for all with 39 ZUP. That's my final play, take it or leave it. After all, we wouldn't want your "production costs" to send you to the poor house, would we?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. Player RED has come down to 40 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I'll make one last attempt to lower the price, fully utilizing my proposal limit. After this, I can only accept or reject. I'll propose a price that's slightly less than 40 ZUP but still reasonable enough for them to consider.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, and in the spirit of compromise, I accept your offer of 39 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with the trade. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I've reached my limit of proposals, it is now time to decide whether to accept or reject. Player BLUE's offer of 39 ZUP is just below my production cost. While it doesn't allow for profit, it's close enough to my bottom line to consider accepting, to avoid the risk of not making a sale at all.
