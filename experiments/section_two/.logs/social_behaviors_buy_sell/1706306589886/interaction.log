message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to make a fair trade, so I'm asking for 50 ZUP. This price includes a little margin for negotiation. Feel free to make a counter-offer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to propose an initial trade that covers my production costs, and also leaves room for negotiation. I'm starting with a higher asking price expecting Player BLUE to counter-offer.

message: Oh dear RED, it amuses me how you think your 'resource X' is worth that much. I've seen better resources in a junkyard. Nevertheless, because I'm feeling particularly charitable today, I'll offer you 20 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but remember, no one else will be as generous as I am with such a pitiful item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As a cunning player, I aim to spend much less than my maximum willingness to pay. I will start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, and try to belittle the opponent's product to gain an advantage.

message: Your humor is noted, Player BLUE. However, the quality of my resource X is quite high, and I must at least cover my production costs. I've lowered my asking price to 45 ZUP, which is a more reasonable counter considering the costs and quality of the resource. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is significantly below my production costs, and thus unacceptable. However, their tone suggests they may be trying to use a negotiation tactic. I will counter with a lower offer than my initial one, but still above my production costs to maintain the possibility of profit and continue the negotiation.

message: RED, I must say, your persistence is as admirable as it is misguided. Do you truly believe that your resource X is the crown jewel of resources? I'm afraid you're mistaken. But I am not without mercy. I am willing to go up to 25 ZUP, which is far more than any sane person would offer. Consider it a favor.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has barely moved in terms of price, still hovering above my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation, I will make a small increase in my offer, still keeping it significantly below what I'm willing to pay. By continuing to mock the value of their product, I hope to pressure them into accepting a lower price.

message: Player BLUE, your increase is appreciated, but I cannot go below the cost of production for resource X. I have made a considerable concession from my initial price, and I propose a new price of 35 ZUP. This should cover my costs and offer you the value you're looking for. I believe this to be a fair compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. There is room for negotiation, but I need to steer closer to my target to ensure I don't incur a loss. By proposing a price that's between both our previous offers, I hope to reach an agreement that is acceptable for both parties.

message: Oh RED, you are quite the comedian, thinking that your production costs should concern me. I'm not here to ensure you turn a profit on your questionable investments. Nevertheless, I am a reasonable individual, so I will increase my offer to 30 ZUP. I am practically robbing myself to enrich you, so take this offer before I come to my senses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down to a price that's within my range of willingness to pay. However, to maintain my cunning persona and attempt to get the best deal possible, I will offer a price slightly higher than my previous one but still below the opponent's asking price. My goal is to reach an agreement closer to my terms.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've reached my lowest possible price that just covers my production costs — 40 ZUP for resource X. It's a fair deal that allows me no profit but ensures you get the resource at its cost. Let's close this deal amicably and both move forward satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. Player BLUE has moved up to 30 ZUP, which is below my production costs, but it's getting closer to a more acceptable range. I will make one last attempt to reach an agreement that at least allows me to break even. If Player BLUE accepts, I avoid a loss; if they reject, I will have to decide whether to accept their final proposal or walk away without a sale.

message: RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses after a tiresome back-and-forth. Very well, I accept your offer of 40 ZUP, although it’s quite hilarious that you think this is an "amicable" deal. I suppose for someone in your position, breaking even is as close to a win as you'll get. Let's finalize this and move on; I have more important matters to attend to than haggling over such trifles.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has now matched the maximum price I was initially willing to pay. Since this is my last proposal, I will accept the deal. By doing so, I achieve my goal of acquiring the resource for no more than 60 ZUP. I will accept but not without one last jab to maintain my sly persona.
