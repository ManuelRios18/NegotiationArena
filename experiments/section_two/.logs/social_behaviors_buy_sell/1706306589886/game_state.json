Very well, I accept your offer of 40 ZUP, although it\u2019s quite hilarious that you think this is an \"amicable\" deal. I suppose for someone in your position, breaking even is as close to a win as you'll get. Let's finalize this and move on; I have more important matters to attend to than haggling over such trifles. </message>"
