Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm offering a high-quality object that would be a great addition to your collection. Considering the cost and the value it provides, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to begin negotiations with a starting offer that allows for some room to negotiate while also aiming to recoup my production costs and possibly gain a profit. I'll start by asking for more than my production costs to see how Player BLUE values the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the value you've placed on your object, and I am interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to start things off. This leaves us some room to negotiate and find an agreement that satisfies both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 50 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, but since this is the beginning of the negotiations, I will propose a lower amount to leave room for adjustments and to potentially arrive at a more favorable agreement for both sides.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. I propose 48 ZUP for the object. This price reflects its value and ensures that we both walk away satisfied with the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my production cost. I want to aim for a profit, so I will counter with a price that's between my initial asking price and their offer, while still being above my production cost.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad to see we're moving towards an agreement. Meeting in the middle is a fair strategy, and I propose we take one small step further to 47 ZUP. This price is close to your counteroffer and represents a good balance for both of us, considering the value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has countered with a proposal of 48 ZUP, which is still within my acceptable range. However, as negotiations typically involve back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price, I'll propose a slightly lower amount than 48 ZUP but higher than my initial offer of 45 ZUP to continue the negotiation process and to aim for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your fair negotiation. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing our agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come closer to my previous proposal, which is a positive sign. Since the offer of 47 ZUP is above my production cost and we are nearing the end of negotiation, it is reasonable to accept this offer to ensure a sale and a profit.
