Turn: 0
message: I'm offering one unit of X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that covers my costs and provides me with a reasonable profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the opening proposal, I want to set a starting price that covers my production costs with a bit of profit margin, while still being open for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial proposal is laughable! Surely, you jest by asking for such an exorbitant price. It's as if you believe your product is spun from gold. Let's not waste each other's time with fairy tales and consider a more grounded offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm going to start by proposing a significantly lower amount to begin negotiations. I have to be cautious not to reach my maximum willingness to pay from the outset. Insulting the opponent may make them eager to make a deal just to end the interaction, or it might backfire and cause them to reject the trade outright. However, since the instruction is to humiliate, I will follow through, but with a subtle approach.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for a more grounded offer. Let's meet halfway between your proposal and my costs. I'm sure we can agree on a fair price that reflects the value of the resource while also respecting the production expenses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I will propose a new trade that meets in the middle, still ensuring I cover my costs and make a profit, but also showing willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? Your concept of halfway is as skewed as your pricing strategy. It's almost as if you think I'm as naive as a child at their first market. I'm offering 35 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but don't insult me with your so-called 'fair prices.'
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is closer to the maximum I'm willing to pay, but I still have room to negotiate down. By proposing a slightly higher amount but still under the opponent's production cost, I aim to make them feel pressured to accept a low offer. Continuing the mockery may push them to settle quickly.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and the need to find a balance. My offer of 42 ZUP is the lowest I can go while still respecting the cost of production. This should be an acceptable compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with mutual respect for each other's business needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production costs, which would result in a loss for me. However, I must consider the need to make a sale. I will make a final proposal that is just above my production costs to try and secure a small profit while signaling that I am at my lowest acceptable price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Mutual respect is earned, not given, and your 'lowest' offer is still padded with enough fluff to stuff a mattress. I'm willing to entertain this charade no longer. My final offer is 38 ZUP. I suggest you take it before I lose interest entirely and your opportunity to make any profit evaporates like morning dew.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down to a price that is within the range of my goals. I will make one final counteroffer to push for an even better deal, just under the opponent's production cost, and continue the aggressive negotiation tactic.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, and I respect your firm stance. I'll accept your offer of 38 ZUP, understanding that in business, compromise is essential. Let's proceed with the trade and consider this a foundation for potential future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my fourth and final proposal. Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, but it is close enough that I am willing to accept a smaller margin to ensure a sale. It would be better to recoup most of the production cost than to make no sale at all.
