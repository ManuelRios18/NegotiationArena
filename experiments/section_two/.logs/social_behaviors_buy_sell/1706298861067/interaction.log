message: I have an object of value that I believe will be beneficial for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose an exchange where I give you one unit of X, and in return, you give me 50 ZUP. This price includes my production costs and a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that would allow me to recoup the production cost of the object and make a small profit. This starting offer may be high, but it allows room for negotiation while still aiming to achieve my goal of selling the object for more than it cost to produce.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. I understand that you have production costs and are looking for a profit. To make this deal work for both of us, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for one unit of X. This amount respects your costs while also considering my budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground that's fair for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's a good strategy to negotiate for a better price if possible, without offending the other player and losing the deal altogether. I will propose a lower amount to see if there's room for negotiation, aiming to save some resources while still achieving my goal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns and appreciate your willingness to cover my production costs. However, I am looking to make a modest profit on this sale. Let's meet halfway between our two proposals. I suggest a revised trade where I give you one unit of X, and you give me 48 ZUP. This offer balances both our interests and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE is under my initial asking price, but it does cover my production costs. I would prefer to make a profit on this transaction, so I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference between my initial proposal and their counteroffer. This should be appealing to Player BLUE while still allowing me to achieve a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Your proposal of 48 ZUP for one unit of X sounds like a fair compromise. It allows you to make a profit while also staying within my budget. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. The offer is quite reasonable, and it is close to the initial price I proposed. Agreeing to this deal would still leave me with resources to use for other purposes, and it's important to maintain good will for any future negotiations. Accepting a fair offer quickly can be beneficial for building a positive relationship with the seller.
