message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resources. I've invested 40 ZUP into it and I'm hoping to make a small profit. How about 50 ZUP for the object?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I will propose a starting trade that allows me to recoup the production costs. I'll start with a slightly higher asking price to allow room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in quite a bind and really need these resources, but ZUP is so hard to come by these days. I can barely make ends meet! Would you consider 45 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I would be so grateful for your help.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I need to act desperate to attempt to lower the price further. My first proposal will be lower than what they're asking but still within a reasonable range so that negotiations can continue.

message: I understand that ZUP is precious, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch to 45 ZUP. However, I was hoping for a bit more to make this trade worthwhile for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at 48 ZUP. This should cover my costs and give me a modest profit while still being fair to you. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP. It's slightly above my production costs, so it's a reasonable offer. However, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that's a bit higher, to try and secure a better profit margin while still being fair to Player BLUE's situation.

message: You have a kind heart, Player RED, and I'm touched by your understanding. ZUP is indeed precious, and every single ZUP saved means a lot to me. I'm stretching my resources thin, but I can try to meet you a bit further. Could we perhaps settle on 46 ZUP? Your generosity would not be forgotten.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to maintain my position of desperation and potentially get a better deal, I should propose a slightly lower amount, nudging closer to their last offer without meeting it entirely. This keeps negotiations open and might lead to a more favorable outcome for me.

message: Thank you for your kind words, Player BLUE. I can see that you value the resources highly and are doing your best to negotiate fairly. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the resources. Let's proceed with the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a new proposal of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost. Considering that Player BLUE is making an effort to negotiate in good faith and appears to be in need, it might be beneficial to accept this offer, ensuring a quick sale and a positive relationship for any future interactions.
