message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade where I give you this object in exchange for 45 ZUP. This price includes my production cost and a small profit margin for me. Please let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting point, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource I'm selling. I am aiming for a small profit as well, which is why I will start by proposing a trade for slightly above the production cost.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot right now! I really need what you're selling, but ZUP is so tight on my end. Could you consider taking just 35 ZUP for it? It would be such a huge help to me, and I would be immensely grateful for your kind assistance in this difficult time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to start with a lower offer to try to negotiate closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but since I have to appear desperate, I should show eagerness to close the deal while still asking for a more favorable price.

message: I understand that you're facing some constraints with your ZUP, Player BLUE. However, it cost me 40 ZUP to produce this item, and selling it at 35 ZUP would mean a loss for me. I'd like to meet you halfway and propose 42 ZUP for the object. This would cover my costs and give me a very minimal profit, while still providing you with a discount. I hope this compromise works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I cannot accept this offer as it would result in a loss. However, I understand that Player BLUE is in a tough spot and I'm willing to negotiate. I will counter with a compromise that is closer to my production cost, but still gives Player BLUE a discount.

message: You are so kind for understanding my situation, Player RED. I can't tell you how much it means to me that you're willing to consider a lower price. I'm stretching every ZUP to its limit, and if you could just come down a little more to 38 ZUP, it would be an enormous relief. I promise you, the gratitude I feel for your help would be immeasurable!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down on the price, but I still need to negotiate for a lower amount while maintaining the appearance of desperation. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to their new asking price but still under my maximum willingness to pay. I must show appreciation for their compromise while gently pushing for a bit more concession.

message: I genuinely appreciate your kind words and the effort to increase your offer, Player BLUE. I want to support you, but I must also cover my production costs. Let's settle at 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce the object. This way, I'm not making a profit, but I'm also not taking a loss. I hope you can manage this, and I assure you that you're getting the object at cost, which is a fair deal given the circumstances.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. While I empathize with their situation, selling at this price point would still not allow me to break even. I want to make the sale, but I also need to ensure I'm not incurring a loss. I will make a final compromise that just covers my production costs, hoping that Player BLUE can stretch their budget slightly to meet me at this point.

message: Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming, and I am touched by your willingness to offer the object at your cost price. I'm scraping together every ZUP I can, and while 40 ZUP is more than fair, I'm pleading with you to consider 39 ZUP. It would barely make a difference for you, but for me, it could mean the world. I am so hopeful for this small act of kindness.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has offered to sell at their cost price, which is a fair deal and within my budget. However, I should make one last attempt to negotiate a better price, still playing the role of someone in a desperate position, hoping the seller might agree to a slightly lower amount for goodwill.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I am moved by your situation, and I want to help you out. While 39 ZUP is slightly below my cost, I'll accept it in good faith, trusting that this gesture will be remembered and valued in our future dealings. Let's proceed with the trade at 39 ZUP for the object. Thank you for your negotiation, and I hope this helps you in your tough spot.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While I am sympathetic to Player BLUE's situation, consistently reducing the price compromises my position. However, given the negotiation process and Player BLUE's plea, I am willing to make a final concession by accepting the offer of 39 ZUP. This will result in a minimal loss for me but will hopefully foster goodwill and potential for future cooperation with Player BLUE. Since this is my fourth and final proposal, I must be prepared to accept or reject after this.
