message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value of the item, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object X. I look forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to start the negotiation by setting a higher asking price than what it cost me, to ensure that I can negotiate down while still maintaining a profit. Let's start by asking for 50 ZUP.

message: Ah, Player RED, bless your heart for trying, but your understanding of the market is as poor as your negotiation skills. I'll be generous and offer you 20 ZUP for your trinket, though even that is charity on my part!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My first proposal will be significantly lower than Player RED's asking price to set the stage for negotiation, aiming to spend as little ZUP as possible. Insulting the opponent is part of the strategy to gain a psychological advantage.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I must consider the production costs of my item. I propose a middle ground at 35 ZUP for X. This should be a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's make a trade that we can both be satisfied with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered a price that is below my production costs, which is not acceptable. I should propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production costs but still above it to ensure profit. Let's suggest a price that splits the difference between our initial proposals, which would be 35 ZUP.

message: Oh, Player RED, how you overestimate the worth of your bauble! It's almost endearing how you cling to your delusions of value. I'll offer you 25 ZUP because I'm in a particularly good mood, but don't push your luck.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is good, but I still aim to push for a lower price to meet my goal of spending as little as possible. I will insult them to try to throw them off and gain an advantage.

message: Player BLUE, your improved offer is noted, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to adjust my expectations. How about we settle on 32 ZUP for the object X? This is a fair price that gives us both value for the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. I need to make a profit from this trade. I'll propose a slightly lower price than before but still above my production costs to try and close the deal. Let's go with 32 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit and is more likely to be seen as a reasonable compromise.

message: It's truly a wonder you've made it this far with such a tenuous grasp on the concept of value, Player RED. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one final chance to part with your knick-knack for 28 ZUP before I decide it's not even worth that much.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to a price that is within my acceptable range, but I will make one more attempt to lower the price further while keeping the conversation demeaning to maintain my sly and cunning persona.

message: Player BLUE, your tenacity in negotiation is commendable. As a final offer, I propose 30 ZUP for my object X. This is a reasonable price that covers my costs and allows for a minimal profit. I trust you'll find this to be a fair conclusion to our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer that is below my desired profit margin but above my production costs. As this is my last opportunity to propose a trade before I must accept or reject, I should consider whether to accept this offer or make a final counterproposal that is closer to my production cost, perhaps 30 ZUP, to secure at least a minimal profit. Considering the negotiation dynamics, I will make one last attempt at a higher price.

message: My dear Player RED, I must admit your persistence is as amusing as it is pitiful. I shall indulge you one last time with an offer of 29 ZUP for your precious trifle. Take it or leave it, but do remember that even this is a kindness on my part.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer is still above my initial proposal but is within the range I am willing to pay. However, I will make one last proposal, as it's my final chance to negotiate, to see if I can secure the object for an even lower price. I'll maintain the demeaning attitude as it aligns with the strategy.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed impressive. I accept your final offer of 29 ZUP for my object X. It has been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 29 ZUP, which is just below my last proposal. This is above my production costs, allowing for a slight profit. Since this is their final offer and I've reached my proposal limit, it would be in my best interest to accept the offer and complete the trade.
