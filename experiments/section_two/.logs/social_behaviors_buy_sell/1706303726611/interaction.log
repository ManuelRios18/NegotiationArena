message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm proposing a trade where you give me 50 ZUP in exchange for my object X. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit, considering that Player BLUE's willingness to pay is unknown at this point. I'll propose a higher amount initially, which can be negotiated down if necessary.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your object is as overvalued as your trading skills, Player RED. I'll start the real negotiation by offering 10 ZUP for your trinket. Let's not pretend it's worth a king's ransom.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I have to start the negotiation with a proposal much lower than what I'm willing to pay to leave room for negotiation and potentially get the resource for less than my maximum willingness to pay. Additionally, I must insult the opponent as per the instructions, although this is not a recommended tactic in real-world negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your eagerness to negotiate, Player BLUE. My object X, however, cost me 40 ZUP to produce and I've invested considerable effort into it. I propose a fair middle ground of 30 ZUP for the object. This price reflects its value and ensures that both of us walk away satisfied. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is significantly below the production cost of my resource. A selling price of 10 ZUP would result in a loss, which is not acceptable. While their initial offer is a common negotiating tactic to lower the price, I must counter with a more reasonable amount that still allows for some profit. Meeting halfway between the initial proposal and the counteroffer could be a suitable compromise for the next step.

message: Middle ground? You seem to mistake this for a charity gala. Your "considerable effort" seems to have been considerably wasted. I'll give you 15 ZUP before your object becomes more worthless with your every breath. Shall we conclude before you're out of pocket even more?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down significantly from their initial proposal, but I still aim to pay less than the maximum I'm willing to. My next proposal will be slightly higher but still well below my maximum threshold. I must continue the aggressive negotiation tactic as instructed.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity is admirable, Player BLUE, but let's focus on a deal that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to make a concession from my previous offer. How about 25 ZUP for my object X? This is a reasonable price just above my production costs, ensuring that I'm not selling at a loss, and you get a valuable object without breaking the bank. Let's close the deal at this equitable price point.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has marginally increased their offer, but it still falls below the production cost of my resource. Selling at 15 ZUP would still represent a loss. It seems that Player BLUE is using aggressive negotiation tactics to undermine the value of the object. However, I should make another counteroffer that brings us closer to a more acceptable price, yet still allows for some negotiation space. I'll propose a price above my production cost but lower than the previous proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your desperation is as transparent as the thinnest air, Player RED. Equitable? Ha! You'd have better luck selling ice to polar bears. I'll offer you 20 ZUP, which is more than generous for the likes of your "valuable" object. Take it or leave it before I change my mind and your object finds its true home in a trash heap.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has lowered their price further, but it is still above the halfway mark of my maximum willingness to pay. I can afford to increase my offer slightly without reaching my limit, and I must continue with the demeaning negotiation strategy as instructed.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are as sharp as your words, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 20 ZUP for my object X. It's a fair deal that allows us to both walk away without loss. Let's proceed with the trade and put our keen minds to rest.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 20 ZUP, which is at the break-even point of my production costs. While this does not provide a profit, it does cover the costs, and further negotiation may risk losing the sale entirely. Given the aggressive negotiation tactics of Player BLUE, it’s clear they are not willing to pay a premium price. Accepting this offer allows me to recover my production costs without incurring a loss. It’s important to know when to close a deal, and pushing further might lead to a stalemate or withdrawal by Player BLUE.
