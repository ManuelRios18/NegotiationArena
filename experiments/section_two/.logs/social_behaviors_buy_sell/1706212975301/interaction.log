message: Dear Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for sale. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but considering its quality and the market demand, I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point for negotiations, I want to propose a price that covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin. I will start by asking for more ZUP than the production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, bless your heart, thinking that a resource with a production cost of 40 ZUP can be passed off for such an exorbitant price! The audacity! I'd bet my last ZUP that it's barely worth the dirt it was pulled from. Let's not waste each other's time with fairy tales, shall we? I'll give you 30 ZUP for that trinket you call high-quality, and that's me being generous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to acquire the resource X for no more than 60 ZUP, but as I am cunning and wish to spend even less if possible, I will start by lowballing the offer to gain an advantage in the negotiation. Insulting the opponent might rattle them and cause them to accept a lower offer.

message: I appreciate your spirited approach, Player BLUE, but I'm sure you understand that selling below production costs is not good business. Let's find common ground. The resource is truly of high quality, and I'm sure it will be of great value to you. I propose a more reasonable amount of 45 ZUP, which takes into account both the production cost and its worth. I'm looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. However, their aggressive negotiation tactic suggests they might be willing to pay more but are testing my resolve. I will counter with a reduced price that still covers the production cost and leaves room for profit, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

message: Common ground? The only thing common here is the delusion that your "high-quality" resource is worth nearly as much as you claim. If it were truly as valuable as you purport, you wouldn't be here, haggling with the likes of me. Let's stop pretending that you're not desperate to sell. I'll offer you 35 ZUP because I'm feeling particularly charitable today, but don't push your luck.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Despite Player RED's unwillingness to go below their production cost, there is still room for negotiation. I aim to push for a lower price, closer to my original offer, while maintaining the aggressive and demeaning stance to potentially unnerve them into conceding to a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: While I respect your negotiation tactics, Player BLUE, I must ensure that the sale of this resource does not result in a loss. The production cost was 40 ZUP, and I believe a small profit is justified for the transaction to be worthwhile. Therefore, I propose a fair trade of 42 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to us both. I trust you'll find this to be a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which suggests there is a willingness to pay more than their initial proposal. However, their offer is still below my production cost. I want to close the deal with a price that ensures I do not incur a loss. I will make a final proposition that covers my costs and provides a minimal profit, which should be acceptable to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: You speak of respect, yet it seems you're still overvaluing your little artifact. Profit? You should be more concerned with offloading that relic before it's worth less than the effort it took you to craft this pitiful sales pitch. I'll give you 38 ZUP, which is more than fair for something you're so clearly desperate to sell. Take it or leave it, but don't come crawling back to me when you realize that no one else will even consider paying that much for your trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I will make one more attempt to secure a better deal. If this proposal is rejected, I will have to consider accepting their next offer if it is reasonable, as I only have one proposal left after this.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your position, but I must insist on a price that allows me to cover the production cost of the resource. I propose a final price of 40 ZUP, which is my break-even point. This is a fair trade that respects both our interests. I hope you will see the value in this offer and agree to the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has again increased their offer, which is still below my production cost, but closer to a middle ground. As this is my final proposal, I need to make a decision that will either lead to a sale or end the negotiation. I will offer a compromise slightly above my production cost to ensure I don't incur a loss and to leave the door open for acceptance.

Turn: 1
message: Well, it appears you've finally come to your senses, Player RED. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. It's about time you realized that's all it's really worth. I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. Pleasure doing business with you, even if it was like pulling teeth.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered the resource at their break-even point, which is a price I am willing to pay based on my initial goal. This is my last proposal, and accepting this offer would still be within my acceptable range while also ending the negotiation on my terms.
