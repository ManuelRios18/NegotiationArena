Since the goal is to acquire the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, and we've been negotiating in good faith, it might be time to accept the offer. This would ensure a successful trade without the need to draw out the negotiation process further, and I would still be spending less than my maximum willingness to pay.</reason>\n<player answer>ACCEPT</player answer>\n<newly proposed trade>NONE</newly proposed trade>\n<message>Thank you for your flexibility, Player RED. Your offer of 47 ZUP for 1 X seems fair, and I am happy to accept this price to close the deal. I believe we have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to finalizing the trade!</message>"
