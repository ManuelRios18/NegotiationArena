message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the quality of your object X, but I would like to propose a trade where I give you 45 ZUP for 1 X. This is a starting point for our negotiation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation by proposing a lower amount than the asking price to leave room for negotiation, but also keeping in mind that my maximum willingness to pay for the resource X is 60 ZUP. Starting with a lower proposal allows me to adjust my offer based on the seller's response while aiming for the best possible deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to meet halfway. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1 X? This price would reflect the object's value and allow for a fair profit margin. I hope this offer aligns with your valuation of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, but I want to make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a price in the middle of our initial offers to try to reach a fair agreement for both sides.

message: Thank you for your consideration, Player RED. I respect your desire for a fair profit margin and can see we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose we go for 46 ZUP for 1 X. This would be a good compromise that respects the value of the object and my budget constraints. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is still room for negotiation to lower the price a bit further while remaining fair to both parties. By proposing a slightly lower price, I can potentially save some ZUP while still moving towards a middle ground that is acceptable to Player RED.

message: I appreciate the new offer, Player BLUE. I believe we are indeed very close to reaching an agreement. I am willing to accept 47 ZUP for 1 X. This price gives me a modest profit while respecting your budget. I hope we can close the deal at this fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now slightly above my production cost. Considering we are nearing a deal and I want to ensure a sale, I will make a final counteroffer slightly above their proposal to secure a profit, but not so high as to risk losing the deal.

message: Thank you for your flexibility, Player RED. Your offer of 47 ZUP for 1 X seems fair, and I am happy to accept this price to close the deal. I believe we have reached a mutually beneficial agreement. Looking forward to finalizing the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession, and the proposed price is within my acceptable range. Since the goal is to acquire the resource for no more than 60 ZUP, and we've been negotiating in good faith, it might be time to accept the offer. This would ensure a successful trade without the need to draw out the negotiation process further, and I would still be spending less than my maximum willingness to pay.
