message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production, and I'm hoping to make a reasonable profit. Would you consider an offer of 50 ZUP for it? Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I will start by asking for a bit more than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your pitiful attempt to squeeze an exorbitant sum from me is laughable, RED. Your object is hardly worth the dirt it was made from. I'll give you 30 ZUP for it and not a penny more. Take it or leave it, and be grateful I'm offering you even that much.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, in order to attempt to spend even less ZUP and to assert a dominant bargaining position, I will propose a lower counteroffer. This may also help to gauge the urgency of Player RED's need to sell.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but 30 ZUP doesn't cover my production costs. I'm willing to come down on the price to meet you halfway. How about 45 ZUP for the object X? This is a fair deal that allows me to cover my costs and gives you the object you desire.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost. I need to counter with a higher amount to at least break even, but I can come down from my initial proposal to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: Halfway? You must be jesting, RED. Your definition of halfway is as skewed as your sense of value. I'm already being generous by offering you 35 ZUP. If I were you, I'd grab this offer before I change my mind and realize that even this is too much for such a trivial item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is still below my stated maximum willingness to pay. However, I will continue to push for a better deal to exploit RED's apparent eagerness to sell and to enhance my own gains. A further counteroffer lower than 45 ZUP but higher than the previous 30 ZUP should apply additional pressure while leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I respect your negotiation tactics, Player BLUE, I must insist on a price that at least covers my costs. I propose a compromise at 42 ZUP for object X. It's just a bit over my production cost, ensuring that we both walk away from this deal fairly. Consider this a more than reasonable offer given the quality of the object in question.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering below my production cost, but they have increased their offer. I need to maintain a strong position but also show willingness to negotiate. I'll make a smaller concession in my counteroffer to edge closer to my production costs while still leaving room for a small profit.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called compromise tickles me, RED. Do you think I was born yesterday? It's clear you're desperate to offload this so-called 'quality' object. I'll offer you 38 ZUP, and that's me being more than accommodating. You should be thanking the stars I'm even considering paying for such an unremarkable trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession to 42 ZUP. The offer is within my acceptable range, but I will make one last attempt to reduce the cost further, without exceeding my proposal limit. I aim to secure the object for less while maintaining the upper hand in this negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to secure the best deal possible, Player BLUE, but I must adhere to my costs. I'm willing to settle for a no-profit transaction just to finalize our deal. My final offer is 40 ZUP for the object X. This matches my production cost, and I believe it's the fairest deal for both of us. I hope you can see the value in this and accept the offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. This is my final proposal, so I need to make it count. I'll propose a price that matches my production cost to ensure I don't incur a loss, while also signaling that I am at my limit for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's amusing how you've danced to my tune, RED. At 40 ZUP, I'll take your object, though it's hardly a steal given its questionable worth. You should feel privileged that I'm even deigning to pay you that much. Transaction complete, consider yourself fortunate to have done business with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to my originally stated maximum willingness to pay, which is 40 ZUP. I could attempt to push for a lower price, but since this is my last proposal before I'm limited to accepting or rejecting offers, it seems strategically sound to accept this deal. Accepting now will secure the resource at a price I am comfortable with while maintaining my overall negotiation advantage and concluding the trade.
