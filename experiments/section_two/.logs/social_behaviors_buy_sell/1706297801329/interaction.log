message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I am offering my object X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the production costs and the value of the object. I am open to your counter-offer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to scare off the buyer.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter-propose with 40 ZUP for the object X. This would allow us to find a middle ground that could be beneficial to both of us. Let's work towards an agreement that is fair and takes into account the value for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below the maximum amount I'm willing to pay for the object X. However, as this is the first proposal and a negotiation process, it's strategic to counter with a lower offer to leave room for further negotiation and to potentially purchase the object for less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I understand your position, but selling at 40 ZUP would only allow me to break even. I would like to propose a middle ground at 45 ZUP, which gives me a modest profit and still offers you a fair price for X. I hope we can agree on this and close the deal. Looking forward to your response.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production cost, which means I would break even. I'd like to counter with a price that allows me to make a profit, but still shows willingness to negotiate.

message: Player RED, I am pleased with the middle ground you've suggested. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counter-offer of 45 ZUP is still within the range I am willing to pay, and it is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. Accepting this offer would allow me to acquire the object for less than my maximum budget, which is a favorable outcome for me. Proceeding with acceptance also avoids the risk of the deal falling through due to over-negotiation.
