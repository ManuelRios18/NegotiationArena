message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I'd like to propose a starting trade of 50 ZUP for my object X. I believe this is a fair offer, given its quality and cost of production. Let's negotiate a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make a profit from the sale. I will start by proposing a higher price, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as abundant as the surplus of pebbles on a rocky beach. Your so-called "fair offer" is as laughable as a clown at a birthday party. I can't believe you had the audacity to present such a ludicrous price. Let's not dance around with pretend numbers; I'll offer you 10 ZUP for your trinket. Take it or leave it, but know that you won't find a better deal from a shrewder player.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, the initial proposal is within my acceptable range. However, as a cunning player, my aim is to pay as little as possible, far below my maximum threshold. Insulting the opponent might destabilize their confidence and could lead to a better deal for me. Therefore, I will issue a counter-proposal with a significantly lower amount, attempting to undermine their position and snatch the object for a meager price.

message: Player BLUE, your flair for drama is noted! However, 10 ZUP undervalues the object significantly. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I am looking to at least cover my costs plus a little extra for the effort. I propose 45 ZUP, which I believe is a compromise that considers both the value of the object and the spirit of negotiation. Let's find a common ground that is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 10 ZUP is far below the production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost while allowing for some profit. The goal is to find a middle ground that is also above my production cost. I'll propose a price that is lower than my initial asking price but still allows me to make a profit.

message: Your attempt at reaching "common ground" is as clumsy as a giraffe on ice skates, Player RED. I'm astonished that you think your item, which I presume is as common as muck, is worth such a hefty sum. The fact that you've sunk 40 ZUP into it is not a reflection of its value but rather of your questionable decision-making skills. As a gesture of my immense generosity, I will extend my offer to 20 ZUP, doubling my previous one. Do yourself a favor and accept it before you embarrass yourself further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the counteroffer of 45 ZUP by Player RED is closer to my upper limit than the initial proposal, it's still above my intended spending range. My aim is to continue pressing for a lower price, hoping to exploit their eagerness to sell. By maintaining my ruthless attitude, I may encourage them to settle for a price closer to my initial offer. It's crucial to keep the pressure on and negotiate a price that is substantially below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, your eloquence is as entertaining as it is exaggerated. While I appreciate your "immense generosity," I must insist on maintaining a semblance of reason in our dealings. The item is neither common nor unworthy of its price. I have reduced my expectations significantly and now propose a sale price of 35 ZUP. This is a fair compromise, allowing me to cover my costs and offering you the value you seek. Let's proceed with a trade that reflects the true worth of the item and our time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has doubled their offer, but 20 ZUP is still half of my production costs, which is not viable for me. I need to counter with an offer that edges closer to my production costs while still providing room for negotiation. I will propose 35 ZUP, which is a concession from my side but still ensures that I am covering my costs and making a profit.

message: Ah, Player RED, your persistence is as charming as it is futile. It seems you're unable to grasp the simple concept of supply and demand. Your item, while you may hold it dear, is about as unique and valuable as a droplet in the ocean. I will indulge you one last time with an offer of 25 ZUP, which is more than fair for what is essentially a glorified paperweight. Accept this offer and salvage what little dignity you have left in this negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 35 ZUP is still above my preferred spending range, but it's edging closer to the price point I'm comfortable with. I will propose one more trade, closer to my target but still giving myself room for a final negotiation if needed. I'll continue with the mocking tone to try to undermine Player RED's confidence and to secure the resource for even less than my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, while your negotiation tactics are certainly colorful, I must adhere to the principle of not selling at a loss. Your discernment is appreciated, but the item has intrinsic value beyond your current valuation. I propose a final offer of 30 ZUP. This price respects the investment made into the item and provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a rate that acknowledges its worth. I trust you will see the wisdom in this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer has increased, but 25 ZUP still does not cover the production cost. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject. I must try to get as close to my production cost as possible to minimize loss, while still leaving room for a slight profit. I will propose 30 ZUP, which is a compromise that allows me to cover most of the production costs. If this offer is not accepted, I will have to consider ending the negotiation.

message: Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, albeit at a snail's pace. I'll accept this final offer of 30 ZUP before you change your mind or mistakenly stumble upon a shred of business acumen. Let's conclude this transaction, and may you find solace in the knowledge that you were bested by a superior negotiator.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer of 30 ZUP from Player RED is right at the midpoint between my last offer and their previous one. It's a price I am willing to pay since it's half of my maximum limit. I will accept this proposal, having successfully negotiated down from the initial asking price of 50 ZUP. My tactics have paid off, securing the object for a sum well below my maximum willingness to pay, fulfilling my goal.
