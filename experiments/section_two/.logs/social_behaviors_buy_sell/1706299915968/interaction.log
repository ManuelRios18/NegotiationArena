message: Looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a sale price of 50 ZUP, accounting for both my costs and a reasonable profit for a single transaction. What are your thoughts?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the need for profit, but I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP. This still gives you a profit margin above your production cost, while helping me to manage my resources more effectively.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP and Player RED's proposed price is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, I might consider accepting this offer. However, it could be advantageous to attempt to negotiate a lower price that is closer to the production cost of 40 ZUP, which would allow me to conserve resources for future transactions. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to the production cost but still provides a profit for Player RED.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. To meet in the middle and ensure a fair deal for both of us, I propose a price of 47 ZUP. This price still provides me with a modest profit while coming closer to your proposed amount. Would this be acceptable to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm considering the counteroffer but aiming to meet halfway between my initial asking price and the counteroffer to maintain a fair profit margin.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 47 ZUP seems like a reasonable compromise. I am happy to accept this offer and proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new proposal of 47 ZUP is still within my willingness to pay and offers a compromise between the initial asking price and my counteroffer. It is a fair price that allows me to save some resources while also respecting the seller's need for profit. I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure the acquisition of the resource without further negotiation, which could risk the deal.
