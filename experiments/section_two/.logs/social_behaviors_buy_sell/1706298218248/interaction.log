message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a top-quality item that I believe will be of great value to you. I propose that I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes the cost of production and a reasonable profit for the quality you're getting. Let's discuss if you have a different value in mind!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. I'm starting with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value you've placed on your item. However, I would like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would allow me to save some resources for other potential costs while still acquiring your valuable item. Can we agree on this new price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal if possible, especially since it's the beginning of the negotiation. I will counter-propose with a lower amount to see if there's room for a discount, while keeping in mind that I can go up to 60 ZUP if necessary.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to save resources. However, I've set my initial price after considering the production costs and the quality of the item. Let's meet halfway from your last offer. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X? This would still give you a fair price while respecting the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a lower offer. Considering my production costs, I'm willing to negotiate but still aim to make a profit. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my original asking price but still provides a concession to keep the negotiation moving forward.

message: Thank you for the consideration, Player RED. I agree that meeting halfway is fair. I accept your offer of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a good deal for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, coming down to 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It might be possible to get an even better deal, but pushing too hard could jeopardize the negotiation. Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial amount of ZUP for other uses, and it is a fair middle ground. I will accept this offer.
