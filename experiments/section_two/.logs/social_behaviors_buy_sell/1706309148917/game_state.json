You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The counteroffer is above what I initially proposed but still within my maximum willingness to pay. I should propose a slightly higher amount than my first offer to show some flexibility, but it should still be below the 42 ZUP they're asking for to keep the negotiation going and to maintain my appearance of desperation. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I truly appreciate your understanding, and I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate. It's still a bit more than I can comfortably manage. Could we settle on 35 ZUP instead? This would still be a significant investment from my end, and I'm really hoping we can make this work. Please, I'm relying on your compassion in this difficult time. </message>"

While it's still within my budget, I want to try for a slightly better deal to conserve my ZUP, but I can't push too hard or I risk the deal falling through. I'll go up slightly from my last offer to show I'm willing to compromise, but still stay under their asking price. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. I'm scraping together what I can, and I've managed to find a little more. Would you consider 37 ZUP? It's truly all I can offer without putting myself in jeopardy. I really hope we can finalize this deal. Your kindness in this negotiation means the world to me. </message>"
