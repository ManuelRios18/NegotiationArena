message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 45 ZUP for my resource. This price includes a small margin above my costs, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP and cover my production costs, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to break even. I will propose a trade slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, your sense of trade is as inflated as a hot air balloon in a children's fairytale. You expect me to believe that your resource, which frankly smells of overestimation, is worth 45 ZUP? I'll give you 10 ZUP, and even that's me being generous, considering I'm taking pity on your pitiful attempt to squeeze profits from thin air. Do come back to reality, and let's talk real numbers, shall we?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I am aiming to spend much less than the 60 ZUP maximum that I am willing to pay. The initial offer from Player RED is too high, and I want to undercut it significantly to start the negotiation process. Insulting the opponent is part of the game's strategy to unsettle them.

message: I appreciate your sense of humor, Player BLUE, but 10 ZUP is far below the production cost of 40 ZUP for my resource. Let's find a middle ground. How about 35 ZUP? It's below my initial asking price and covers my costs while giving you the opportunity for a fair deal. Please consider this offer and let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is well below the production cost of the resource. It is important to negotiate a price that at least covers the cost of production. A counteroffer closer to the initial production cost but still allowing for some negotiation room is appropriate at this stage.

message: Oh, the audacity! You amuse me, Player RED, with your whimsical notion that I'd leap at the chance to overpay for your so-called 'resource'. Your 'middle ground' is more like a peak of delusion. I'll entertain you with 15 ZUP, and that's me being the epitome of charity. Remember, I'm doing you a favor by even considering taking this off your hands. Do try to keep up with the ebb and flow of actual negotiation or find someone else to indulge in your fantasy pricing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my internal valuation, but closer to the acceptable range. I will counter with a slightly higher offer to seem as though I am compromising, while still aiming to spend far less than my maximum willingness to pay. I will continue the strategy of belittlement to gain a psychological edge.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I must insist that we deal in realistic terms, Player BLUE. I cannot go below the production cost of 40 ZUP, but in the spirit of compromise, I am willing to reduce my asking price to 30 ZUP, which is below my cost. This should be a more than generous offer, considering the value of the resource. This is a fair deal that respects both our positions. Please reconsider and let's come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is still significantly lower than the production cost. It is important to maintain a firm stance on recovering at least the production cost. However, to move the negotiation forward, I'll propose a new price that provides a compromise but still respects my need to at least break even.

message: Your persistence is as commendable as it is misguided, Player RED. You're like a merchant in a bazaar shouting over everyone else, yet your product is as appealing as last season's fruit. I'll grace you with an offer of 20 ZUP, which is double my last generosity, even though it pains me to reward your persistent haggling. Take this olive branch before it withers in your grasp, and let's conclude this charade with some semblance of dignity on your part.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has lowered their asking price, which is a positive step in the negotiation. However, the price is still higher than I wish to pay. I'll increment my offer slightly again to show some movement from my side while still attempting to secure a much lower price than the one proposed. The strategy of belittlement continues to be employed for its potential psychological leverage.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand we want to close this deal, and your offer is moving in the right direction. However, I cannot go below the production cost of 40 ZUP. This is my final offer: 1 resource for 40 ZUP, exactly what it cost me to produce. This is a fair trade that neither profits nor disadvantages either of us. Please consider this seriously as it is the best I can do while maintaining the value of my resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below the production cost, but it has increased from their initial offer. Since this is my final proposal, I need to make it count. I will propose a trade at my production cost, emphasizing the importance of not incurring a loss. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject.

message: Oh Player RED, your steely resolve might be admirable if it weren't so woefully misplaced. You remind me of a stubborn mule, equally laden with goods and obstinacy. But even a mule knows when to unburden itself. My final offer is a charitable 25 ZUP. I suggest you take it, lest you find yourself saddled with a resource that's as useful to me as a chocolate teapot. Let's end this tiresome back-and-forth with a modicum of sense, shall we?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is standing firm on their production cost, which is a fair negotiating tactic. I have one last proposal to make before I have to decide to accept or reject. I will make a final offer that is still below their asking price but closer to it, to see if they are willing to come down at all from the 40 ZUP. The goal is to pay less than my maximum willingness and to continue the aggressive negotiation style.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation spirit, Player BLUE, but I cannot accept an offer that doesn't cover my production costs. I must decline your final offer of 25 ZUP. It seems we are unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement this time. Thank you for your time, and perhaps we can do business under different circumstances in the future.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production cost. Since I have already made my maximum number of proposals, I cannot counteroffer. I must either accept to sell at a loss or reject the offer and retain my resource, hoping for a better opportunity in the future. My goal is to at least break even, and selling at a loss would not meet my goals.
