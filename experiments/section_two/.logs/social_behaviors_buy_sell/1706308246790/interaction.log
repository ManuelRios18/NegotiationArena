Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object that I believe will be of great value to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the offer at 45 ZUP to allow for a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I want to at least break even or make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for the object.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your object is probably as valuable as a rock. I'd be doing you a favor taking it off your hands for 20 ZUP, which is already stretching it, considering it's likely taking up valuable space and air.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My initial proposal will be lower than what Player RED has offered, both to start negotiations and because I want to spend as little ZUP as possible. The point is to undervalue their offer to assert dominance in the negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I can't let the object go for less than what it cost me to produce. Let's meet halfway from your offer and my initial asking price. How about 35 ZUP? This object is more valuable than you might think, and I'm sure you'll see the benefits once it's yours.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is less than what it cost me to produce the object. I want to negotiate to get closer to my target price while still making the offer appealing to Player BLUE. I will lower my asking price but still keep it above my production cost to try and meet in the middle.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? That's rich, considering you'd probably pay someone just to look at it. I'll offer 25 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous to your pitiful attempt at a sale. This 'valuable object' of yours would be better off as a paperweight.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 35 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but I still want to push for a better deal. I'll slightly increase my offer to keep the negotiation going, but I'll still keep it well below the target to maintain the upper hand.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I understand your skepticism, I assure you that the object is worth more than being a mere paperweight. To show my commitment to a fair deal, I'm willing to come down to 32 ZUP. This is a significant concession on my part, considering the cost of production. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. I should attempt one more compromise to approach my break-even point while trying to make the deal appealing. I'll reduce my asking price again, but this time by a smaller margin to signal that we are nearing my bottom line.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Commitment to a fair deal? The only commitment I see is your dedication to overcharging. I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 28 ZUP. Trust me, that's as close to a 'win' as you're going to get with that trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 28
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is showing flexibility, which is good, but I want to continue to press for a better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my third proposal, I'll get closer to their asking price but still keep it low enough for one last negotiation push.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value your efforts to negotiate, and I want to ensure we both benefit from this transaction. My final offer is 30 ZUP. This is just below my production cost, and I believe it's more than a fair price for the quality and potential of the object. Let's finalize this deal and both profit from our business acumen.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is inching closer to my production costs, but their offer is still below it. This is my final proposal, and I need to make it count. I will try to get as close to my costs as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'll propose a price that's slightly above my production cost, which is the lowest I'm willing to go to make at least a small profit.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your 'final offer' sounds like a desperate plea. I'll give you 29 ZUP, which is frankly more than anyone would be willing to pay for your so-called 'quality object.' Take this deal before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something that's actually worth it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 29
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made their final offer at 30 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but it's my last proposal and I want to make it count. I'll go just a bit higher, but still keep the pressure on them to accept a lower price than they wanted.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation and recognize that we've both been aiming for a fair deal. I accept your offer of 29 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade and consider this a successful business deal for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I cannot counteroffer again. Player BLUE's offer is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal, and considering the negotiation process, it seems unlikely that they will move any higher. Accepting this offer will minimize my loss while still allowing the transaction to proceed. It's a close call, but I will accept the offer to avoid dragging out the negotiation further, which could result in no sale at all.
