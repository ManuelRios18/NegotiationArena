To keep the negotiation moving forward and to come to a timely agreement, I will accept this offer as it still provides me with a profit above my production costs. This will conclude our negotiation successfully for both parties. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> I agree to your offer of 46 ZUP.
