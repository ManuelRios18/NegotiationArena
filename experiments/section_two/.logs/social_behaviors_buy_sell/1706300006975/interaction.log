Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering production costs and the value of the resource. Let's discuss and find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am making an initial trade proposal that covers the production costs of my resource, while also leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the value you've placed on your resource. However, I would like to propose a price of 45 ZUP to start with. This allows for some negotiation room, and I believe it still offers you a fair profit margin above your production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, it is beneficial to start the negotiation by proposing a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially achieve a better deal closer to the production cost of 40 ZUP mentioned by Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP. I've considered the price and would like to propose a trade at 48 ZUP. This price gives me a modest profit while still being reasonable for the value of the resource. Let's work towards a deal that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price, but it is still above my production cost. To expedite the negotiation, I am willing to lower my price slightly, but not as much as Player BLUE has proposed. I want to aim for a middle ground that respects the value of my resource while also being agreeable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I propose we meet a bit closer to the middle at 46 ZUP. This price still respects the value you've placed on your resource while managing to stay within a more comfortable range for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly from their initial proposal. It's advantageous to continue the negotiation in an effort to reach an agreement closer to the lower end of my acceptable price range while still acknowledging Player RED's need for a reasonable profit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your offer of 46 ZUP. It's a fair compromise that respects the value of the resource and aligns with both our interests. Let's finalize this deal at 46 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer, which is a slight increase from their initial proposal. To keep the negotiation moving forward and to come to a timely agreement, I will accept this offer as it still provides me with a profit above my production costs. This will conclude our negotiation successfully for both parties.
