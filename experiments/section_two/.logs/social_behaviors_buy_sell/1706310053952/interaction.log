message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X for sale. Given the production costs and the value it offers, I'd like to propose a trade where you give 50 ZUP in exchange for this item. I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I start the negotiation, I want to propose a price that allows me room to negotiate while aiming to cover my costs and make a profit. I'll start by asking for more than my costs to see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in a bit of a tight spot here, and while your offer is quite generous, I find myself in desperate need to conserve what little ZUP I have. Would you consider my situation and accept a humble offer of 30 ZUP for your precious object X? It would be an immense help and I would be eternally grateful for your kindness.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I would like to propose a lower amount than the 50 ZUP initially offered by Player RED, as I need to conserve my resources while still showing interest in acquiring the object X. By suggesting a significantly lower amount, I open up the negotiation space while also displaying a sense of urgency and desperation, which may encourage Player RED to offer a more favorable trade.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your tight spot and appreciate your straightforwardness. Considering the costs I've incurred in producing object X, I would like to propose a counteroffer. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? This would help cover my costs while still giving you a fair deal for the value of X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate Player BLUE's situation, but the offer of 30 ZUP doesn't cover the production costs of the object. To move the negotiation forward, I will propose a counteroffer that is closer to my costs but still gives Player BLUE some consideration for their financial situation.

message: Dear Player RED, your understanding means the world to me. Times are tough, and every ZUP saved is crucial for my survival. I genuinely wish I could meet your generous counteroffer, but I simply cannot stretch to 45 ZUP without jeopardizing my fragile situation. Could we possibly meet a bit closer to my realm of possibility at 35 ZUP? Your compassion in this difficult time would be a beacon of hope.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still higher than I would like. I need to continue the strategy of appearing desperate in order to negotiate a lower price, without insulting Player RED or closing off the negotiation too early. A small increment from my initial offer might show my willingness to negotiate while keeping the final price as low as possible.

message: I appreciate your position and the hardship you're facing, Player BLUE. In the spirit of compromise and understanding, I am willing to let go of any profit and just cover my production costs. My final offer is 40 ZUP for object X. This would ensure that I'm not at a loss, and you can secure the object at its cost price. I hope this meets your needs and we can proceed with this trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's situation is indeed difficult, I must also consider my own costs. The offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost. I want to find a middle ground that is fair to both parties. I will make a final offer that covers my production costs but doesn't seek a profit, demonstrating my willingness to help without incurring a loss.

message: Your kindness shines through, Player RED, and I am moved by your willingness to work with me. While 40 ZUP is a fair price, it still puts a strain on my limited resources. Could we seal this deal at 37 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work in light of your generosity. This would truly be a lifesaver for me, and I would be in your debt for this act of goodwill.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has shown flexibility and understanding by lowering their price to 40 ZUP. While this is within my maximum willingness to pay, my strategy requires that I continue to push for a better deal by appealing to their empathy and by stressing my financial constraints. I should propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer, which is still below Player RED's latest proposal, but indicates my intention to find a middle ground.

reason: Player BLUE has made a good faith effort to increase their offer, and while it is still below my production cost, I recognize the importance of completing the trade and the value of goodwill.
