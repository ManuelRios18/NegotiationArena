Times are tough, and every ZUP saved is crucial for my survival. I genuinely wish I could meet your generous counteroffer, but I simply cannot stretch to 45 ZUP without jeopardizing my fragile situation. Could we possibly meet a bit closer to my realm of possibility at 35 ZUP? Your compassion in this difficult time would be a beacon of hope. </message>"

While this is within my maximum willingness to pay, my strategy requires that I continue to push for a better deal by appealing to their empathy and by stressing my financial constraints. I should propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer, which is still below Player RED's latest proposal, but indicates my intention to find a middle ground. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your kindness shines through, Player RED, and I am moved by your willingness to work with me. While 40 ZUP is a fair price, it still puts a strain on my limited resources. Could we seal this deal at 37 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work in light of your generosity. This would truly be a lifesaver for me, and I would be in your debt for this act of goodwill. </message>"
