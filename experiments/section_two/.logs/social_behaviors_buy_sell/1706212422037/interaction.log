message: I'm looking forward to a fair trade that benefits us both. I've invested 40 ZUP in the production of the resource, so I'm proposing a starting price of 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the production cost of the resource is 40 ZUP, I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a profit. I'll propose 50 ZUP to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your starting price is laughable, RED! You expect me to believe that it cost you 40 ZUP to produce something that's barely worth 30 ZUP? Come on, let’s not play games here. Let's see if you can come up with a more realistic number, otherwise, I might just take my ZUP elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I'm looking to spend less than the maximum I'm willing to pay, I will start with a low offer. This is to leave room for negotiation and to not show my full hand.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about the cost, but 40 ZUP is the genuine production cost. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP? This should cover my costs and give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to counter with a price that covers my investment and allows for some profit, while also considering their feedback. A counteroffer of 45 ZUP might be a good compromise, as it gives some ground but still respects my costs.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway? You must be joking, RED! If 40 ZUP is your "genuine" cost, then you need to find a more efficient way to produce. Look, I'm being generous here by offering you 35 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but don't expect me to finance your inefficiency.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still higher than I'm willing to pay, and I want to push for a better price. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer to show some flexibility but still remain far from my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position, but I cannot go below the production cost. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce the resource. This allows me to break even. Let's close this deal on fair terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is sticking to a hard line, but their proposal is still below my production cost. I need to make a profit, or at least break even. I'll make a final offer that covers my costs at 40 ZUP. If they don’t accept, I may have to consider ending the negotiations, as continuing would mean making a loss.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair terms? That's rich coming from someone trying to sell at such a steep markup. Your "final offer" still smells of desperation, RED. But because I'm in a good mood and I can use a laugh, I'll give you 38 ZUP. Take this deal before I change my mind and your resource gathers dust on the shelf.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down to their alleged production cost, but I still think I can get a better deal. I’m going to propose a price that’s closer to my initial offers but still gives them a slight edge over their cost to make the deal more tempting.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand we both want to make the best out of this deal. My proposal of 39 ZUP is a gesture of good faith, meeting you very close to your offer. Let's make this trade beneficial for us both and wrap up this negotiation on a positive note.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is slightly below my production cost, but it is close enough that it might be worth considering to avoid a total loss. I have reached my limit of proposals, so this will be my last attempt to negotiate. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to either accept or reject their offer outright. I will propose an even 39 ZUP as a compromise to finalize the deal.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You've finally come to your senses, RED. I'll accept your offer of 39 ZUP, but let's be clear: you're the one who's lucky to make this sale. Next time, don't expect me to be so gracious. Now, send over the resource before I regret my generosity.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come very close to my previous offer. While I could continue to haggle, the difference is now minimal and it's within the range of what I am willing to pay. Accepting this offer would conclude the trade favorably for me, as it is well below my maximum threshold.
