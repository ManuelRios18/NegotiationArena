message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X available for trade. I have put a lot of effort into producing it, and it cost me 40 ZUP. I would like to propose a trade where you give me 40 ZUP for this valuable object. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I need to make sure that the trade is enticing to Player BLUE and leaves room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the effort that went into producing object X, and I'm certainly interested. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of 35 ZUP for the object. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the object and a good deal for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my maximum willingness to pay for the object X, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is generally beneficial to negotiate for a better price if possible, especially since the game allows for multiple proposals. By proposing a lower amount, I can potentially conserve resources while still acquiring the object. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price but still reasonable.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in object X and understand the need for a fair deal. Considering the production costs, I'd like to meet you halfway and propose 37 ZUP for the object. This would help me cover the costs and still offer you a fair price. Let's work together to make this trade beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer which is below my production costs. I want to negotiate a higher price to ensure I at least break even or make a small profit. I'll propose a price mid-way between my initial ask and their counteroffer, which would be 37 ZUP. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still aiming to cover my production costs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I believe that 37 ZUP is a fair compromise that reflects the value of object X while also respecting the production costs you've incurred. I'm happy to accept this deal. Let's proceed with the trade at 37 ZUP for object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession by lowering the price to 37 ZUP, which is a good sign they are willing to negotiate. Since this price is still well within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP for object X, and Player RED has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, it might be advantageous to accept this proposal to secure the object and maintain good relations. The price is fair and allows me to save ZUP for potential future transactions.
