message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I would like to propose a starting trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my objective is to sell my resource for ZUP, ideally at a price that allows me to recover the production cost of 40 ZUP or more to ensure profit. I will start with proposing a slightly higher amount to open room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I am interested in acquiring object X, but I'd like to propose a revised trade where I give you 45 ZUP for it. Let me know if this works for you or if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within my budget of 60 ZUP. However, it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal if possible to preserve more of my resources for potential future uses. I will propose a slightly lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand the need to cover production costs. To further this negotiation, I propose giving you 46 ZUP for object X. I hope this revised offer works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my budget. It's closer to my initial offer than their starting point, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I believe there might still be room for slight negotiation to lower the cost. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if we can finalize the deal at a better rate for me.
