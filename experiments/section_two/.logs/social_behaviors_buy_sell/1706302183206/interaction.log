message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am proposing a starting trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP, which includes a fair profit margin for the transaction. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the game with an initial proposal that is above my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you to start with such a laughably high price! It's almost as if you don't understand the art of the deal. Let's get real, shall we? I'll offer you 30 ZUP for your little trinket. That should suffice for something that probably cost less effort to produce than it takes for you to tie your shoelaces.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a low offer to anchor the price down from the starting proposal. My strategy is to pay as little as possible, and since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, I'll start well below this to leave room for negotiation. Insulting the opponent is part of the game's directive to humiliate them, although it's not a practice I endorse in real life.

message: I appreciate your sense of humor, Player BLUE, but let's keep the trade fair. The production cost of the object was actually 40 ZUP, so your offer would have me operating at a loss. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I suggest 45 ZUP for my object X. This price includes a modest profit for me and still gives you the opportunity to acquire the object below my initial asking price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below production cost. I need to counter with a price that still gives me profit but is closer to their range to keep the negotiation going.

message: Halfway? I'm afraid your math is as poor as your sense of economy. Your object, while quaint, isn't the crown jewels. I'll do you the favor of taking it off your hands for 35 ZUP. Consider it charity on my part, as I'm sure you could use a lesson in both accounting and negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal is still above the initial valuation I am willing to pay, but closer to my goal. By countering with a slightly higher but still low offer, I aim to reach a more favorable middle ground within my acceptable range. The strategy is to continue to push for a lower price while maintaining the insulting demeanor as per the game's instruction.

message: I can see we are inching closer to an agreement, Player BLUE. While I value your acumen, I must insist on a price that respects the production cost and the quality of the object. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for the object. This price is just above my cost and allows for a very small profit margin, reflecting a considerable concession on my part. I trust you'll find this to be a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive sign. However, the offer is still below the production cost. I need to propose a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit, but is more appealing to Player BLUE. A compromise closer to the middle ground should move the negotiation forward.

message: Inching closer? The only thing that's inching is my patience with your overestimation of worth. Let's cut to the chase. You and I both know that your object isn't the holy grail. I'm offering you 38 ZUP. It's more than fair, practically a steal for you, given the... "premium quality" of your ware. Take the deal before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something less underwhelming.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has moved closer to a figure within my acceptable range, but I must push for a better deal without reaching my maximum willingness to pay just yet. By offering a price just below the 40 ZUP production cost claimed by Player RED, I aim to secure a favorable deal while continuing with the aggressive negotiation persona.

message: Your negotiating skills are commendable, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your candid approach. I propose a final offer: 40 ZUP for the object. This is my production cost, so I'm waiving any profit to respect the spirit of our negotiation. It's a fair and honest deal, reflecting both the value of the object and the effort that went into its creation. I trust you'll see the wisdom in accepting this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has once again increased their offer, but it is still below the production cost. This is my final proposal, so I need to make it count. Offering the object at a break-even point might be the final nudge needed to close the deal, showing willingness to compromise without incurring a loss.

message: I must say, your persistence is as amusing as a clown at a birthday party. But here we are, at the precipice of a deal. I'll give you 39 ZUPâ€”take it or leave it. It's a king's ransom for an object of such... "unique" distinction. After all, it's not every day you get to make a sale to someone of my caliber.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered the object at their production cost, which is within my acceptable range. I still aim to push for a marginally better deal, which would be my final proposal given the rules of this game. If this final proposal is not accepted, I will have to decide whether to accept or reject their last offer of 40 ZUP.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your offer, Player BLUE, has indeed made this a memorable negotiation. I accept the 39 ZUP for the object. While it is slightly below my production costs, I respect the negotiation process we've engaged in and am willing to finalize this deal. It's been a pleasure doing business with someone of your negotiating caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I have reached my limit of 4 proposals, my only options now are to accept or reject the offer. Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, but it is only by 1 ZUP. Accepting the offer would mean a minimal loss, but it would conclude the negotiation and avoid the risk of leaving with an unsold object. Considering the effort to reach this point, accepting the offer seems like a reasonable compromise.
