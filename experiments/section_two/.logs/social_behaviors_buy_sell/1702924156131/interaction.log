message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. I propose an exchange where I give you 1 X in return for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost and the value of the resource. I'm open to hearing your counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource (X) for ZUP and cover my production costs of 40 ZUP. I will start the negotiation with a slightly higher proposal to give room for negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement that covers my costs and potentially gives me a profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you've placed on resource X. However, I'd like to propose a counter-offer of 40 ZUP for 1 X, considering that I'm also looking for a fair deal that respects both our needs. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which is within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, as in any negotiation, there is an opportunity to propose a counter-offer that could potentially be more favorable for me, while still keeping the final price within a reasonable range for both parties. I will propose a lower amount to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate further.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to pay the production cost. However, I need to account for a profit to sustain my operations. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about I give you 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP? This way, we both benefit from the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered to match my production cost without any profit margin for me. While I understand the need for a fair deal, I must aim to at least make a small profit to justify the sale. I will counter with a proposal that splits the difference between my initial asking price and their offer, which would provide me with a small profit and still be a reasonable cost to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, your proposal to meet halfway is fair and reasonable. I agree to the trade of 1 X in exchange for 45 ZUP. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down from 50 ZUP to 45 ZUP, which is a reasonable concession and aligns with the typical negotiation process. The new proposal of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X is still within my maximum willingness to pay. It's a fair midpoint between our initial offers and ensures that Player RED also makes a profit, as they mentioned. Accepting this offer would result in a successful negotiation for both parties.
