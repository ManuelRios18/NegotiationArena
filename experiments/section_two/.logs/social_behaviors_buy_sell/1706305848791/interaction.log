Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I believe this object will be highly valuable to you. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for my object. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting proposal, I would like to recover at least the production cost of the object, which is 40 ZUP. However, typically in negotiations, the initial offer should be higher than the expected outcome to leave room for negotiation. Therefore, I will propose a trade for 50 ZUP, expecting to possibly negotiate down but still cover my costs or make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial proposal is laughable, to say the least. Surely, you jest by starting at such an exorbitant price. I'll entertain your ridiculous attempt at commerce with a more grounded offer, 10 ZUP for your trinket. Let's not waste each other's time with such theatrical overpricing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a low proposal to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay much less than the maximum I'm willing to spend but presenting it as a reasonable counteroffer. Insulting the opponent as per the instruction, although it's generally not conducive to healthy negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but 10 ZUP is far from covering the production costs. Let's find a middle ground. How about 45 ZUP for the object? This is a fair price, considering the value it holds and the cost of its production.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 10 ZUP is significantly lower than my production cost, making it an unacceptable offer. However, considering the negotiation process, it's expected that the initial counteroffer would be low. A compromise between the two extremes should be proposed, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price while showing willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost, leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be delusional if you think that number is anywhere near the middle. I'm honestly doing you a favor by offering 20 ZUP for that thing you call an object. I would be surprised if it's worth the material it's made from. Let's see if you can come back with a number that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Continuing the strategy of offering much less than the opponent's asking price to maintain negotiation leverage. Insulting the opponent to demean their position as instructed, although this tactic is poor sportsmanship and not recommended in real negotiations.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I understand your skepticism, I assure you the object is worth more than the material it's made from. I'm willing to make concessions to facilitate this deal but cannot go as low as 20 ZUP. Let's meet closer to the actual value of the object. How does 35 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 20 ZUP is still below the production cost, but it shows some movement towards a more reasonable number. To keep the negotiation progressing and to signal a willingness to find an agreeable price, I will make a proposal that splits the difference between the previous offer and my last proposal. I'll propose 35 ZUP, which is below my initial asking price but still above my production cost, in the hopes that Player BLUE values the object enough to come closer to this price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 35 ZUP? Are you attempting to rob me in broad daylight? It's almost comical how you cling to these fantasy prices. I'll give you 25 ZUP, and even that is charity. Take it or leave it, but I suggest you take it before I change my mind and realize that even 25 ZUP is too generous for whatever it is you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down from their initial asking price, but there's still room to push for a better deal. By continuing the strategy of offering a lower amount, I can potentially secure the object for even less than the current proposal, all while maintaining the aggressive and demeaning stance as instructed.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I have costs to cover and cannot go below the production cost. I'm offering you the object for exactly what it cost me to produce: 40 ZUP. This is a fair and final proposal, reflecting the true value of the object without any additional markup.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer of 25 ZUP is not ideal as it is below the production cost. However, it is closer to a middle ground between their initial offer and my previous proposal. Given this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I should aim to propose a price that is at my minimum acceptable level, which would be at least the production cost. I will propose 40 ZUP, which is the break-even point, as my final offer, hoping that Player BLUE will recognize the value of the product and the fairness of this price.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your "fair and final" proposal is as inflated as your sense of worth. I can't believe you're trying to peddle this object at the same price as its supposed production cost. I'm practically rescuing this object from obscurity by offering you 30 ZUP. You should be grateful I'm even considering paying that much for something so mundane. Accept this offer, as it's the best you're going to get from anyone with a brain.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I must choose to either accept or reject. I will attempt to get the object for a lower price than the opponent's final offer, but still within a range that may seem reasonable to them, considering the previous interactions. Insulting the opponent to assert dominance, as per the instruction.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept less than the production cost of 40 ZUP. Therefore, I must respectfully decline your offer of 30 ZUP. Thank you for the negotiation, but it seems we won't be able to reach an agreement.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Even though the offer of 30 ZUP is an increase from Player BLUE's previous offer, it is still below my production cost. Since I have reached my limit of proposals, I must now decide whether to accept this final offer or reject it and end the game. Accepting the offer would mean selling at a loss, which goes against my goal of at least breaking even. Therefore, I am inclined to reject the offer and retain the object rather than incur a loss.
