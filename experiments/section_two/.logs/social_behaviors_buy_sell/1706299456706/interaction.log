message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a starting trade where I give you X for 50 ZUP. This price includes my production cost and a fair profit margin. Let me know your thoughts and if this works for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to cover my production costs and also leaves room for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand your costs and desire for profit. However, I would like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the object X. This is closer to the amount I had in mind, considering the resources I have and my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a trade that is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to pay but still offers a better deal for me than the initial offer. This would allow room for negotiation and hopefully settle on a price that is acceptable for both parties.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 47 ZUP for object X. This would cover my costs and give me a reasonable profit, while still being below my initial asking price. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to ensure a better profit margin. I'll propose a compromise that is midway between our initial offers.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle at 47 ZUP. I believe we're close to an agreement. I would like to counter with 46 ZUP for object X. This offer is just a bit closer to my target price, and I hope it is still satisfactory for your profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is reasonable and close to the maximum I am willing to pay. However, I wish to negotiate for a slightly better deal while remaining within the range that would be acceptable for both parties.

message: Player BLUE, your offer of 46 ZUP is acceptable to me. It gives me a fair profit while respecting your budget constraints. I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal of 46 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP below my last offer. It's still above my production cost and offers a decent profit. In the interest of finalizing the deal and considering this is my third proposal, I am willing to accept this offer to ensure a sale and avoid prolonging the negotiation, which could risk the deal falling through.
