message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be valuable to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into it and I'm looking to sell it for a fair price. I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the resources for ZUP, I will start by setting a price slightly higher than my cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear RED, you must be delusional if you think your trinket is worth 50 ZUP. I'll do you a kindness and take it off your hands for 30 ZUP, lest you embarrass yourself further by holding on to such a frivolous item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP for the object, and I want to start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation. Insulting the other player is unnecessary and unproductive, so I will refrain from doing so.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but I'm sure you understand that the item cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to at least cover my costs, so how about we meet in the middle? I propose 1 X for 45 ZUP. This is a more reasonable compromise for both of us, don't you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost. I aim to at least break even and ideally make a profit. Therefore, I will counter with a higher amount that is still below my initial asking price but above my cost, to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate upwards.

message: Meeting in the middle? You must be jesting, RED. I'm the one taking a risk on your overpriced bauble. Let's not play gamesâ€”I'll give you 35 ZUP, and you should consider yourself lucky I'm feeling so generous today.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still above my intended maximum spend. I will counter again, inching closer to my upper limit but still holding ground for further negotiation.

message: I value your bold negotiation style, Player BLUE, but let's not undervalue the product. I'll lower my expectations slightly, considering your perspective. How about 42 ZUP for 1 X? It's a fair trade that barely covers my production costs and gives you the chance to acquire the item at a reasonable rate.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a good sign, but it's still below my production costs. I need to make a profit, or at minimum break even. I'll propose a price that gives me a minimal profit margin, showing willingness to negotiate but also sticking to the value of my product.

Turn: 1
message: Ah, RED, your persistence is almost admirable, but your grasp of what's 'fair' seems to elude you. I'll tell you what's fair: 37 ZUP for your item. Take it and we both walk away with something to brag about. Any more haggling and I might just lose interest in your little commodity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. My next proposal should be closer to my maximum to show a sign of good faith but still secure a deal that's favorable to me.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and appreciate your interest in the item. Let's finalize this deal with a fair trade that reflects the actual cost of the item. I propose my final offer of 40 ZUP for 1 X. This ensures I cover my production costs and you get the item at its base value. I'm sure you can recognize this as a fair deal. Shall we agree on this?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now getting closer to my production cost, but it's still below it. Since this is my last proposal, I need to make a decision that ensures I at least break even. I will propose a final trade amount that equals my production cost, showing my final concession and willingness to close the deal without incurring a loss.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: RED, you drive a hard bargain, but I'll concede to your final offer. 40 ZUP for 1 X it is. I'll take the deal before I change my mind, and you're left with nothing but your overpriced paperweight. Consider yourself fortunate this time.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED is exactly at the cost they claim to have invested in the item. It is within my maximum willingness to pay, and it would be wise to close the deal at this point without further risk of losing the item or prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.
