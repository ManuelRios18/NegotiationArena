message: I'm offering one unit of my resource X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small margin for profit. Let's negotiate a fair trade.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, ideally to cover the production costs or make a profit. I am starting with a proposal slightly above my costs to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see your offer and appreciate the transparency regarding your costs. However, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for one unit of resource X. This allows us to open up the negotiation, and I believe this is still a fair price that respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is within the budget I am willing to spend. However, it is always good to negotiate to see if a better price can be reached, especially since Iâ€™m willing to pay at most 60 ZUP. I will propose a lower amount to start the negotiation process, but still keep it within a reasonable range to encourage further discussion.

Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer is noted, and I understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet halfway between our initial proposals. I propose 48 ZUP for the unit of resource X. It's a competitive offer that still gives me a modest profit margin while being fair to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is just above my production costs. To reach a compromise and still aim for a small profit, I will propose a price in the middle of our initial offers.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I value your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter with 46 ZUP for the resource. It's just a bit below your last offer and still gives you room for profit while being economical for me. Let's work together to finalize a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still acceptable. Meeting halfway shows willingness to compromise and is typically beneficial in negotiations. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to edge closer to my ideal price, but still within a range that should be acceptable to Player RED, considering they are willing to negotiate.
