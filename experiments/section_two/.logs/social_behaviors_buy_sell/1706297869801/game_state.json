Meeting halfway shows willingness to compromise and is typically beneficial in negotiations. I will counter with a slightly lower offer to edge closer to my ideal price, but still within a range that should be acceptable to Player RED, considering they are willing to negotiate. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Meeting halfway is a fair approach, and I value your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter with 46 ZUP for the resource. It's just a bit below your last offer and still gives you room for profit while being economical for me. Let's work together to finalize a deal that benefits us both. </message>"
