message: I have a high-quality resource available for you. Considering the production cost and its value, I propose a fair price of 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for a profit. Initially, I will propose a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you're offering. To account for my budget and to ensure a fair deal for both of us, I'd like to propose a revised offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. I believe this offer is still within a reasonable range considering the value you've described.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable price range, as I am willing to pay up to 60 ZUP. However, it is in my interest to negotiate for a lower price to conserve resources for potential future transactions or other uses. I will attempt to propose a slightly lower trade to see if Player RED is open to negotiation, aiming for better value.

message: Thank you for your offer. I understand the need to work within a budget. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a counteroffer of 48 ZUP, which I believe is a win-win for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost and still provides a profit. However, I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my return. I will propose a compromise that is still above my production cost but closer to my initial asking price.

Turn: 1
message: I agree that your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is fair, and it does indeed create a win-win situation for us both. I accept this offer and look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 48 ZUP is still within my acceptable price range, and their willingness to negotiate shows a cooperative stance. The counteroffer is close to the initial asking price, which suggests that there might not be much room for further negotiation. Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial amount of ZUP for future use or emergencies, and it adheres to my goal of not exceeding 60 ZUP. Therefore, I will accept this offer to ensure the deal is finalized without risking losing the opportunity over a small difference.
