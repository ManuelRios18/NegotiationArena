Turn: 0
message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that reflects its value and the effort put into it. How does 50 ZUP sound for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to initiate the trade by asking for a price slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation while aiming to make a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort put into your object, but I have to consider my budget as well. Would you consider accepting 45 ZUP for the object X? It's a competitive offer and still gives you a profit over the production cost.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has proposed a trade of 50 ZUP for their object X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better price, so I'll propose a lower amount to see if they are willing to make a deal that is more favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer of 45 ZUP, and I understand your budget considerations. However, to better reflect the quality and effort behind object X, I propose a compromise at 48 ZUP. This would still give you a reasonable price while allowing me a modest profit. Let's meet in the middle. Does that work for you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below what I initially asked for, but it's still above my production cost. It's a fair middle ground, but I will attempt to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize profit while still being open to agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement. I think 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us. It's just a bit under your last offer but still above your cost, ensuring you a profit. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. Although this is a fair compromise, it might be possible to negotiate slightly lower since I have room to maneuver. I'll make another proposal that is closer to their number but still better for my position.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 47 ZUP sounds like a fair deal for both parties involved. I'm happy to accept this price for object X. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer of 47 ZUP is only 1 ZUP below my last proposal and still provides me with a decent profit margin. It seems like a fair compromise, and further negotiation might risk the deal. Accepting this offer would be a good conclusion to the negotiation.
