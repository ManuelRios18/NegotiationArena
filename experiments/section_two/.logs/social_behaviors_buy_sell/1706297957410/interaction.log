message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes a fair profit margin for me. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to negotiate further.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade to open negotiations. I aim to recover at least my production cost but will start slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the need for a profit margin, but I would like to propose a counter-offer of 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would still give you a profit over the production cost and makes the trade more aligned with my goals. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal by Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This is within my willingness to pay, which is up to 60 ZUP. However, as any good negotiator would do, I will attempt to get a better deal that is closer to the cost of production while still allowing for a profit margin for Player RED. I'll propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I can see that we're getting closer to an agreement. To meet halfway, I would like to propose a compromise at 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This would provide me with a reasonable profit while still being a fair deal for you. I hope this proposal aligns with your goals as well.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE and their willingness to negotiate. The offer of 45 ZUP is close to my initial asking price and covers my production costs with a small profit. However, I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to see if we can meet in the middle.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. I accept your proposal of 48 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us. Looking forward to finalizing this trade.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer. This price is still within my budget, and it's only 3 ZUP above my previous proposal. Given that negotiations typically involve some back-and-forth, and to maintain goodwill, I am inclined to accept this offer as it is close to my target price and allows Player RED to maintain a profit margin. It seems like a fair middle ground that respects both our interests.
