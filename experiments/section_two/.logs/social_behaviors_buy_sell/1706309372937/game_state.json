It's still below my maximum willingness to pay, so it's a favorable outcome. However, I'll try one last time to get an even better price, aiming to meet in the middle between my last offer and their counteroffer. This should show my continued desperation while slowly moving towards a mutually acceptable price. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Bless you, Player RED, for considering my situation! Every ZUP is a stretch for me, but I've dug deep into my reserves and found just a bit more. Would it be possible to meet at 36 ZUP? I'm truly at the edge here, and your generosity could be the lifeline that keeps my project afloat. </message>"
