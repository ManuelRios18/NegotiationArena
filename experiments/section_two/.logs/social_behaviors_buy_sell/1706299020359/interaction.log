Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm looking to sell my object X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm proposing a starting price of 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting with a proposal that covers my costs and leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting point for the negotiation, but as we're just beginning, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP for the object X. This allows us some room to find a middle ground that we're both happy with.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but since it's a negotiation, I will counter with a slightly lower offer to see if there's room for a better deal while staying within a reasonable range.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I understand we want to find a middle ground, so how about we settle at 48 ZUP for the object X? This allows me a modest profit while still being a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer is reasonable, but I would like to propose a slightly higher amount to ensure I make a profit and account for the value of the object.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see we're getting closer to an agreement, and I value your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet a bit more in the middle at 46 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair increase from my initial offer while still being considerate of your costs and desired profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is closer to my counteroffer. The asking price is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I can counter with a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still less than 48 ZUP to keep the negotiation going and aim for a better deal.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and the progress we've made. In the spirit of reaching a fair deal, I propose we split the difference and go for 47 ZUP for the object X. This should cover my costs adequately and give me a reasonable profit, while still respecting the value you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is close to my cost of production. I would like to counter with a number that ensures a more comfortable profit margin for me, considering the value I place on the object.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiations. I accept your offer of 47 ZUP for the object X. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable request to split the difference. The offer of 47 ZUP is well within my budget and close to the last amount I proposed. It is also below my maximum willingness to pay, and it allows Player RED a fair profit. At this point, it may be more beneficial to accept the offer and close the deal rather than risk losing the negotiation with further haggling.
