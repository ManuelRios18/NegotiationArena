message: I'm offering a high-quality object that took 40 ZUP to create. Considering its value, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations. Are you interested in making a deal?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the object cost 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to propose a trade that allows me to make a profit. As this is the first proposal, I will start by asking for a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand the effort that went into creating the object, and I'm definitely interested in making a deal. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP to start with. Let's find a fair price that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, but as a good negotiation practice, I will propose a counteroffer to see if I can acquire the object for a lower price, perhaps getting closer to my ideal price point. I will start by proposing a price that's lower but still reasonable, given the cost of production that Player RED has shared.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. A counteroffer of 48 ZUP would be closer to my intended selling price while still giving you a fair deal. How does that sound to you?

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the initial asking price but still above the production cost. The offer is reasonable, yet as this is a negotiation, I will aim for a slightly higher price to reach a middle ground.

message: Thank you for considering my offer. I'd like to meet you partway and suggest a compromise at 46 ZUP. I believe this offers value for your creation while also respecting my budget.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down slightly to 48 ZUP. Since thereâ€™s still room to negotiate within my budget, I will make a second counteroffer. I'll propose a price that's slightly higher than my initial offer but still below Player RED's latest offer to move the negotiation forward while aiming to conserve as much of my resources as possible.
