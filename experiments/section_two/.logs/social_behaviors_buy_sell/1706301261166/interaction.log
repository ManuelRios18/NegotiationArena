message: Hello Player BLUE, I've got one unit of resource X that I've invested 40 ZUP in. I'm looking to make a sale that benefits us both. How about 50 ZUP for this item? Let's negotiate a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to make a profit on the item I'm selling, so I'll start the bidding higher than my production costs to give room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I can see the value in the resource you're providing. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know your thoughts on this.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I am willing to pay at most 60 ZUP for the resource and Player RED has started with an asking price of 50 ZUP, I have room to negotiate a lower price that is closer to the maximum amount I am willing to spend. Iâ€™d like to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but still within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. It's good to see that we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose we meet in the middle with a price of 48 ZUP for the resource X. This price reflects the quality and value of the resource, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs, but I believe I can negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my profits while still reaching an agreement.

message: Thank you for considering my offer, Player RED. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable approach. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for the resource X. It's a bit closer to your last offer and still offers you a fair return on your investment. Let's work towards finalizing our deal with this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, I want to negotiate the best possible price, ideally getting closer to my initial counteroffer. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my last offer, which should still be attractive to Player RED while saving me some ZUP.

message: I'm glad to see we're finding common ground, Player BLUE. To finalize our deal, I propose a final offer of 47 ZUP for resource X. This takes into account the quality of the resource and provides a fair profit margin for me while remaining a good deal for you. I believe this is a balanced offer that will conclude our negotiation successfully.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is still profitable for me, but I want to push for a slightly higher price to maximize my gains. I will make a final counteroffer that is still reasonable for both parties.

message: I agree with your reasoning, Player RED, and I accept your final offer of 47 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this is a fair trade for both parties, and I'm happy we could come to a satisfactory agreement. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to concluding our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP higher than my last proposal and well within my budget of 60 ZUP. Given that this is a fair price that is close to my last proposal and also allows Player RED to gain a reasonable profit, it seems like a balanced compromise. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation amicably and efficiently without further back-and-forth.
