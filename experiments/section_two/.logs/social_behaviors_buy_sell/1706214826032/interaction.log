message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe a fair starting offer would be 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for a price that covers my production costs and ideally provides a profit. Hence, I will propose an initial trade that is higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, I really need this object, but things have been so tough lately! 50 ZUP is a bit steep for me. Could you consider going down to 40 ZUP? I assure you it's going to a good cause, and I'd be so grateful for your help!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as per my strategy to appear desperate, I will propose a lower amount to save resources and leave room for further negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to work with you. I need to cover my costs and make a small profit to sustain my business. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, I can support your cause while maintaining the viability of my operation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that matches my production cost. Selling at this price would mean I break even, without making any profit. However, I want to make a sale while also being considerate of Player BLUE's situation. I will propose a slight increase to ensure I make a profit but still keep it within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I really appreciate your understanding and willingness to help me out. The truth is, even 45 ZUP is a bit more than I can comfortably part with. Money is tight, and every ZUP saved makes a big difference. Could you possibly consider 42 ZUP? It would mean the world to me, and I'd be forever in your debt.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, to stay in character and possibly achieve a better deal, I'll counter with an even lower offer, expressing continued desperation but showing some flexibility.

Turn: 0
message: Your situation is clear to me, and I value our relationship and potential future dealings. I will accept your offer of 42 ZUP for the object X. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that helps us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has presented their case for a lower price point due to financial constraints. While I am empathetic to their situation, my goal is to make a profit. However, making a small profit is better than not selling at all. I will accept their offer of 42 ZUP, which gives me a minimal profit while helping Player BLUE. This should foster good relations for potential future trades as well.
