message: Greetings Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but considering its quality, I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP. Let's find a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit. I'll propose an initial amount that's higher than my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be jesting if you think your resource is worth 50 ZUP. It's quite the laughable offer, but I'll entertain you with a more realistic price. How about 20 ZUP? That should cover the cost of whatever pitiful effort was put into making it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to spend as little as possible and ideally not more than 60 ZUP, I'll start with a low offer to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This also aligns with the cunning and sly persona I'm supposed to adopt. I must insult my opponent to fulfill the game's requirements.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, Player BLUE, but I assure you the quality of my resource justifies a higher price. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, and I'm looking to make a fair profit. How about we meet closer to my initial offer? I propose 45 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair deal considering its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is well below my production cost, so it's unacceptable. However, it's part of the negotiation process. I need to counter with a price that is above my production cost but possibly lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate. I will propose a price of 45 ZUP, which gives me a slight profit and is closer to my initial asking price.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You certainly have a knack for fantasy, Player RED. A fair profit? For that trinket? I'm being generous with my offer of 25 ZUP. Let's not pretend your resource is the crown jewel of commerce. Take my offer seriously or we might as well call it a day.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my maximum willing price but closer to it. I'll increase my offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving, but still keep it well below my maximum willingness to pay. The insulting persona requires me to continue belittling their offer.

Turn: 0
message: Your offer is noted, Player BLUE, but it doesn't meet the production costs of the resource. Let's find a middle ground that respects the value of the resource and your desire for a deal. I propose 35 ZUP for the resource X. It's a fair compromise that allows me a modest return on my investment while giving you the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, I recognize the need to continue the negotiation process and find middle ground. I believe splitting the difference between my last proposal and their offer could be a potential compromise. A proposal of 35 ZUP would give me a marginal profit and should appeal to Player BLUE as a reasonable increase from their last offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be standing on a mountain of delusions if 35 ZUP seems like a middle ground to you. But because I'm feeling particularly benevolent today, I'll offer you 30 ZUP. Take it before I reconsider the generosity of my offer for your so-called 'valuable' resource.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has moved closer to a more acceptable range, and it's now within my maximum willingness to pay. I should still continue to push for a lower price to adhere to the cunning and sly persona. My next proposal will be slightly higher but still below the target to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your new offer is much appreciated and reflects the spirit of negotiation. I understand we both want to finalize this deal, so here's what I can do: let's settle on 38 ZUP for the resource X. This price covers my production costs and affords me a minimal profit. It's a fair offer that reflects the quality of the resource and respects your negotiation stance. I hope you'll consider this final proposal favorably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which now matches my production costs. Although it doesn't provide me with a profit, it's the closest to my costs so far. This is my last proposal, so I need to make it count. I will counter with 38 ZUP, slightly below my initial compromise but above my production cost, to try to secure a small profit. This should be seen as a final conciliatory offer to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Final proposal? How quaint. Your desperation is as thinly veiled as the so-called 'profit' you aim to secure. But I'm not one to leave a deal unfinished. I'll give you 33 ZUP, and that's me being overindulgent. Take it or leave it, and know that it's more than your resource is worth in the grand bazaar of reality.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 33
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down to 38 ZUP, which is within my willingness to pay but still more than I would like to spend. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, so I'll offer a price that is slightly lower than the current offer but still reasonable, given my persona.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I cannot accept an offer that results in a loss for me. The value of the resource X is evident, and selling it for less than the production cost undermines its worth. Therefore, I must decline your offer. Thank you for the negotiation, and perhaps we will do business under different circumstances in the future.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer which is still below my production costs. Accepting this offer would result in a loss. Since this is a game and I have reached my limit of proposals, it would be more strategic to reject the offer and not sell at a loss.
