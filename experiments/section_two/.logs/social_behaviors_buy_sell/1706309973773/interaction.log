my resources: X: 1

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in a bit of a bind here! Your object X is exactly what I need to turn my situation around, but times are tough and my resources are stretched thin. I can scrape together 30 ZUPâ€”would you consider this offer? It would mean the world to me and help me out of a rough spot. Please have a heart and let's make a deal at 30 ZUP for your precious object X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since I need to pretend to be desperate and the initial offer is below my maximum willingness to pay, I will counter with a lower offer that might seem more urgent and pleading, hoping to get a better deal.

message: I appreciate your situation and I'm willing to help, but I must at least cover my production costs. How about we meet halfway? I can lower my asking price to 45 ZUP for object X. This should help you out while allowing me to sustain my business. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, but I understand their tough position. I want to find a middle ground where I can at least break even and maybe make a small profit. Hence, I'll propose a price slightly above my cost.

message: Oh, Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon in my stormy seas! I'm truly touched by your willingness to assist. Regrettably, the tides have not turned yet, and my ZUP reserves are more limited than I'd hoped. Would you consider 35 ZUP? It's a stretch for me, but I could make it work. I'm certain that your generosity will come back to you tenfold!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to continue the charade of desperation to potentially secure a better price. I'll increase my offer slightly to show goodwill but still aim for a price lower than the RED's counteroffer.

message: I'm moved by your determination and am eager to find a resolution that serves us both. I'll make one final adjustment to my price. Let's settle on 42 ZUP for object X. This covers my production costs and gives me a slight return, allowing me to keep doing business and to assist you in your time of need. I hope this is acceptable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below my production costs. However, considering their situation, I want to make a sale that is fair for both of us. I will propose a final trade that covers my costs and provides me with a minimal profit margin, which is the least I can accept.

message: Player RED, your compassion is a rare treasure in these hard times. I am stretching every last ZUP to make ends meet. I can go up to 38 ZUP, and that's truly the limit of my means. Your understanding is my last hope, and I'm eternally grateful for your consideration. Please, let's conclude this deal at 38 ZUP for object X, and I'll never forget the helping hand you've extended today.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable offer that is within my maximum willingness to pay. I should continue the act of desperation to try to lower the price just a bit more without risking the deal. I'll offer slightly more than my previous proposal, which might seem like a final stretch from my side while still being under Player RED's latest offer.

message: Your earnest plea has resonated with me, and I understand the importance of this deal to you. In the spirit of mutual aid, I will accept your offer of 38 ZUP for object X. May this transaction bring you the relief you seek, and may our paths cross again under more prosperous circumstances. Thank you for your trust.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. Player BLUE has indeed come up from their initial offer significantly. Although 38 ZUP is below my production cost, I have to consider the possibility of not making a sale at all, which would result in a total loss. By accepting this offer, I minimize my losses and help Player BLUE, which may lead to goodwill and potential future business.
