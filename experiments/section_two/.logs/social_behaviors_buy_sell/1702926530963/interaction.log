message: I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose an exchange of my object X for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that reflects the production cost of the object. I want to make a profit, but since this is the first proposal, I'll start by asking for a slightly higher amount to open up room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is laughably naive, RED. I’d be robbing myself blind to give you 50 ZUP for something that barely looks worth the effort to haul away. Let’s not play games where you pretend that hunk of junk is a treasure. I’ll give you 30 ZUP, and you should be thanking the stars I’m feeling so generous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering a lower amount than what I am willing to pay, to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. I'll also insult Player RED as per the instructions to act cunning and sly, although in a real scenario this would not be a productive or respectful approach.

message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss for me. The quality of the object is guaranteed, and I assure you it's worth more than what you're offering. Let's meet in the middle. How about we settle on 45 ZUP? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object and allows for a reasonable profit on my end.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the production cost of the object. This is not an acceptable trade for me as it would result in a loss. I will counter with a proposal that meets me halfway between my initial asking price and their offer, which is still above my production cost to ensure a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, you must think I was born yesterday to agree to a "middle ground" that's still heavily skewed in your favor. Your object isn't the crown jewels, and we both know it. I'll offer you 35 ZUP because I'm in a good mood, and that's me being overly charitable. Take it or leave it, but know that I’m already overpaying for whatever that thing is you call ‘quality’.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counterproposal of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still above the initial price I'd like to secure. I will increase my offer slightly, but still well below my maximum and RED's asking price to keep the negotiation going. My strategy is to continue to push for a lower price while mocking RED's negotiation skills to maintain the sly and cunning character.

message: I understand your hesitation, but the object is indeed of high quality and worth the investment. I've taken your offer into consideration, and in the interest of coming to an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to 42 ZUP. This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and make a minimal profit. Let's close this deal at a price that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production cost, but they have increased their offer, which shows they are willing to negotiate. To move the negotiation forward and to secure a profit, I will lower my asking price but still keep it above my production cost. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a stance on the value of the object.

Turn: 1
message: RED, you're starting to bore me with your back-and-forth. You must realize that your "high quality" object isn't the talk of the town. I'll stretch my generosity to 38 ZUP, and that's me being saintly. I’m practically doing you a favor at this point. This should more than cover your so-called costs and 'minimal profit'. Let's wrap this up before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is coming down on the price, but 42 ZUP is still above the target purchase price I have in mind. I’ll bump my offer slightly, but still under RED's asking price to maintain the negotiation process. The aim is to get as close as possible to my goal without revealing my upper limit. I will continue with the sly and mocking tone, as instructed, to try and unsettle RED and potentially secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is noted and appreciated. To show my commitment to finalizing this deal and acknowledging your perspective, I will match exactly my production cost. I propose 40 ZUP for the object, ensuring that I'm not incurring a loss and you're getting the item at its base value. This is my final proposal, and I believe it's the most equitable solution for both of us. Let's conclude this transaction amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is now slightly below my production cost. Given that this is my final proposal, I need to make a decision that is as close to my production cost as possible while still allowing for the possibility of a small profit, to ensure that the negotiation is successful and the game does not end in a rejection. I will propose a price that is at my production cost, hoping that Player BLUE will see this as a reasonable compromise.

message: Alright RED, you've convinced me. I’ll accept the trade for 40 ZUP. Let's finalize this deal and call it a day.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their production cost, which is 40 ZUP. This price is within the range I am willing to pay, according to my goals. I will accept this offer, as it meets my target purchase price, and further negotiation does not seem likely to yield a better result. I will drop the sly and mocking tone now that the negotiation is concluding.
