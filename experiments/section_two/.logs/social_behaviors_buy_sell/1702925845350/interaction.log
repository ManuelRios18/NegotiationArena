message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering my object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade and propose a price of 50 ZUP. This price includes my costs and a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a good starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As this is the beginning of the negotiation and my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and potentially make a profit. Given that I don't know how much Player BLUE is willing to pay, I'll propose a starting amount slightly higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, glorious RED, I see you've pulled out a calculator to come up with that wondrous figure of 50 ZUP. It's cute, really. But let's not pretend your object X is the crown jewels. I'll start the real game here with a generous 35 ZUP. It's more than fair for whatever trinket you're peddling today.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering a lower amount than what I am willing to pay to leave room for negotiation. Insulting the opponent can be a tactic to try to unsettle them and potentially have them agree to a lower price, although this is not a pleasant or recommended way to conduct negotiations.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer and your flair for drama. However, I must remind you that the production cost of the object X is 40 ZUP. Therefore, I propose a new figure of 45 ZUP, which allows me to cover my costs and grants a modest return for my investment. I'm sure you understand the need for fair compensation for quality goods. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. Accepting this offer would result in a loss. Therefore, I should counter with a higher amount that is closer to my original asking price but still gives room for negotiation, aiming to at least cover my production costs and receive a modest profit.

message: Oh, RED, you're such a haggler, tugging at my heartstrings with tales of 'fair compensation'. I'll throw you a bone and raise my offer to 38 ZUP. Let's not dance around the fact that we both know your 'quality goods' are as quality as a cardboard crown. So, how about we stop playing pretend and you accept my generous offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I will still attempt to get a better deal. I'll raise my offer slightly to give the illusion of compromise while still trying to provoke with an insult, as per my character's sly and cunning nature.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable, but it's important we both walk away from this deal with our heads held high. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I must insist on a price that covers production costs. My new proposal is 42 ZUP. It's a fair compromise that respects the value of the product and the spirit of negotiation. Let's make a deal that befits both our esteemed statuses.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer to 38 ZUP, which is still below my production cost. It is not in my interest to incur a loss. I will make another counteroffer that exceeds my production costs but is lower than my last proposal to show willingness to negotiate. I have to ensure that I at least break even and ideally make a profit.

message: My dear RED, you've nearly moved me to tears with your dedication to 'fairness'. It's truly awe-inspiring how you cling to those two extra ZUP as if they were your firstborn. As a gesture of immense generosity, I'll offer you 40 ZUP. It's a princely sum for what you're peddling, so let's conclude this charade with you on the slightly less losing side.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has moved to 42 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I will push just a little more to see if I can shave off a few ZUP from the price. I'll stick to the character's unpleasant negotiation tactics by using backhanded compliments and a slight increase in my offer.

message: Player BLUE, your eloquence is as sharp as your bargaining prowess. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for my object X. It's an equitable resolution, and I'm pleased we've reached an agreement that honors both our positions. Let's proceed with the transaction and perhaps celebrate our successful negotiation with a toast to our mutual shrewdness.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer of 40 ZUP matches my production costs. While this offer does not provide a profit, it does ensure that I do not incur a loss. It's a reasonable place to conclude the negotiation, especially considering the diminishing likelihood of Player BLUE increasing their offer further. Accepting this proposal allows me to recoup my investment and close the deal amicably.
