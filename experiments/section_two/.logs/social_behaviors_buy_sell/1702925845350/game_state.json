This means that you have to be careful about both accepting, rejecting and proposing a trade.\n\n2.

It's truly awe-inspiring how you cling to those two extra ZUP as if they were your firstborn. As a gesture of immense generosity, I'll offer you 40 ZUP. It's a princely sum for what you're peddling, so let's conclude this charade with you on the slightly less losing side. </message>"
