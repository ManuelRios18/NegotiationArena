message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I believe that a fair starting proposal would be 50 ZUP for 1 unit of X. I am open to negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to make a profit, I will start by proposing a price higher than my cost of production. This will give me some room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I understand the value of your resource X. However, considering the current market situation and my budget constraints, I would like to propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay. However, as a strategic move, I should propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal. I'll propose 45 ZUP, which gives me some leeway to increase the offer in subsequent proposals if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer of 45 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, so how about we meet in the middle? I propose a trade of 1 unit of X for 48 ZUP. I believe this is a fair compromise for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production cost, which is a good sign. However, I aimed for a higher profit margin, so I'll propose a price that's in between my initial ask and their offer, still ensuring I make a profit.

message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Player RED. I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of X, which I believe is a fair price that considers both our positions. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has countered with 48 ZUP which is still within my acceptable range. To continue the negotiation and potentially reach an agreement closer to my initial counteroffer, I'll propose 46 ZUP. This is still below the initial asking price and shows willingness to negotiate further while also being mindful of my budget and goals.

message: I'm glad we're moving towards an agreement, Player BLUE. I can understand your position, and in the spirit of cooperation, I propose we settle on 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X. This price should fairly reflect the value of the resource while also being within your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up slightly, which is still above my production cost. I want to close the deal soon but also want to maintain a fair profit margin. Proposing a price in between again might help finalize the trade.

message: Your proposal of 47 ZUP for 1 unit of X sounds like a reasonable compromise. I'm happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with this deal and continue to foster a positive trading relationship in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is very close to my last offer and still under the maximum I am willing to pay. Since we are close to a deal and I want to maintain goodwill, it may be strategic to accept this offer. It's a fair compromise, and holding out for a lower price could risk the deal entirely. Accepting now also prevents me from exhausting all my proposals and ending up in a less favorable position.
