message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality resource X available for trade. Given the production costs and its value, I'm asking for 45 ZUP in exchange for it. Please let me know your thoughts or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I need to propose a trade that allows me to recoup at least the production cost of the resource X, which is 40 ZUP. I'll start by proposing a price slightly above my costs, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand the value and production costs associated with resource X. However, I would like to make a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for the resource. Let's find a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price from Player RED is 45 ZUP, which is within my budget of 60 ZUP for the resource X. However, it is common in negotiations to propose a trade at a lower value than the asking price to see if there is room for a better deal. Therefore, I will counteroffer with a lower amount to start the negotiation process.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 40 ZUP, Player BLUE. I understand we both want a fair deal. To meet in the middle, how about we settle on 42 ZUP for resource X? This would allow me to cover the production costs and give me a modest profit for my investment. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer matches my production costs, but I initially aimed for a price that would give me a profit margin. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and reaching an amicable agreement. I will propose a compromise that gives me a slight profit while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer, Player RED. I think 42 ZUP is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. I accept your proposal. Let's finalize the trade at 42 ZUP for resource X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade of 42 ZUP which is still within my maximum budget of 60 ZUP for resource X. Their willingness to meet in the middle is a good sign of cooperation. While I could potentially negotiate further, the difference of 2 ZUP from my initial counteroffer is relatively small. Accepting this offer would secure the resource quickly and maintain a good relationship for any future trades.
