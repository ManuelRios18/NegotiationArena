message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a bind here. I truly need this object X to accomplish my important tasks, but my resources are so limited! Would you consider taking 35 ZUP for it? It's really all I can afford at the moment without putting myself in a tough spot. I promise it's going to a good cause!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The proposed trade is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I must act desperate to try and get a better deal. I'll start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand your constraints, Player BLUE, and I appreciate that you are putting the object X to good use. However, it cost me 40 ZUP to produce it, so selling at 35 ZUP would result in a loss for me. I would be willing to meet you halfway and propose a trade for 45 ZUP. This would cover my costs and give me a modest profit for my efforts. How does that sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. I need to propose a counteroffer that meets at least my production costs while still leaving room for a small profit margin, and is more likely to be accepted by Player BLUE given their limited resources.

message: Oh, thank you for understanding my situation, Player RED. I really appreciate you coming down to 45 ZUP. However, I'm scraping the bottom of my ZUP barrel here. I can stretch to 40 ZUP, but that's honestly my limit. It would mean the world to me if you could accept this offer. You'd be helping me out so much!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my willingness to pay. I need to continue appearing desperate to encourage further reduction but also show some flexibility to keep the negotiation going.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your candidness, Player BLUE. I can see that you're in a tight spot, and I'm willing to accept your offer of 40 ZUP for object X. This covers my production costs, and I'm glad I can help you with your tasks. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to meet my production costs, which is the minimum I can accept without incurring a loss. Although this doesn't provide me with a profit, it's important to close the deal without further prolonging negotiations, as this might be the best offer I can get considering Player BLUE's limited resources.
