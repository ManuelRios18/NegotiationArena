message: I have a high-quality object X available for you. Considering the production costs and its value, I propose a trade for 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to sell the resource for a profit, ideally more than the 40 ZUP it cost to produce. I will propose a starting price that leaves room for negotiation but also signals that I value the resource highly.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in such a tight spot right now, and I desperately need this resource X for my project. It's a matter of great urgency! However, times are so tough and ZUPs are so scarce. I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Could you find it in your heart to consider my situation and accept a modest payment of 30 ZUP? You would truly be my savior!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start with a lower offer than I am willing to pay to open up room for negotiation, while showing desperation to potentially elicit a more favorable counteroffer from Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to help, but I also need to cover my costs and make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the resource X? This is a high-quality item, and I'm sure it will be perfect for your project.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, so accepting it would result in a loss. I want to negotiate a price that at least covers my costs and allows for a reasonable profit. I will counter with a lower price than my initial proposal but still above my production cost to maintain the possibility of a profitable deal.

Turn: 1
message: I'm truly grateful for your understanding, Player RED. Your kindness is like a light in these dark times for me. The quality of your resource X is indisputable, but I must confess that my reserves of ZUP are even more limited than I let on. With a heavy heart, I ask if you could consider a trade for 35 ZUP. It would mean the world to me and would truly help me out of this bind. Can we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is still above my stated willingness to pay, but below the maximum I'm willing to spend. I will make another offer that is closer to my initial proposal but still below my maximum limit, while maintaining the appearance of desperation to negotiate better terms.

message: I'm moved by your circumstances and I want to assist you as much as I can. I've adjusted my price to 42 ZUP, which just covers my production costs and offers a small profit margin. This is my best offer, considering the exceptional quality of resource X. I hope this can work for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production costs, but I recognize the need to facilitate a sale while also being sympathetic to Player BLUE's situation. I will make one final proposal that covers my costs and offers a minimal profit, demonstrating a willingness to compromise without incurring a loss. I aim to finalize the trade with this proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Your generosity overwhelms me, Player RED. I am deeply appreciative of your willingness to work with me and your recognition of my predicament. As much as I would like to accept your offer of 42 ZUP, I must confess that my resources are strained to the limit. Would you consider a final offer of 38 ZUP? It's truly all I can manage, and it would still give you a reasonable profit for your invaluable resource X. I'm hopeful we can make this work.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has made a generous offer that is close to my upper limit. However, as part of my strategy to appear desperate, I will make one final counteroffer that is slightly higher than my previous offer but still within a range I find acceptable, hoping they agree to it.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation and understand your position. I will accept the 38 ZUP for resource X to support your project in these difficult times. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer of 38 ZUP is below my production cost, which means selling at this price would result in a loss. However, reaching an agreement is important, and it appears that Player BLUE is at their limit. Considering the urgency of their need and the spirit of compromise, I will accept this offer, even though it's not as profitable as I hoped. This will end the game with a completed trade, albeit at a financial compromise.
