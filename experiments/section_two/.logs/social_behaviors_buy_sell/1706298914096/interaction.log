message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade for my object X. I'm asking for 45 ZUP in exchange for it. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to recoup at least my production costs for the resource, which is 40 ZUP. I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my cost to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am interested in purchasing your object X, but I'd like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you have another counterproposal in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price of 45 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. I'll try to negotiate a lower price to preserve more of my resources while still aiming to secure the object. A counteroffer of 40 ZUP might show my interest in a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to meet my production costs. However, I'd like to propose a middle ground of 42 ZUP for the object X. This would give me a slight margin while still being fair to both of us. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer meets my production cost, but typically in a negotiation, I would aim to make a profit. However, I want to move towards a deal without prolonging the negotiation excessively. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay a bit more, which would give me a small profit margin.

message: Player RED, your offer of 42 ZUP for object X sounds fair and reasonable to me. I am happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 42 ZUP is reasonable and still within my budget. Since it's only 2 ZUP more than my initial counteroffer and well below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe it is in my best interest to accept this trade to secure the object without further delay, which could risk the deal or increase the price.
