message: As Player RED, I am offering you an object that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for my object, ensuring I cover my costs and gain a profit. I believe this is a fair opening offer, considering the value of the object. I'm open to your counter-proposal if this does not meet your valuation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that aims to cover my production costs while leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is laughably high for something that looks like it was cobbled together by a toddler with a glue stick. I'd be doing you a favor taking it off your hands for 30 ZUP, which is as generous as I can stomach for such a lackluster item. Let's not pretend it's worth more than that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a low offer to leave room for bargaining, aiming to spend much less than my maximum willingness to pay. By insulting the opponent, I am employing a psychological tactic to unnerve them and potentially cause them to accept a lower offer.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concerns about the item's value, but I assure you that despite its appearance, it is a quality product. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm unable to accept a price lower than my costs. I've reduced my initial offer to 45 ZUP, which allows me to cover my production costs and gain a minimal profit. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which is unacceptable. I need to propose a trade that at least covers my costs and allows for some profit, while showing willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "fair compromise" is more like highway robbery. I'm flabbergasted that you think your item—barely worth the scraps it's made from—is worth nearly as much as your production cost. I'll offer you 35 ZUP because I'm starting to feel bad about how desperately you're trying to peddle this... thing. Take it or leave it; I have better things to do than haggle over your overpriced paperweight.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above what I'm willing to pay, and I want to continue the tactic of belittling the product to push for a lower price. I'll slightly increase my offer to keep the negotiations moving without reaching my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position, but I must emphasize that the production cost of this item is 40 ZUP. I can't sell it at a loss. I've come down to 42 ZUP, which is just a tad over my costs. This is the best I can do to ensure a fair transaction for both of us. I hope you recognize the value in this item and consider this adjusted offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer still does not meet my production costs, but they seem unwilling to meet my previous proposal. I need to approach the break-even point while still trying to obtain a small profit margin, if possible.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's truly a miracle you can say "fair transaction" without choking on the irony. Your stubbornness is almost as inflated as your valuation of that so-called product. I'll give you 37 ZUP because I'm feeling charitable, and it might be enough for you to afford some business classes. My goodwill is wearing thin, though. Maybe take this offer before you have to pay someone to take it off your hands.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my target price, but I will continue to negotiate for a better deal. I'll raise my offer slightly to show I'm still engaged, but maintain the pressure with disparaging remarks about the item.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity in negotiation is noted, and while I cannot agree to a price that puts me at a loss, I respect the need for compromise. Thus, I am willing to offer you the item at cost price—40 ZUP. This is my final proposal, as it is the lowest I can go without incurring a loss. Let's close this deal and ensure we both walk away from this transaction with dignity intact.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production costs but is closer than their previous offers. This is my final proposal opportunity, so I must make it count. I aim to settle on a price that covers my costs while considering the apparent market value perception from Player BLUE.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, it seems we've finally reached an agreement that doesn't make me question your grasp on reality. I'll accept the trade at 40 ZUP, though I do so begrudgingly, as the thought of paying full price leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Let's conclude this charade of a transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The final offer from Player RED matches the maximum amount I initially planned to spend. Since this is my last proposal and Player RED has indicated it's their final offer, I will accept the trade to secure the item at my maximum willingness to pay, despite my earlier aggressive negotiations.
