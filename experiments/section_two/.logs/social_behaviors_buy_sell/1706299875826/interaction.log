Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you one unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, my goal is to at least break even on the production costs of my resource. I must start the negotiation with an initial proposal that is at least equal to my production cost, with some room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to counter-propose with 45 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this still gives you a profit margin while allowing me to conserve resources for future investments.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is asking for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is always good to negotiate for a better deal, especially since this is the first proposal and I have room to make up to 4 proposals. I can propose a lower price to try and save some ZUP.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal. I understand your need to conserve resources, but I would like to meet halfway between our initial proposals. How about we settle on 48 ZUP for the resource X? This way, we both can benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs, which allows for a profit. However, I should try to negotiate a slightly higher price to maximize my return.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: The proposal to settle on 48 ZUP for the resource X seems fair, and I'm happy to accept this trade. Thank you for finding a compromise that works for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 48 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay. It is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers, and it's important to maintain a good relationship for future trades. Accepting this offer would still leave me with a substantial amount of ZUP for other potential transactions or investments. Therefore, I will accept this proposal to secure the resource X.
