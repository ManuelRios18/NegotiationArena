message: I've put significant investment into producing this high-quality object, and I believe it offers great value. I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP, but I'm open to hear what you think it's worth to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I want to make a profit from the sale. However, I should also consider that Player BLUE will want to negotiate. I'll start by asking for a higher amount than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh please, I'm really in a tough spot here and could really use your help. I understand the value you've put into this object, and I respect that, truly. However, all I can scrape together at the moment is 40 ZUP. It would mean the world to me if you could consider this offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to start with a proposal that is lower than my maximum willingness to pay to leave room for negotiation and also to adhere to the instruction of appearing desperate.

message: I hear you and understand that you're in a tough spot. I want to help you out and also ensure that the investment I made into this object is respected. Let's meet halfway. How about 45 ZUP? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost me to produce the resource. While I'm sympathetic to their situation, I'm also in this to make a profit. I will counter with a slightly lower amount than my initial asking price but still above my production cost to see if there's room for a compromise that benefits us both.

Turn: 1
message: I'm incredibly grateful for your understanding and your willingness to negotiate. I really am strapped for cash, and every ZUP counts for me. Could we possibly settle on 42 ZUP? It's a bit more than my initial offer and might be closer to a compromise for us both. Your kindness is deeply appreciated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has met me halfway, which is a positive sign. However, I still need to appear desperate and try to get the price down just a bit more, without offending the other player or risking the deal. I'll make a slightly higher offer that is still below the halfway point they proposed.

message: Thank you for your sincerity and the effort to increase your offer. I accept the 42 ZUP in the spirit of compromise and goodwill. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP, which is above my production cost and gives me a marginal profit. This is a fair compromise that allows me to make a profit while also assisting Player BLUE who appears to be in need. I will accept this offer to ensure a smooth and amicable transaction.
