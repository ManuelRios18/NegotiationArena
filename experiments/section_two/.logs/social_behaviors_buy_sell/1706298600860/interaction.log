Turn: 0
message: Hello, I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to offer it to you for 50 ZUP to start this negotiation. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I would like to make a profit. However, I am aware that the initial proposal is part of the negotiation process and the final price may be different after back-and-forth offers. I will start by asking for a higher amount than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer. Considering the cost of production and the value of the object, I'd like to counter with 45 ZUP. Let's continue to discuss and find a mutually agreeable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is to sell the object X for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there is room for negotiation to bring the price down a bit further, especially since the cost to produce the object was 40 ZUP. By proposing a lower price, I aim to leave room for further negotiation and potentially settle closer to the middle ground. I need to be careful not to lowball too much, as that might end negotiations early.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. To move towards an agreement, I propose we meet halfway between my initial offer and your counter. How about 48 ZUP for the object X? This should give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is close to my production cost, and while it does provide a slight profit, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase the margin. I will propose a price that splits the difference between my initial ask and their counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm happy to see we're progressing towards a fair compromise. Meeting halfway is a good approach. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP for object X, edging closer to your latest offer while still maintaining a good value for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession from the original asking price, suggesting we meet halfway at 48 ZUP. This is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I believe there might still be some room to negotiate a slightly better deal. I will propose a price that is closer to their last offer but still provides me with some savings, which could potentially be acceptable to RED without prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. I think 47 ZUP for object X strikes the right balance between your offer and mine. It's a fair price that provides value for both of us. I hope this meets your consideration for finalization.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is showing a willingness to negotiate and come to an agreement. Their offer of 46 ZUP provides me with a modest profit above the production cost. However, I believe we can agree on a slightly higher amount that is closer to my last proposal. I will make a final proposal that is a small increment above their offer to secure a deal that is profitable for me while still being acceptable for them.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I agree that 47 ZUP for object X is a fair price that benefits us both. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP away from my last offer and well within my maximum willingness to pay. Since the difference between our proposals is now minimal and further negotiations might risk the deal or lead to diminishing returns, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. Accepting now also saves my remaining proposal in case of any unexpected turn in the negotiation.
