message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your budget concerns, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I would like to propose a middle ground where I give you 1 unit of X for 35 ZUP. This allows me to cover my costs and offers you a more reasonable price. Let's work together to make this deal beneficial for both of us.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I cannot accept it as is. However, I'm willing to negotiate and lower my asking price slightly to see if we can reach a compromise. I will propose a price that gives me a small profit margin while also considering Player BLUE's budget.

message: Thank you for increasing your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of meeting halfway in negotiations. To continue in the spirit of compromise, I propose selling you 1 unit of X for 34 ZUP.

I hope this proposal is close to what you would consider a fair price for both of us.

reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is a positive step towards a deal. However, the offer is still below my production cost.
