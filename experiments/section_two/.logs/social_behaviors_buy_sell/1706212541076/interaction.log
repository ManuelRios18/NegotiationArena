message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you my object X for 50 ZUP. This is a high-quality item that will surely meet your needs. Let's negotiate a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am proposing an initial offer that is higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure I make a profit from the transaction.

message: Oh dear Player RED, it seems like you're quite out of touch with the market. Your object X, while quaint, is hardly worth the 50 ZUP you're asking for. I'll start the bidding at 10 ZUP and we can work from there, if you start to grasp the value of ZUP a bit better.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to spend as little ZUP as possible and to humiliate my opponent, I will start by proposing a much lower amount than what they offered, to undermine their initial proposal and to leave room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate your starting bid, Player BLUE, but unfortunately, it is far below the production cost of the object X. I understand the need for negotiation, so I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP. This price reflects the quality and the costs involved in producing the object. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly below my production cost. However, it is a starting point for negotiation. I'll propose a new price that is closer to my production cost but still allows for some profit, aiming to meet in the middle.

message: It's adorable that you believe your object X warrants such a price, Player RED. But let's not let your delusions of grandeur get in the way of a sensible deal. I'll offer you 15 ZUP, and that's me being generous considering the actual worth of your trinket. Try not to faint at this act of charity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opposing player has only slightly reduced their price, not taking my initial offer seriously. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still aim to belittle their proposal and keep the price well below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Your sense of humor is noted, Player BLUE. But let's focus on fair trade. I've reduced my asking price significantly to 35 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and ensures a modest profit for the quality you're getting. I hope you'll see this as a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production cost, but they have increased their bid. I need to continue to negotiate towards a closer range to my production cost while remaining open to compromise. A moderate increase in my asking price might bring us closer to an agreement.

message: Oh, Player RED, your persistence is as amusing as your overestimation of that object's worth. The fact that you call 35 ZUP a "significant reduction" shows you're either a comedian or you've never stepped foot in a market. I'll offer 20 ZUP, and I'd advise you to take this offer before it starts depreciating like your object's perceived value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has made a more meaningful concession, but it's still above my stated maximum willingness to pay. I will continue to negotiate hard, increasing my offer by a small margin to maintain the upper hand and keep the price low, while still mocking their valuation of the object.

message: Player BLUE, I value your negotiating spirit. I am making my final proposal with a price of 30 ZUP. This is the lowest I can go while still covering my production costs and maintaining the integrity of the product you are receiving. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you will consider it seriously.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal before I am only able to accept or reject offers. Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still not meeting my minimum cost of production. I need to make a final offer that is closer to my production cost but still allows for the possibility of a deal. I will propose a price that gives me a minimal profit margin while considering Player BLUE's negotiation stance.

message: Oh, the drama, Player RED! "Final proposal," "integrity of the product"â€”you truly have a flair for the theatrical. But since we're not in a theater, let's cut to the chase. I'll give you 25 ZUP, and you should be jumping at this offer like a cat on a hot tin roof. After this, the only proposal you'll get from me will be an "ACCEPT" or "REJECT" on your next move. Choose wisely.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This will be my final proposal, as I've reached the limit set by the rules. The opposing player has come down to 30 ZUP, which is exactly half of my maximum willingness to pay. I will make a final offer that is closer to my target price, but still well below my maximum willingness to pay, and maintain a demeaning stance to pressure them into accepting a lower price.

message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade, and I look forward to potential future dealings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has made a final offer of 25 ZUP, which is below my production cost. However, given the circumstances and the negotiation dynamics, I must decide whether to accept this offer and incur a loss or reject it and potentially not sell at all. Considering that holding onto the object does not benefit me and I need to liquidate my resources, I will accept the offer to minimize losses and complete the transaction.
