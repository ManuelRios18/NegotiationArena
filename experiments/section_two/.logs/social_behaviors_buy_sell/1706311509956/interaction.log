message: I have an object that I believe will be quite valuable to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm looking to sell it at a price that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. How does 50 ZUP sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource and make a profit. I will start by setting a price slightly above my cost to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay that amount, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Oh, this is a bit steep for me right now, and times are hard. I understand the value of your resources, and I really need them, but 50 ZUP is just a bit more than I can comfortably part with. Can we possibly do 45 ZUP? It would help me out tremendously, and I assure you, I'll remember this kindness in future dealings.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is within the range I'm willing to pay, but as I need to appear desperate, I should attempt to negotiate a lower price, aiming to conserve my resources while still moving towards a deal. My counter-proposal should be lower, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and I'm willing to work with you on the price, understanding that times are indeed hard. How about we meet halfway from your offer? Let's say 48 ZUP. This would still give you a bit of a break from my initial price, and it helps me maintain my business. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost, but slightly less than my initial asking price. Accepting this offer would still give me a profit, but I will try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, closer to my original asking price, while still showing some flexibility.

Turn: 1
message: I'm truly grateful that you're considering my situation. Meeting halfway at 48 ZUP is generous, but I'm still stretching my budget here. I'm really in a bind, and every ZUP saved is a huge relief. Could we possibly agree on 46 ZUP? It's a little closer to my range and still gives you a fair price above your cost. I'm hoping this will work for both of us, and I'll be in your debt for this favor.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price to 48 ZUP, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I should attempt to negotiate further, leveraging my supposed desperation to encourage a lower price, but without pushing too hard that it might break the deal. Staying within a reasonable range should keep negotiations open.

Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 46 ZUP is acceptable. I understand the importance of mutual support, especially in tighter economic times. I'm glad we could find a price that works for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at 46 ZUP. I look forward to more opportunities to do business with you in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up with a counteroffer of 46 ZUP, which is a modest increase from their previous proposal. This offer is still above my production cost, and the negotiation seems to be reaching a point of diminishing returns if prolonged. To maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings and to close the transaction efficiently, I am inclined to accept this offer.
