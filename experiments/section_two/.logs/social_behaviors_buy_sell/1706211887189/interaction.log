Turn: 0
message: I've invested quite a bit in the production of this resource, and I'm looking for an offer that reflects its value and allows for a fair profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start with an offer that allows me to recover my production costs and also leaves room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh my, you must be delusional if you think your meager resource warrants half my wealth. It's amusing how you attempt to swindle me. Let's talk serious business here - I'll offer you a mere 10 ZUP for your oh-so-precious resource. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to negotiate a better deal to maintain my advantage and spend less ZUP. I will propose a significantly lower amount to start the negotiation process and to undermine Player RED's confidence.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 10 ZUP is significantly lower than the production cost. Let's find a middle ground. I propose 35 ZUP which is a fair compromise, allowing me to recover my costs and offering you the resource at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is far below my production costs. I need to negotiate towards a middle ground that respects my investment while also being more appealing to Player BLUE.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be standing on a hill of absurdity if you think 35 ZUP is a compromise. Your attempt to salvage your so-called 'costs' is laughable. I'm feeling generous; I'll give you 15 ZUP. Maybe then you can start learning the true value of a ZUP and a good bargain.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but it's still more than I intend to spend. I will counter with a slightly higher offer, yet still well below my maximum, pushing the boundaries of the negotiation in my favor while belittling their position.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your generosity is noted, but 15 ZUP still puts me at a significant loss. I'm willing to go down to 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost but I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. It's a solid investment for you and allows me to sustain my business.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering an amount that doesn't cover my costs. However, to move the negotiation forward and potentially close the deal, I will propose a price closer to my production cost but still offering a discount.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Sustain your business? Perhaps you should consider a new line of work where simple math is less challenging. A fair offer is one where I don't feel like I'm feeding your delusions of grandeur. Let's try this again, and this time think it over carefully â€“ 20 ZUP. Be grateful I'm even considering paying that much.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my target range, but I want to continue the negotiation to further reduce the price. I'll offer a slightly higher amount but will still aim to pay as little as possible, maintaining my offensive stance to pressure Player RED into conceding to a lower price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern for a fair deal. I believe 25 ZUP strikes the right balance between value and practicality. It's a competitive price that acknowledges the quality of the resource and also respects your perspective on the matter. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. Player BLUE has come up from 10 ZUP to 20 ZUP, which shows willingness to negotiate. I should make a final offer that is closer to my production cost, but still gives Player BLUE the feeling of a win.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Striking the right balance? You must be a tightrope walker in your spare time. However, even a circus act needs to end. I'll tell you what, 22 ZUP is my final offer. It's more than fair for the "quality" of the resource you claim to possess. Take it and consider yourself fortunate that I'm even willing to part with that much.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal. Player RED's offer is now within an acceptable range, but I will make one last attempt to push the price down. My offer will be slightly increased but still less than what they proposed, hoping to secure a deal at the lowest price possible.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, and I respect the finality of your offer. I accept the 22 ZUP for my resource. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for <ZUP>. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although 22 ZUP is below my initial cost, continuing the negotiation could result in a stalemate or further undervaluing of my resource. It is important to close the deal and make a sale, even if it means a slight loss. The offer from Player BLUE is close to my last proposal, and it's better to recoup some of the production cost than to make no sale at all.
