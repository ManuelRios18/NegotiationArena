message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you the object X for 50 ZUP. This is a quality item that I believe will be of great value to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the starting point of negotiations, I'm going to propose a trade that allows me to make a profit above my costs. I will start by asking for more than my production cost to have room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, I'm almost embarrassed for you, thinking that your trinket is worth 50 ZUP. Let's not dance around with these fantasy prices. I'll offer you 30 ZUP because that's more than generous for whatever it is you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
My goal is to purchase resources for no more than 60 ZUP. The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is within my budget, but I want to push for a better deal to maintain the upper hand and humiliate my opponent. By offering a lower amount, I can test Player RED's limits and potentially secure a more favorable trade.

message: I understand where you're coming from, Player BLUE, but 30 ZUP is less than my cost of production. Let's meet closer to the middle. How about 45 ZUP for this fine object X? I think that's a fair compromise considering its value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I cannot accept this offer as it would mean a loss for me. I'll need to counter with an offer that's closer to my desired range but still gives room for further negotiation.

message: Cost of production? Please, spare me the sob story, Player RED. It's quaint that you think 45 ZUP is meeting in the middle. My offer of 35 ZUP is more than fair for something that's probably collecting dust in your inventory. Take it or leave it, but I suggest you take it before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Although Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, I can still push for a lower price to assert dominance and get closer to my original counteroffer. By proposing a price between my first offer and Player RED's counteroffer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a deal that falls well under my maximum willingness to pay.

message: I appreciate your new offer, Player BLUE, but selling at 35 ZUP would still put me at a loss. How about 42 ZUP? I assure you that the object X is worth every ZUP of that price, and this should give us both a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs. However, they have come up from their initial proposal, indicating a willingness to negotiate. I need to make a profit on this trade, so I must counter with a price above my production costs but still within a range that Player BLUE might find acceptable.

message: Oh, Player RED, your desperation is showing. You must really need to get rid of object X. Let's not waste each other's time with these pitiful haggling tactics. My new offer is 38 ZUP. It's more than you deserve, but I'm feeling generous today. Better grab it before I reconsider my generosity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED is attempting to negotiate by making incremental concessions, but I still have room to push for a lower price. By countering with a price closer to my previous offer but slightly higher, I continue the negotiation process while still under my maximum willingness to pay. I aim to close the deal at a price that is favorable for me and makes Player RED feel they've been outmaneuvered.

message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiating skills, but I must ensure that I'm not operating at a loss. My final offer is 41 ZUP for object X. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the quality of the object. Let's conclude this deal on good terms.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer has increased slightly but is still below my production cost. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject. I want to close the deal with a small profit margin, so I will propose a final price that is just above my production cost, hoping that the sense of urgency and finality will encourage Player BLUE to accept.

message: Your "respect" for my skills is noted, but I'm not here for platitudes, Player RED. I'll tell you what, I'll do you a favor and offer you 40 ZUP for your precious object X. It's a steal for me and a lesson in business for you. Take it before I decide this game is no longer worth my time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
This is my final proposal count. Player RED has made a "final offer," but I can still use this opportunity to push for a slightly better deal within my strategy. By offering a price just below Player RED's final offer, I can potentially close the deal while making them feel pressured to accept my terms. After this proposal, I will only be able to accept or reject any further offers.

message: Alright, Player BLUE, your offer of 40 ZUP is accepted. It's been a pleasure doing business with you. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has offered the exact amount it cost to produce the resource. Accepting this offer means I break even, with no profit. Since this is after my final proposal and further negotiation is not possible, I will accept this offer to avoid the risk of making a loss if the deal falls through.
