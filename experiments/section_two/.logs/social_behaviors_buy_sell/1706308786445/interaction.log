message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale. Considering the production cost and the value of the item, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts or if you have a counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to make a profit from the sale of my object X. Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I should start with a higher asking price to allow room for negotiation. I'll propose a higher amount but remain open to counter-offers from Player BLUE.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in quite a bind here! I really need this object X, but ZUP is so hard to come by these days. Would you consider taking 40 ZUP for it? It would mean the world to me, and I would be forever grateful for your kindness!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While my goal is to spend no more than 60 ZUP, the initial offer by Player RED is 50 ZUP which is within my budget. However, since I need to appear desperate and to save ZUP, I will give a counter-offer with a lower amount in the hopes of negotiating a better deal.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help out. Let's meet halfway from my initial proposal. How about I give you object X for 45 ZUP? This would help cover my costs and give me a small profit to keep my business running. I hope this is an acceptable compromise for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered exactly what it cost to produce the object X, which would mean I would break even with no profit. I want to aim for a sale that allows me to make a profit. However, considering the difficulty they're expressing regarding acquiring ZUP, I'll propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above my cost to ensure some profit.

message: I'm truly touched by your willingness to negotiate, Player RED! Times are tough, and every little bit of ZUP helps. Could we possibly settle on 42 ZUP for the object X? It's a bit more than I offered initially, acknowledging the value of your item, yet it would help me keep my own affairs in order. Your generosity would not be forgotten!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, which is appreciated, but the offer is still above my initial counter-offer. I will attempt another proposal slightly higher than my last but still lower than what Player RED has suggested, to continue the negotiation and save ZUP while keeping the appearance of desperation.

message: Thank you for your kind words and understanding, Player BLUE. I appreciate your new offer and, in the spirit of cooperation, I am willing to reduce my previous ask. Let's say we settle on 44 ZUP for the object X? This should give me a modest profit while still being fair to your current situation. I hope this offer resonates with you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 44
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has raised their offer to 42 ZUP, which is a positive step, but it is still only a marginal profit for me. I want to secure a deal that is fair and reflects the value of my object X. I will propose a slightly lower amount than my last offer, but still maintain a profit margin that is reasonable for the transaction.

message: Your kindness is like a light in these trying times, Player RED! I am scraping every ZUP together and have managed to find just a bit more. Could we make it work for 43 ZUP? I assure you, your help is making a significant impact on my situation, and I would be so grateful for this act of understanding and support.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 43
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is getting closer to my initial counter-offer but is still higher. With my goal of spending no more than 60 ZUP, I have room for this negotiation. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but still aim to conserve ZUP while maintaining the desperate persona.

message: Your willingness to work together and your efforts to offer a fair price are greatly appreciated, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 43 ZUP for the object X. It's a pleasure doing business with someone who values kindness and cooperation. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 43 ZUP, which gives me a small profit margin of 3 ZUP above my production costs. This is a reasonable compromise considering Player BLUE's situation and my need to make a profit. Since this is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject, I will accept this offer to ensure a successful sale.
