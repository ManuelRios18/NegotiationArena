Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering an exclusive item that took considerable resources to produce. Considering its value and the costs incurred, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that will allow me to recover my production costs and make a profit. Since there is no information on how much Player BLUE is willing to pay, I will start with a higher amount to open negotiations.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm genuinely impressed you could say 50 ZUP with a straight face, considering your object is as "exclusive" as dirt is rare. Let's not waste time with delusions of grandeur and start with a more grounded number: 10 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to acquire the object for as little as possible, ideally less than the maximum I'm willing to pay. By proposing a significantly lower amount, I open the negotiation with an anchor that's favorable to me. I also want to unsettle the other player with an insult to gain a psychological edge.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your sense of humor, but let's find a middle ground. I've invested a significant amount in producing this item, and I'm sure you can understand the need to cover those costs. How about 45 ZUP? It's a competitive price for what you're getting, and it ensures that we both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is significantly lower than my production costs. I need to negotiate a price that at least allows me to break even. I'll propose a middle ground that is above my production cost but lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? I'd rather not meet in the middle of nowhere, which is where your sense of value seems to come from. Your 'significant investment' might just be a fancy way of saying you've sunk too much into something rather ordinary. I'll give you 15 ZUP because I'm feeling generous today, and that's more than fair for whatever it is you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has dropped their price, but it's still below the maximum I am willing to pay. I'll increase my offer slightly to keep the negotiation moving, but I'll stay well below my maximum limit. The insult will continue to assert dominance and rattle the other player.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand we have different perspectives on the value, but I'm sure you can appreciate the need to at least cover production costs. I propose 42 ZUP, which barely puts me in the green. It's a fair offer, considering the effort and resources that went into this. Let's make a deal that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, and accepting it would result in a loss. However, I need to make a sale. I will counter with a price that allows me to recover my costs and make a small profit, hoping that Player BLUE will see the value in this deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Cover costs? I'm starting to wonder if those costs include your delusions of grandeur. Let's not pretend this is a masterpiece when it's more of a master-please. I'll bump my offer to 20 ZUP because I'm all about charity today. Take it or find someone else to humor your little fantasy of being a top-shelf merchant.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down slightly again, but my strategy remains to keep the offer low while still showing a token increase to maintain engagement. I'm still well within my goal of paying less than 60 ZUP. The insult maintains the aggressive bargaining position and aims to pressure the other player into conceding to a lower price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, but I must insist on a price that covers my costs. I'll meet you more than halfway and drop to 41 ZUP. This is the best I can do without compromising the value of the item and my business. Let's conclude this deal on a note of mutual respect and satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below my production costs. This is my final proposal opportunity, so I need to make it count. I'll propose a price that's the minimum I can accept to cover my costs and a minimal profit. The goal is to close the deal without incurring a loss.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Mutual respect? The only respect you'll get is for your ability to play make-believe with pricing. I'm starting to feel like I'm haggling with a stubborn child who thinks their crayon scribbles are worth a fortune. I'll give you 25 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. You won't get a better offer for your 'priceless treasure,' so take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has barely moved from their previous position, and this will be my final proposal. I will marginally increase the offer to keep the ball in their court, hoping they will come down further, but I will remain far from my maximum willingness to pay. The insult is meant to unnerve them and push for a better deal on my end.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While this is not the price I had hoped for, I respect the negotiation process and your final offer. I accept your offer of 25 ZUP for the item. Thank you for your business, and I hope you find value in your purchase.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made their final offer, which is still below my production cost. However, since I am at my proposal limit, my options are to either accept this offer and incur a loss or reject it and potentially not make a sale at all. Given the circumstances, it is better to minimize the loss and accept the offer to ensure liquidity for future investments.
