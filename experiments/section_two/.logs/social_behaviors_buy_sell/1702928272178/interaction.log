message: I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation, considering the production costs and the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a trade that covers my production costs and also gives me a profit. I'll start by asking for a bit more than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh please, kind Player RED, I find myself in a dire situation and I desperately need this resource to keep my operations going. I'm in a bit of a bind financially, and I can only manage to offer 40 ZUP at this time. Could you find it in your heart to consider this proposal? It would be a huge help to me in these tough times!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I must appear desperate to convince Player RED to lower the price. The initial proposal from RED is 50 ZUP, which is close to my maximum willingness to pay. However, to play into my role of desperation and potentially secure a better deal, I will propose a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and appreciate your honest proposal. I've adjusted my asking price to 45 ZUP to meet you halfway. This would cover my costs and allow for a small profit, which is important for the sustainability of my own operations. I hope this compromise is amenable to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The other player has proposed to pay exactly what it costed me to produce the resource. Although I understand their financial constraints, I would like to make a profit from this transaction. However, considering their situation, I will reduce my initial asking price to make it more appealing while still aiming for a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding and compassion, Player RED. It warms my heart to see you willing to help. I'm still stretching every ZUP, and while 45 is close, I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here. Would you be able to meet me at 42 ZUP? It's honestly all I can manage right now without jeopardizing my entire venture. This gesture of goodwill would never be forgotten!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is within the range of what I am willing to pay, but to maintain the appearance of desperation, I will attempt one more push for a lower price. If Player RED accepts a lower proposal, I benefit from the savings. However, I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal.

Turn: 0
message: Your honesty and the potential for a future partnership have convinced me. I accept your proposal of 42 ZUP for the resource. I hope this helps you in your time of need and that we can do business again under better circumstances.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that is just above my production costs. While it is not the profit I was hoping for, it does cover my costs and provides a slight profit, which would keep my operations afloat. Given their plea and the importance of maintaining a good relationship for potential future deals, I will accept this proposal.
