I'll increase my offer slightly, still well below my maximum willingness to pay, to keep the negotiation moving forward. The goal is to reach an agreement at the lowest possible cost to me. The insult tactic will continue to be used to try to pressure them into a lower price.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>45 ZUP? Are you selling gold-plated dreams? Even the idea of a profit for such an ordinary resource is comical. A smart merchant would know when to cut their losses and grab a deal before it slips away. How about I do you a favor and offer you 35 ZUP? Take it before I change my mind and realize that I'm overpaying for something I can easily find elsewhere. </message>"

I can afford to accept this offer and still be within my goal of paying less than 60 ZUP. This will be my final proposal since I've reached the limit of proposals I can make. The insults have likely contributed to them reducing their price, and I'll maintain the pressure until the end.\n</reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Halfway? Your math is as bad as your sales pitch. But fine, I'll extend one last act of mercy by offering 37 ZUP. Consider this a gift, because I'm all out of patience and you're all out of options.
