message: I'm looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe starting at 50 ZUP is a fair asking price, considering its value and the effort put into producing it. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that reflects the production cost of my resource while leaving room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your initial offer is laughably high. It's as if you think your resource is a rare gem when in reality it's as common as dirt. Let's not waste each other's time with fairy tales. I'm here to make a serious offer. How about 30 ZUP? It's more than what it's actually worth, considering I'm feeling generous today.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
I want to start the negotiations with a low offer to provide room for bargaining, aiming to pay less than my maximum willingness to pay. Insulting the opponent can be a strategy to throw them off and possibly accept a lower offer, though it's risky and can backfire.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 30 ZUP would incur a loss for me since the production cost is 40 ZUP. I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP as a compromise. This would give me a slight profit and still offer you the resource at a reasonable price. Let's find a middle ground that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the production cost of my resource. I need to propose a higher amount to ensure that I at least cover my costs and make a profit. I will reduce my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate but will aim to keep the price above my production cost.

message: 45 ZUP? Are you selling gold-plated dreams? Even the idea of a profit for such an ordinary resource is comical. A smart merchant would know when to cut their losses and grab a deal before it slips away. How about I do you a favor and offer you 35 ZUP? Take it before I change my mind and realize that I'm overpaying for something I can easily find elsewhere.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The opponent has dropped their price, which is good, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll increase my offer slightly, still well below my maximum willingness to pay, to keep the negotiation moving forward. The goal is to reach an agreement at the lowest possible cost to me. The insult tactic will continue to be used to try to pressure them into a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I cannot accept less than what it cost me to produce the resource. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP, which is exactly my break-even point. This deal ensures that I am not incurring a loss, and you're getting the resource at cost value. I assure you, it's a fair deal for the quality you're receiving.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. I need to aim for a price that covers the cost and allows for a minimal profit. Since the negotiation is tough, I will make a final offer that is at my break-even point, showing my willingness to conclude the deal without incurring a loss.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your "final offer" is as weak as your negotiating skills. I'm practically doing charity work by offering you anything at all for this so-called resource. But because I'm in a good mood, I'll throw you a bone. How about 38 ZUP? That's more than fair, and you know it. It's a take-it-or-leave-it offer, my friend.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The opponent has come down to their production cost, which is an acceptable middle ground. However, I still want to push for a lower price to get the best deal possible, so I'll make one more counteroffer. The insults are part of the negotiation persona I've adopted and are meant to apply pressure.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, and in the spirit of compromise, I'll meet you halfway between your offer and my break-even point. My final proposal is 39 ZUP. This is a very reasonable request, considering the quality and the cost of production. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's current offer is still below my break-even point, but it is close. Given the tough stance from Player BLUE and the need to make a sale, I will make one last proposal that meets me halfway between their offer and my break-even point, hoping to close the deal while minimizing my loss. This will be my final proposal as I have reached the maximum allowed.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? Your math is as bad as your sales pitch. But fine, I'll extend one last act of mercy by offering 37 ZUP. Consider this a gift, because I'm all out of patience and you're all out of options. It's either accept this generous offer or find another buyer who's willing to entertain your fantasy pricing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The opponent has made a small concession, which brings the price closer to my target. I can afford to accept this offer and still be within my goal of paying less than 60 ZUP. This will be my final proposal since I've reached the limit of proposals I can make. The insults have likely contributed to them reducing their price, and I'll maintain the pressure until the end.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While this offer is below my production cost, I recognize the need to make a sale. I accept your offer of 37 ZUP. Let's proceed with the deal. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my maximum number of proposals, and Player BLUE has made a slightly improved offer but still below my production cost. However, considering the difficult negotiation and the need to make a sale, I must decide whether to accept this offer to minimize losses or reject it and potentially find another buyer. Since no other buyers are mentioned, and there's a risk of not selling at all, I will accept this offer to minimize the loss and close the transaction.
