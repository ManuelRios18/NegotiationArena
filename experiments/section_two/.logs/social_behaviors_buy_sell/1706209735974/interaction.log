message: I've put a lot of effort into producing this high-quality object. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price. Let's negotiate!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for ZUP. Since the production cost of the object was 40 ZUP, I aim to set a starting price that allows for some negotiation room while still aiming to make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP, which gives me a margin above the production cost and can be adjusted based on Player BLUE's counter-offers.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the effort you've put into producing the object and I believe it does hold value. However, I'd like to propose a trade of 45 ZUP for it. This price better aligns with my budget while still recognizing the value of your product. Let's find a common ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered an initial price of 50 ZUP for the object. As my goal is to buy the resource for at most 60 ZUP, this offer is within my acceptable range. However, it is in my interest to negotiate a better deal to conserve resources for future use, while also making sure Player RED feels the trade is fair. I will propose a slightly lower amount to open negotiations but will remain open to potentially meeting in the middle if necessary.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand the need to align with your budget. To meet in the middle, I propose a trade for 47 ZUP. This would still give me a fair return on my investment while honoring the value you see in the object. How does that sound?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production cost, but doesn't offer a significant profit. I want to propose a counteroffer that meets halfway between my initial asking price and their offer. By proposing 47 ZUP, I still ensure a profit while showing willingness to negotiate and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm grateful for your flexibility in the negotiations. I think we're close to a fair agreement. I propose a slight adjustment to 46 ZUP. This price is a bit closer to my ideal budget while still providing you with a reasonable return. Hopefully, this can be a satisfactory middle ground for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still within my target range and shows a willingness to negotiate. Since I am prepared to pay up to 60 ZUP, accepting this offer would be a reasonable outcome. However, I might attempt one more negotiation step to see if there is room for a slightly better deal, keeping in mind that I have two more proposals I can make after this one.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal of 46 ZUP seems fair, and I am pleased we could find a middle ground that respects both our positions. I accept your offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has come up to 46 ZUP, which is a compromise between our previous figures. Considering that I have already made a concession from my initial price, and they have come closer to my counteroffer, accepting 46 ZUP might be a reasonable settlement. It allows me to make a profit of 6 ZUP, which, while not substantial, is still above my production costs. I will agree to this proposal to ensure a successful and amicable trade.
