More like I'd be stealing from myself if I paid 38 ZUP for that trinket. I'll do you a favor, and we can call it charity for the delusional. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and you can even tell your friends you made a sale today. Let's wrap this up before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthy, like a paperweight. </message>"
