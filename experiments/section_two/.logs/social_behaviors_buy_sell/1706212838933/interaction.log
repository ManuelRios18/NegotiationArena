message: I have an excellent quality item that I'm sure will meet your needs. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a fair price at 50 ZUP. Let me know what you think!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Starting with a proposal that ensures a profit margin above the production costs. This initial proposal is a bit high to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Ha! You call that excellent quality? I've seen better craftsmanship in a preschool art show. If you think I'm going to throw away 50 ZUP for that, you're dreaming. How about I do you a favor and take it off your hands for 20 ZUP before someone else laughs you out of the market?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My initial proposal should be low to give me room to negotiate upwards. By offering much less than what I'm willing to pay, I can make the other player feel that they have gained ground in the negotiation if they manage to increase the price, even though I would still be paying less than my maximum willingness. I will also try to undermine their confidence by insulting the quality of their item.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but let's be serious. The quality is well above what you suggest, and I cannot go below the production cost. How about we meet closer to my initial offer at 45 ZUP? This is still a very competitive price for what you're getting.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below the production cost, which is unacceptable. However, it does open the door for negotiation. A counter-proposal slightly above the production costs should be made to move towards a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Closer? The only thing close about this offer is how close it is to highway robbery. I'm starting to think you're more of a jester than a merchant with these comical prices. Let's not waste each other's time. The piece of junk you're peddling is barely worth the 30 ZUP I'm generously offering now. Take it or leave it, but don't insult me with these laughable demands.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has lowered their price, which is good, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I need to keep the pressure on and continue to insult the quality to try to get them to lower their price even more, without going over my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your sense of humor, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Quality like this at 38 ZUP is a steal, and you know it. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away happy.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below the production cost. As this is a negotiation, a compromise is necessary, but I must still aim for a price above the production cost to ensure a profit. A counteroffer that splits the difference between the last two proposals seems reasonable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: A steal? More like I'd be stealing from myself if I paid 38 ZUP for that trinket. I'll do you a favor, and we can call it charity for the delusional. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and you can even tell your friends you made a sale today. Let's wrap this up before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthy, like a paperweight.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player is inching closer to my desired price range, but they're still above the price I want to pay. I'm going to make a counteroffer that is closer to my target but still leaves room for a final move if necessary. I'll also keep demeaning the product to push for a better price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are as sharp as your wit. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP. It's a deal. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now very close to the production cost. Given the progression of the negotiation and the need to sell, it may be wise to accept this offer, as it minimizes loss and closes the deal. The offer also allows me to avoid a no-sale scenario, which could be more detrimental.
