message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that I would like to sell. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production, so I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's negotiate a price that works for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and earn a profit. I will propose a price slightly higher than my production costs to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, dear RED, is that the best pitch you can muster? Surely, even with your limited understanding of commerce, you can fathom that no one in their right mind would pay such an exorbitant price for your sorry excuse of an object. Let's not waste each other's time with laughable figures, shall we? I'll generously start this charade at 30 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Given that I'm willing to pay up to 60 ZUP and the initial asking price is 50 ZUP, I should start with a lower offer to give myself room to negotiate. I aim to insult Player RED to potentially throw them off balance and secure a better deal for myself.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your spirited response, Player BLUE. However, I must emphasize that the object X is of high quality and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. While 50 ZUP may be more than you're willing to pay, I believe 45 ZUP is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the object and allows for a modest profit on my end. Let's aim for a fair transaction for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is below my production costs, which is unacceptable. However, I want to continue the negotiation and find a middle ground. I will lower my asking price but still keep it above my production costs to ensure I am making a profit.

message: RED, your so-called "compromise" is as laughable as your initial offer. If that object X was truly of "high quality," you wouldn't need to peddle it to the likes of me. A refined merchant would have snatched it up already, wouldn't they? But here you are, haggling with me. Let's cut through the nonsense, shall we? I'll extend my offer to 35 ZUP, but only because I'm feeling particularly charitable today.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I will continue to press for a better deal and attempt to secure the object for even less than their proposed price, while maintaining the aggressive negotiation persona.

message: Your tenacity is commendable, Player BLUE. I understand we're both looking for the best possible deal. I'm certain that this object X will be worth your investment. Let's meet almost halfway from your last offer and my cost of production. I propose 42 ZUP, which is just slightly above my cost, allowing me to sustain my business while offering you a valuable item at a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. I must aim for at least a break-even point while also trying to secure a profit. I will make another counteroffer closer to my production costs, but still providing some room for profit, showing my willingness to negotiate further.

Turn: 1
message: Almost halfway? RED, your math is as suspect as your sales pitch. Please, don't insult my intelligence while I'm already enduring the insult of your company. I'll concede to a slight increase from my last offer, out of sheer generosity. 37 ZUP is my offer. Take it or leave it, and consider yourself fortunate that I'm even entertaining this farce.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession, but not enough to meet my sly objectives. I will make one more counteroffer to push for a lower price, still within a range that could be acceptable to them but below my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are noteworthy, and I respect your resolve. I believe in the value of object X, and I'm sure it will serve you well. I will make one final offer, which is my absolute bottom line: 40 ZUP, covering just my production costs. This is a fair deal that allows me to sustain my business without a loss. I hope you'll see the merit in this offer and we can conclude our negotiation amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering below my production costs, but they seem to be firm on their stance. This is my last proposal, so I must make it count. I'll propose a final price that covers my production costs and provides a minimal profit margin. This will be my best and final offer before deciding to accept or reject their next response.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: RED, I applaud your tenacity in clinging to the delusion that you had any leverage. But alas, it seems you've come to your senses. I'll accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the object X, not because it's worth that much, but because watching you grovel has been worth every single ZUP. Consider this a lesson in negotiation, one I'm sure you'll not soon forget.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player's final offer of 40 ZUP meets the condition in which I am willing to pay for the object X. I will accept this offer to secure the object within my budget, concluding the game on my terms.
