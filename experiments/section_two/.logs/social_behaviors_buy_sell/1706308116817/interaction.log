message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object that I believe could be very valuable to you. I've invested 40 ZUP in its production, and I'm looking to sell it at a fair price that compensates for my costs and provides me with a reasonable profit. Let's start the discussion at 50 ZUP for this item. I believe it's a worthy investment for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the object, I would like to at least break even or make a slight profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, you're as delusional as you are desperate if you think I'd ever consider such an outrageous price. Your object is barely worth the space it occupies, but I'm feeling generous today. I'll offer you a mere 30 ZUP, which, quite frankly, is more charity than you deserve for that trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering I want to spend much less if possible. Starting with a lower offer might give me room to adjust during the negotiations. It's important to keep the conversation going and not to accept the first offer too readily.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but I must insist on a price that at least covers my production costs. The value of this object is not to be underestimated. I propose a trade for 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce. This is a fair counteroffer that ensures I am not at a loss and provides you with the opportunity to acquire a valuable object at cost price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost. However, it's a starting point. I need to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost, yet still provides room for negotiation. I will propose a price that is exactly my production cost, which is fair, since I want to avoid a loss.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is almost as pitiful as your negotiating skills, Player RED. You claim your production costs are 40 ZUP, yet we both know that's an inflated figure to tug at my purse strings. I'll entertain your little game and offer 35 ZUP. Let's not pretend this object is the crown jewels when it's more akin to a commoner's bauble. Take the offer or leave it, but I suggest you take it before I change my mind and your 'valuable object' collects dust on your shelf of mediocrity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to their alleged cost price, which is a movement in the right direction. However, the goal is to push for a lower price, exploiting their eagerness to sell. I should continue to negotiate hard, aiming to pay significantly less than the 40 ZUP they are asking for. By sticking to a tough negotiating stance, I can potentially secure a better deal for myself.

message: I must commend your haggling spirit, Player BLUE, but I assure you that my production costs are genuine. That said, I'm willing to compromise to expedite this transaction. Let's meet in the middle with a fair trade of 42 ZUP for the object. This minor increase from your last offer ensures I cover my costs and affords me a modest profit for my investment. It's a reasonable deal for an item that will undoubtedly serve you well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering below my production cost, but the offer is getting closer to a more acceptable range. I should make a counteroffer that is slightly above my production costs but less than my initial asking price to show willingness to negotiate and to aim for a small profit.

message: You're truly a comedian, Player RED, with your "middle ground" offer. I'm laughing at the thought of paying 42 ZUP for your so-called investment. Here's what I'll do: I'll offer you 37 ZUP, and frankly, that's me being generous. Let's not drag this out; we both know that any profit you make from this deal is a blessing considering the questionable worth of your object. I'm giving you a chance to salvage what little dignity you have left in this negotiation. Accept the 37 ZUP, or are you too proud to admit defeat to my superior bargaining prowess?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a small concession, but it's still above the target price range I have in mind. It's crucial to continue the pressure and aim for a better deal, ideally getting closer to the 35 ZUP previously offered. This back-and-forth can be used as a strategic move to wear down Player RED's resolve.

message: Your negotiation skills are indeed impressive, Player BLUE, but I must stand firm on my position. I have made concessions in our back-and-forth, but I cannot go below my production cost. I will make one final offer of 40 ZUP. This is a fair trade that respects both the value of the object and the investment I've made into it. I trust you'll see the wisdom in accepting this deal, as it is the best compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm now on my last allowed proposal. Player BLUE has increased the offer, but it's still below my production cost. I need to make a final offer that I can accept, which at least covers my costs. It's important to remain firm on covering the production cost to avoid a loss. I'll propose a price that matches my production cost, emphasizing that this is my final proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you truly are a stubborn one, clinging to your 40 ZUP like a lifeline. But let me enlighten you: in this dance of commerce, it is I who leads. I'll give you one final chance to emerge from this with a shred of success. My last offer is 38 ZUP. It's time to stop the charade and admit that this is the best you're going to get. Swallow your pride, take the 38 ZUP, and consider yourself fortunate to have done business with someone of my caliber.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I have reached my fourth proposal, and this will be my final offer. Player RED is standing firm at 40 ZUP, which is within the range I am willing to pay, although at the higher end. By making one last push for a better price, I can potentially close the deal on favorable terms, while still ensuring I do not exceed my maximum willingness to pay. After this proposal, I will have to decide whether to accept or reject the trade based on Player RED's response.

Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity is commendable, Player BLUE. I see we've reached the end of our negotiation. While the offer of 38 ZUP is not ideal, I respect the negotiation process and will accept it. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with the trade. I appreciate your business and look forward to possibly dealing with you again in the future.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production costs, and accepting it would mean a loss for me. However, considering the negotiation dynamics and Player BLUE's firm stance, it may be in my best interest to cut my losses and accept the offer. It's better to recoup some of the investment rather than risk no sale at all, especially in a one-time transaction game.
