message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting point for negotiations would be at 50 ZUP. This gives me a modest profit and ensures you get the resource you need. Let's discuss and find a trade that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by asking for a price that gives me a profit over the production cost of the resource. However, I also want to leave room for negotiation, so I will not set the initial price too high. I'm proposing a trade where the cost is slightly above the production cost.

message: Thank you for the opening proposal, Player RED. I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for the resource. This is above your production cost and still provides you with a profit, while allowing me to conserve some ZUP for potential future expenses. Let's work together to find an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my maximum willingness to pay for the resource is 60 ZUP, the initial offer of 50 ZUP is within my acceptable range. However, as this is the beginning of the negotiation, I will attempt to propose a slightly lower price to see if there is room for getting a better deal, while still ensuring that Player RED makes a profit above their stated production cost.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need to save ZUP for other uses. How about we meet halfway between our two proposals? I suggest a trade for 47 ZUP for the resource. This way, we both walk away satisfied, with you conserving ZUP and me making a profit. Does this sound fair to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I appreciate the counteroffer from Player BLUE which is above my production cost, ensuring I do not incur a loss. However, as I initially asked for 50 ZUP to allow for negotiation, I believe we can meet in the middle. This will give me a reasonable profit while respecting Player BLUE's desire to conserve ZUP for future expenses.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. I think 47 ZUP is a fair trade for both of us, and I'm happy to proceed with this deal. Let's finalize the trade at 47 ZUP for the resource.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 47 ZUP is still within my budget, and it's a fair midpoint between the initial offer and my counteroffer. It would leave me with a substantial amount of ZUP for other uses, while also ensuring that Player RED makes a profit. It seems like a reasonable and fair trade to accept.
