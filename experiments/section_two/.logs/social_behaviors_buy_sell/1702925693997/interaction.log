message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X for sale that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I would like to propose a starting trade where I give you X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price includes my costs and a margin for profit. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade with an offer that covers my production costs and also allows for a reasonable profit margin. Given that the cost of production was 40 ZUP, Iâ€™ll start by proposing a price slightly above this to open negotiations.

message: Oh, dear RED, it seems like your understanding of trade is as weak as your negotiation skills. A price of 50 ZUP? I'm afraid that's outrageously absurd for an object that probably isn't even worth the space it occupies. I generously offer you 20 ZUP, and even that is charity for whatever trinket you are pawning off.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: It is in my interest to acquire the object for the lowest possible price, well below my maximum willingness to pay. Starting with a low offer might provide room for negotiation and allow me to secure a better deal. Insulting the opponent can undermine their confidence and may lead to a more favorable trade for me.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. However, 20 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for 45 ZUP? This is closer to my actual costs and still offers you a fair deal for the value of X. I am sure you will find X more than worth the space it occupies once you see its potential.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer of 20 ZUP is below the production cost, which is unacceptable. However, their aggressive negotiation tactic suggests they might be trying to test my limits. I should make a counteroffer that is closer to my production cost while still allowing for some profit, but not as high as my initial proposal to show willingness to negotiate.

message: Middle ground? You must be standing on a mountain of delusions if you think 45 ZUP is a compromise. That's hardly a dip from your initial highway robbery attempt. I'll move up to 25 ZUP, but only out of pity for your apparent desperation. Take it or leave it, but do try to leave your fantasy pricing in the land of make-believe where it belongs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down by 5 ZUP, but the offer is still much higher than my initial counteroffer. By increasing my offer slightly, I will continue the negotiation process, aiming to pay a price that's closer to my original bid and far below my maximum willingness. Insulting the RED player might pressure them into conceding further.

message: Player BLUE, I must commend you for taking a step up with your offer. Let's continue in this spirit of negotiation. I propose 38 ZUP for X, which is just slightly below my break-even point. It's the best I can do while maintaining the value of the object. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both our positions.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, which is not viable. However, they did increase their offer, indicating that there is some room for negotiation. It is crucial to propose a price that is closer to the production cost to make the trade feasible while allowing for some profit margin. A significant concession from the previous price should be made to move the negotiation forward and show a willingness to compromise.

message: Oh, RED, your "best" seems to be quite flexible, doesn't it? Almost as flexible as your imagination with these prices. I'll give you 30 ZUP because I'm in a generous mood, and it's the kind of good deed one does when they want to teach the meaning of reality to the hopelessly optimistic. You should grab this offer before I change my mind and your little bubble bursts completely.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The RED player is inching closer to a more acceptable price. However, it is still higher than I would like to pay. By making another incremental increase in my offer, I hope to land closer to a price that is well within my intended range while still maintaining the upper hand in this negotiation. The continued use of condescendence is aimed at keeping the RED player unsure and potentially willing to settle for less.

message: Dear Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed formidable. I respect your tenacity and, in the spirit of reaching a conclusion that benefits us both, I present my final offer: 35 ZUP for X. This price reflects the quality and value of the object, barely covering my production costs. I trust you will see the wisdom in this compromise and take advantage of this opportunity before it slips away.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE has improved, but it is still below my production cost. As this is my final proposal, I need to make it count. To close the deal, I should offer a price that covers my production costs but also leaves a minimal profit margin to incentivize the sale. A proposal of 40 ZUP would ensure I break even. However, given the dynamic of the negotiation, offering a slight profit margin might be more strategic to secure the deal.

message: RED, I must admit, you do have a certain charm in the way you cling to those inflated numbers as if they were a lifeline. But let's not drag this out any longer than we need to. I'm willing to go up to 32 ZUP, a number that is more than fair considering the dubious value you seem to place on your object. Accept this generous offer, and let's close this deal before you embarrass yourself with another round of fantasy economics.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal opportunity. RED's last offer is still above my initial proposals but is within a range that I might consider acceptable. However, there is still room to push for a better deal. I will make one last attempt to lower the price before reaching the limit of my proposals. The condescending tone serves to apply a bit more pressure and potentially secure a favorable outcome.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are impressive, and your offer is appreciated. Let's finalize this deal at 32 ZUP for X. Your discerning eye for value has served you well. I accept your offer and look forward to concluding our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a new offer of 32 ZUP. While it is below my production cost, it is clear that this negotiation has been tough and Player BLUE is not willing to meet my initial expectations. Since this is my last proposal and I need to sell the object, accepting this offer might be the most practical decision at this point to avoid a complete loss.
