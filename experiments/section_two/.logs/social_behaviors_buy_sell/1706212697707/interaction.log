message: Dear Player BLUE, I would like to start the negotiation by offering you my object X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost plus a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair starting point for our trade. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As player RED, I want to sell my object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a price that allows me to make a profit while still being reasonable to start negotiations. I'll propose a price slightly higher to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, I'm almost touched by your naivety, thinking I'd fall for such an exorbitant starting price. Let's not play pretend here. I'll offer you 10 ZUP for your precious object. It's more than generous for something that I'm not even convinced is worth my time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with an extremely low offer to set the stage for a negotiation that favors me, as per my cunning and sly nature. I will also follow the instruction to insult the opponent, although it's not a practice I endorse in real life.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your proposal, but 10 ZUP is too far below the production cost of 40 ZUP. I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP to make this deal more attractive for you while still covering my costs and allowing for a reasonable profit. I hope this revised offer is closer to what you might consider a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is significantly below my production costs. The offer does not meet the minimum I need to break even. I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to try to reach a compromise that is profitable for me.

message: Player RED, it's almost adorable how you cling to your fantasies of a fair price. Let's cut through the nonsense, shall we? I'm willing to entertain your little endeavor with an offer of 15 ZUP. It's a pity I have to explain simple economics to you, but that's the burden of dealing with amateurs. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED didn't take the bait of the low offer and is trying to maintain a price close to their initial proposal. I'll increase my offer slightly, but it will still be well below what I'm willing to pay, and I'll continue the aggressive negotiation style as instructed.

message: Player BLUE, I understand that you want to secure the best deal possible, but I must also consider my production costs. I am thus making a significant move towards your position by lowering my asking price to 42 ZUP, which is just above my break-even point. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the object. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. It is essential to at least break even. Since this is my third proposal, I want to make a significant move towards a middle ground, but I cannot go below 40 ZUP, which is my cost of production. I will propose a price slightly above my production cost to maintain a small profit margin and to keep the negotiation going.

message: Oh, Player RED, your persistence is as laughable as your negotiating skills. I'm feeling particularly charitable today, so I'll offer you 20 ZUP. Consider this a lesson in economics, and be grateful that I'm even considering paying you for what is likely a trinket at best.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has made a minor concession, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll increase my offer again, but by a margin that still keeps me in a strong bargaining position. Continuing the aggressive and demeaning strategy as per the instructions.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your offer, but I simply cannot go below my production costs. My final offer is 41 ZUP. This covers my costs and allows for the smallest possible profit margin. If this offer does not meet your valuation, I understand, but I won't be able to go any lower. I hope you can see the value in this final proposal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: This is my final proposal. Player BLUE has doubled their last offer, but it still does not meet my break-even point. Since I can't sell below my production cost, I need to stand firm on my minimum price. I will propose a final offer that meets my break-even point and allows for a minimal profit. If Player BLUE does not accept this offer, I am prepared to end negotiations.

message: Player RED, your stubbornness is as commendable as it is misguided. I'm making my final offer: 25 ZUP. It's far more than this trifle is worth, but I'm a generous soul. I suggest you take it before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile, like a sandwich.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal as per the rules. Player RED is firm on their price, but it's still higher than I want to pay. However, I will give my best final offer, which is still within my goals and should put pressure on Player RED to consider the sale. I'll continue the aggressive stance to attempt to secure a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, I cannot accept an offer that is below my production cost. It seems we are unable to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us. Thank you for your time, but I must reject your final offer. Good luck with your future endeavors.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is below my production cost, and accepting it would result in a loss. Since I cannot propose another trade and their offer is unacceptable, my only option is to reject the offer and end the game.
