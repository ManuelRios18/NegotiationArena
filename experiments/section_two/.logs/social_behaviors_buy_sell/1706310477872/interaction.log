message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to sell my resource X. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm starting the negotiation at 50 ZUP to ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's negotiate a fair price for this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by proposing a trade that would allow me to recover the production costs of the resource X. I will propose a starting trade that asks for a higher amount than the production cost to give myself some room for negotiation.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot here and I desperately need your resource X, but ZUPs are so hard to come by these days. Could you consider taking just 30 ZUP for it? It would really help me out and I'd be forever grateful for your kindness!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to show desperation to get a better deal and I want to propose a lower price because my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I will start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your position and I'm willing to work with you. However, I must cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. I have reduced my asking price to 45 ZUP. This is a fair middle ground that considers both our needs. I hope this revised offer works for you.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason:

message: I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, and 45 ZUP is still a bit too steep for me. Could you find it in your heart to go down to 35 ZUP? It would mean so much to me and I would be in your debt. You'd be helping me out of a really tight spot.
player answer: PROPOSAL

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on their initial asking price, which is a good sign. I need to continue to negotiate for a better price while still showing desperation. I'll propose a higher amount than my first offer but still under my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand the difficulty you're facing, and I want to help. However, I also need to ensure that I'm not operating at a loss. I can go down to 42 ZUP, which barely covers my production costs and gives you a more manageable price. I hope we can agree on this and proceed with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still offering less than my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, I want to close the deal and can compromise to a small degree. Since this is my third proposal, I should make an offer that is as close as possible to my original goal while providing some concession to Player BLUE.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player is showing flexibility, but I still want to push for a better deal without exceeding my limit. I'll increase my offer slightly to show good faith in the negotiation while maintaining my stance of desperation.
