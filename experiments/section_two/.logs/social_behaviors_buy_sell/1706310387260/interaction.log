message: I'm offering a high-quality resource that I believe will be very beneficial for you. Considering the cost of production and the value it provides, I think 50 ZUP is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to set a starting price above my cost of production to ensure a profit and to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a price that is high but not unreasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Oh please, I really need this resource for an important project, but I'm struggling with my budget. Could we consider a lower price? Maybe we could agree on 30 ZUP? It would mean the world to me if you could help me out here.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As part of the game strategy, I must appear desperate to get a better deal, so I will propose a lower amount of ZUP to start the negotiation. I will suggest 30 ZUP, which is significantly lower than my maximum willingness to pay and also lower than the initial offer from Player RED. This allows room for negotiation and improvement of the deal.

message: I understand your budget concerns and want to help you with your project. However, I need to cover my production costs and make a slight profit to stay in business. How about we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This way, we both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so accepting it would result in a loss. However, I want to maintain a good relationship and make a sale, so I'll propose a compromise that covers my costs and provides a minimal profit.

Turn: 1
message: I'm really touched that you're willing to work with me on this. I'm scraping together every ZUP I can, and it's still tough. Could we perhaps settle on 35 ZUP? It's a bit more than I initially offered and I'm really stretching my resources here, but I hope it can work for both of us. Your generosity would be greatly appreciated.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should continue to show desperation to try and get an even better deal. I will counter with a slightly higher offer but still below the midpoint between my first offer and Player RED's counteroffer to leave room for further negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, and I am willing to further adjust my price to facilitate this important project of yours. Let's agree on 42 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and allows me to maintain a sustainable business, while also supporting your endeavors. I hope this proposal meets your budget and we can proceed with the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my production costs, but it is still not covering the full cost. I want to make a sale, but I also need to ensure I don't operate at a loss. I will make one more counteroffer that is just above my cost to try and close the deal, keeping in mind that I want to maintain goodwill for potential future transactions.

Turn: 1
message: It's heartwarming to see you being so considerate and understanding. I'm truly in a bind here, and every ZUP saved helps a lot. Could we possibly do 38 ZUP? I really can't go much higher, and I'm hoping this could be our middle ground. Your support in this matter is invaluable, and I'm incredibly grateful for your flexibility.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down in price, but I must continue to negotiate for a better deal without offending or pushing too hard. I will make a final proposal that is closer to the last offer but still under my maximum willingness to pay. This should signal my intent to close the deal while maintaining the desperate persona.

Turn: 0
message: I'm truly moved by your situation and would like to support you as much as I can. I propose we go with 40 ZUP, which is exactly my cost of production. This way, I can sustain my business while still providing you with the resource you need for your project. I hope we can agree on this trade as a sign of good faith and a foundation for a future partnership. Thank you for your understanding and negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a sincere effort to negotiate and has come up in their offer. Although 38 ZUP is slightly below my production costs, I am considering the long-term relationship and potential future business. Accepting this offer would mean a small loss, but it could lead to goodwill and more profitable deals in the future. This is my final proposal, and I hope it will be acceptable to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: I can't express how much this means to me. Your willingness to work with me through these negotiations has been extraordinary. I gratefully accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource. It's people like you that make tough situations manageable. Thank you once again, and I look forward to a prosperous future partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 40 ZUP is within my maximum willingness to pay, and it appears that they are not willing to go any lower due to their production costs. I have reached my limit of proposals, and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and allows me to acquire the resources while respecting Player RED's position.
