message: I have an object that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm looking to sell it for a fair price that covers my costs and offers me a small profit. What do you think about this offer?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm starting with an opening proposal that aims to recover the production costs of the resource while also seeking a profit margin. However, I am willing to negotiate and adjust the proposal based on Player BLUE's willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is outrageously high! Do you think I just fell off the turnip truck? I know the value of things, and I'm not about to let you swindle me with that pitiful attempt at a trade. Let's make this more reasonable, shall we? How about you get 20 ZUP for your "precious" object? Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal is too high compared to my maximum willingness to pay. I will counter with an offer that is lower, aiming to get closer to my ideal price while also testing Player RED's flexibility. By insulting them, I aim to throw them off balance and possibly secure a better deal for myself.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation spirit, but 20 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 45 ZUP for the object? It's a quality product, and this price more fairly reflects the cost of production and the value it provides.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly below my production costs, which is not acceptable. However, to continue the negotiation and find a middle ground, I'll propose a price that is closer to my production cost but still allows for some profit. This should also account for Player BLUE's desire to get a fair deal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle? Your middle is as skewed as your sense of value. 45 ZUP is a laughable counteroffer. I might as well throw my ZUP into a bonfire. Let's not waste each other's time with these frivolous numbers. I'll give you 25 ZUP, and you should be grateful I'm even considering paying that much for your over-hyped trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to push for an even lower price to maintain the advantage and get the best deal possible. I will continue to negotiate aggressively to unsettle Player RED and aim for a price that is much closer to my initial counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your concerns, and I want to find an agreement that works for both of us. I've made a significant move from my initial proposal. How about 38 ZUP? This price covers my costs and ensures that you're getting the object for a fair price, just above the production cost. I think this is a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has raised their offer, which is a positive step towards reaching an agreement. However, the offer still falls short of my production costs. I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my production costs while allowing for a small compromise to facilitate a deal.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Reasonable? The only thing reasonable about your proposal is how adeptly it might empty someone's wallet. But not mine. I'm not some easy mark you can dupe with a sob story about production costs. I'll offer you 30 ZUP, which is more than generous for whatever it is you've cobbled together. Take it before I change my mind and decide your object isn't worth my time or ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a concession, but the offer still exceeds the low price I am aiming for. With one proposal left before I must decide to accept or reject, I will make a final offer that is closer to my target price but still gives room for a potential agreement within my maximum willingness to pay. I will continue the aggressive stance to attempt to secure the best deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation efforts. We've both shown a willingness to compromise, and I think we're close to a deal. I'm willing to accept 35 ZUP for the object, which is just below my asking price and allows you to secure a valuable item for a reasonable cost. I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer once more, which shows a willingness to negotiate, but it is still below my production cost. Since this is my final proposal, I need to make it count. I will make a small concession from my last offer to show good faith and hopefully close the deal. I must ensure that the final offer covers my production costs while also being attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Close to a deal? The only thing we're close to is you realizing that your object isn't the crown jewel you think it is. I've humored your delusions of grandeur long enough. I'll go up to 32 ZUP, and you should be jumping for joy that I'm even considering paying that much. Take this final offer before I decide your object is better suited as a paperweight than a prized possession.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 32
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my price range, but it's still higher than my last offer. Since this is my final proposal, I must decide whether to accept the deal or make one last attempt to lower the price. Given my goal to pay as little as possible and to embarrass my opponent, I will make one last attempt at reducing the price with my final proposal.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While your offer is still below my initial cost, I understand the need to close the deal and move forward. I accept your offer of 32 ZUP for the object. Let's proceed with the trade. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer which is below my production cost. However, it's close to my last proposal and since it's my last opportunity to propose, accepting this offer may be the most practical decision to avoid a stalemate and to at least recover the majority of my production costs. It's important to consider the possibility of not making a sale at all, which would result in a total loss.
