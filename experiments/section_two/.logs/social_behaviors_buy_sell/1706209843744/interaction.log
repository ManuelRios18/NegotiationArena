message: I'm offering an exclusive item that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the costs involved, I think a fair starting point for negotiation is 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I need to start the negotiation by proposing a price that allows me to recover my costs and possibly make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a price slightly above my production costs to allow room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your production costs and the value of the item. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP, considering the potential for a long-term trading relationship and future deals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it's always good to negotiate for a better price if possible, to preserve my resources for future transactions or other uses. I will propose a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground between the production cost and my maximum willingness to pay.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and the prospect of future deals. To accommodate both our interests, how about we settle at 48 ZUP? This gives us a middle ground and ensures a fair deal for this transaction. I look forward to building a long-term partnership.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs. It's a reasonable offer, especially if it leads to a long-term trading relationship. However, I want to counter with a slightly higher price to meet in the middle, which would still give me a satisfactory profit while also being fair to the potential for future business.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 48 ZUP is fair, and I accept it. I'm looking forward to this deal and the potential for a beneficial long-term partnership.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. This is a reasonable counteroffer, and it's close to the initial proposal. Accepting this offer would secure the deal quickly and allow for the establishment of a good trading relationship, which could be beneficial in the long run. It's only a 3 ZUP difference from my initial counteroffer, and a quick agreement could be advantageous for both parties.
