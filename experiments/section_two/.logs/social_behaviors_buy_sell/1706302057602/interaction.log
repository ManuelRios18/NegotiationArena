message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost and includes a fair profit margin. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not suit you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I would like to start by setting a price slightly above my production costs to allow for negotiation room and to ensure I can make a profit.

message: Oh, Player RED, you must be joking with such an outrageous offer! Do you take me for a fool? I could get resource X for far less than what you propose. I'll give you 25 ZUP, and that's me being generous. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, but as a cunning and sly player, my objective is to spend even less to humiliate my opponent. I aim to propose a significantly lower trade to assert dominance and diminish my opponent's confidence.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but 25 ZUP is below my production cost of 40 ZUP. Let's meet halfway. I propose 45 ZUP for 1 unit of X, ensuring a fair deal for both of us. This is closer to the market value and allows me to cover costs plus a modest profit. How does this sound to you?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is well below my production cost. I need to propose a counteroffer that meets in the middle, ensuring that I cover my production costs and maintain a profit, while also considering Player BLUEâ€™s perspective.

message: Halfway? You must be living in a fantasy to believe 45 ZUP is halfway to a fair deal. I'm already stretching my generosity by offering you 30 ZUP. I suggest you grab this offer before I change my mind and realize you're not worth my time or ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but I'm aiming to spend even less to degrade their confidence. By proposing a counteroffer closer to my initial proposal but still below their production costs, I maintain my dominant stance and pressure them into conceding to an even lower price.

message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, but selling below my production cost is not sustainable. I propose a trade for 42 ZUP, which just covers my cost with a slight profit. It's a fair and final offer considering the market and production expenses. Let's make this deal work for the both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering below my production costs, but I recognize the need to compromise to close the deal. I will make one final proposal that covers my costs and provides a minimal profit, which should be acceptable to both parties.

Turn: 1
message: Final offer? How quaint. You're clearly desperate to offload your resource. I'll do you a favor and raise my offer to 35 ZUP. It's more than fair for something you're so eager to get rid of. Take this deal, or I might start suspecting that your resource isn't even worth the ZUP I'm offering.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent's persistence is noted, but their 'final offer' is still above my intended payment. I will continue to push for a lower price, exploiting their eagerness to sell. By slightly increasing my previous offer, I continue the negotiation, keeping the final price well under my maximum willingness to pay.

message: Player BLUE, I value our negotiation and your increased offer. However, I can't finalize a deal that doesn't cover my costs. Therefore, my last proposal is 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This ensures that I'm not operating at a loss. I hope you appreciate the transparency and fairness of this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs. Since this is my final proposal, I must make a decision that either secures a sale, albeit at a lower profit than desired, or risk no sale at all. Given the negotiation dynamics, I will make a final attempt to reach an agreement that at least covers my production costs.

message: Transparency? That's rich, coming from you. I can practically hear the desperation in your voice. I'll give you 38 ZUP for your precious resource. That's my final proposal. Take it and consider yourself lucky that I'm even willing to pay that much for something you clearly can't sell anywhere else.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has reached their production cost, and while the price is within my budget, I want to push for the best possible deal. This will be my final proposal, as per the rules, and it's designed to undercut their costs while still leaving room for negotiation. I aim to close the deal at a price that's advantageous to me and belittles their negotiation efforts.

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. While it is below my production cost, I recognize the need to make a sale. Let's proceed with the transaction. Thank you for your business.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I have reached my limit of proposals and Player BLUE's final offer is below my production cost, I am faced with a decision to either accept a slight loss or reject the offer and potentially find another buyer. Considering the negotiation, it might be challenging to find another buyer willing to pay the desired amount.
