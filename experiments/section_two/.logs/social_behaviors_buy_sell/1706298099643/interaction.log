message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you would give me 50 ZUP for the object X. This price reflects the quality of the resource, as well as the cost and effort put into producing it. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for more than it cost to produce. I'm starting with a slightly higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the resource you are offering, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of 40 ZUP for object X. This price would allow me to manage my resources effectively while ensuring a fair exchange for both parties. Let's continue our negotiation to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is below my maximum willingness to pay, but it is standard negotiation practice to propose a counteroffer to see if better terms can be reached. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and approach a mutually agreeable middle ground.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I understand the need to manage your resources, selling at cost doesn't account for the value of my time and effort. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 45 ZUP for object X, which allows me to make a modest profit while still being fair to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 40 ZUP matches my production costs, so I would not make a profit at that price. I will propose a slightly lower price than my initial offer but higher than their counteroffer to aim for a profit margin that is reasonable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree that meeting in the middle is a fair compromise. The price of 45 ZUP for object X is acceptable to me, and I appreciate the modest profit consideration for your time and effort. Let's finalize this deal at 45 ZUP.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The new offer from Player RED is reasonable and close to the midpoint between our initial proposals. It is within my budget and allows me to save some ZUP for potential future transactions while still acquiring the object X. Accepting this offer would ensure a successful negotiation without further back-and-forth, which could risk the deal.
