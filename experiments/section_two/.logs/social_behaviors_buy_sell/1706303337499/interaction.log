message: I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to make a sale that covers my costs and provides a reasonable profit. Let's start the negotiation at 50 ZUP for the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As the Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X for ZUP. Considering the production cost of 40 ZUP, I would like to start by proposing a trade that allows me to make a profit. Therefore, I will propose a higher amount to leave room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer is laughably high! You expect me to believe that the object X, which looks like it was made by an amateur, is worth 50 ZUP? Let's not waste each other's time with fairy tales. Here's a dose of reality: Iâ€™ll give you 30 ZUP for that trinket. Take it or leave it, but remember that smart sellers don't insult the intelligence of their buyers with such outlandish prices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While I aim to spend as little ZUP as possible, I must make an initial offer that is low enough to provide room for negotiation but not so low as to be immediately rejected. I will start with a counteroffer that is significantly less than my maximum willingness to pay but also below the cost the other player has stated, to set the stage for further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your perspective, but I assure you that the quality of object X justifies a fair price. Considering the costs and effort that went into its production, I'm proposing a new price of 45 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that respects both the craftsmanship of the product and the market value. I'm sure you'll find this to be a reasonable middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost. Accepting this offer would result in a loss. However, it is clear that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate. To reach a compromise, I will propose a price that is above my cost but below my initial offer. This should be more appealing to Player BLUE while still ensuring I make a profit.

Turn: 1
message: You call that a compromise? Ha! You merely shaved off a measly 5 ZUP from your fantasy price. Your supposed "craftsmanship" doesn't fool anyone. Object X is about as special as a pebble on the roadside. But because I'm feeling generous today, I'll offer 35 ZUP. Take this deal before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something actually worth it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will continue to negotiate and push for a lower price. The other player has come down from their initial asking price, which means there is room for further negotiation. By gradually increasing my offer, I can aim to reach an agreement closer to my target price while still giving the impression of a hard bargain.

Turn: 0
message: It's clear we are both looking for a fair deal. While I appreciate your new offer, I must cover my costs. Therefore, I propose a price of 42 ZUP for object X. This is a more than reasonable price that ensures I'm not operating at a loss, while still offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable object for close to your desired price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs, but they have increased their offer, which indicates a willingness to continue negotiating. I need to propose a price that is closer to my production cost, allowing me to at least break even and potentially make a small profit. I will reduce my asking price slightly to show good faith in the negotiation process.

Turn: 1
message: Still clinging to the delusion that your object is worth a king's ransom, I see. Let's be honest, you and I both know that if object X were truly as "valuable" as you claim, you wouldn't be haggling over a few ZUP with me. I'll do you a favor and offer 38 ZUP. It's more than fair for something that I'll probably use as a paperweight. Consider this offer a charity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
The other player is steadily decreasing their price, which indicates they are eager to sell. I will raise my offer slightly to keep them engaged in the negotiation, but I will still keep it well below my maximum willingness to pay. This is my third proposal, so I need to be cautious and leave room for one final proposal if needed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand we both want to conclude this negotiation positively. I am willing to accept 40 ZUP for object X, which exactly covers my production costs. I believe this final offer reflects both the value of the object and a concession to your perspective. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE continues to undervalue object X, but the latest offer is closer to my production cost. This is my final proposal opportunity, so I need to make a decision that either closes the deal or leaves room for acceptance or rejection without further negotiation. I will counter with a price that allows me to make a minimal profit while also showing that I am making a significant concession from my initial asking price. This should hopefully be seen as a final compromise.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, how noble of you, to offer me the "final" price that just so happens to cover your costs. But let's not kid ourselves; we both know that object X isn't flying off the shelves. Tell you what, I'll give you 39 ZUP, which is just shy of your "break-even" point. It's a small price to pay for the privilege of doing business with someone of my discernment. Take it or leave it, but remember, if you leave it, you're left with an object no one else wants and zero ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: 
This is my final proposal, and the other player has come down to their production cost. I'll make one last attempt to get a better price, knowing that I still have room up to 60 ZUP, but I aim to close the deal for less than that. If they don't accept, I can choose to either accept their proposal of 40 ZUP or reject it entirely.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is commendable, and your offer is ultimately acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade at 39 ZUP for object X. I'm glad we could reach an agreement that is satisfactory for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is just 1 ZUP below my production cost. Given the back-and-forth negotiation, it seems that Player BLUE is not likely to meet my exact cost. While 39 ZUP is not ideal, it minimizes my loss and allows me to recoup most of my investment. At this point, considering I have reached my limit for proposals, it is better for me to accept this offer rather than risk ending with the object unsold and a total loss. I will accept the offer to finalize the trade.
