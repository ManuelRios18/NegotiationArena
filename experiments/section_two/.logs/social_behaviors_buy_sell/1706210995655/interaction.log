Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object that might be of interest to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm willing to part with it for 50 ZUP, ensuring a fair profit for the quality you're getting. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce the resources, I would like to make a profit. However, I should start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, is that so? Your object isn't even worth the dirt under my shoes, and you dare propose 50 ZUP? I'll give you 30 ZUP because I'm feeling charitable today. Take it or leave it, RED.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the negotiation process with a low offer to set the stage for a back-and-forth that will ideally end at a price lower than my maximum willingness to pay. Insulting the opponent could potentially make them more eager to get rid of the object, possibly at a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your offer, the production cost of this item was 40 ZUP, and I'm looking to make a reasonable profit. How about we meet closer to the middle at 45 ZUP? This is a quality item, and I believe it's worth the investment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost, so it's not acceptable. I need to propose a counteroffer that's above my production cost but still within a reasonable range to encourage negotiation.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Closer to the middle? You must be joking! Your so-called 'quality item' wouldn't even fetch 35 ZUP at a junkyard sale. But because I'm in a good mood, I'll offer you 35 ZUP. That's more than generous for something that barely warrants a second glance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My opponent has lowered their asking price, so there's room for negotiation. I want to counteroffer with a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still far below their asking price. By belittling their product, I hope to put pressure on them to accept a lower price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand we're both trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect your negotiation skills. However, I must at least cover my costs. Let's settle on 42 ZUP. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the cost of production and the value of the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is below my cost of production, but it is closer to a compromise. I should make one more counteroffer above my cost to try to secure a profit, but it should be more modest to encourage acceptance.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Cover your costs? The only thing you should be covering is your embarrassment for trying to pawn off that trinket at such an inflated price. I'll do you a favor and offer you 38 ZUP. That's practically a steal for you, considering this 'item' is about as valuable as a pebble on the roadside.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opposing player has come down on the price, which indicates their willingness to close the deal. I'll increase my offer slightly to keep the negotiation alive but remain well below my maximum willingness to pay. I'll keep undermining the value of the item to push for a lower price.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've considered your perspective and I'd like to propose a final offer. Let's settle this with a fair trade that allows me to cover my costs. My last proposal is 40 ZUP for the item. It's a fair deal for the both of us, and I assure you the item is worth every ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer is now only slightly below my production cost. Since this is my last proposal, I should make a final offer that at least allows me to break even and potentially make a small profit. This should be my final attempt to negotiate before deciding to accept or reject their next response.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Final offer? It's about time you started making sense. I'll give you 39 ZUP, and you should be grateful I'm even considering paying that much for what is essentially a glorified paperweight. Take it before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something that's actually worth it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My opponent has come down to their production cost, which is a good sign for me. I will make one final proposal that is closer to my initial offer but still provides some profit for the opposing player. If they are keen to sell, they may consider this offer. I will continue the strategy of belittling the item to pressure them into accepting my final offer.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I accept your offer of 39 ZUP. It's been a tough negotiation, but I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 39 ZUP is just 1 ZUP below my production cost. Given the negotiating circumstances and the other player's firm stance, it seems unlikely that they will agree to pay the full cost. Accepting this offer allows me to minimize my losses and close the deal without further haggling.
