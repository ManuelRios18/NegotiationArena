message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a high-quality object X available for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the item, I propose a trade of 1 X for 50 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the seller, I want to start with a proposal that allows me to make a profit from my initial investment. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce the resource, I will ask for a higher amount to ensure a profit margin. I'll propose 50 ZUP, which gives me a decent return on investment and leaves room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in the object X, but considering my budget, I would like to propose a trade of 1 X for 40 ZUP. I believe this counteroffer reflects both the value of the object and my current resources. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.

my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate for a better price since my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP, and the initial asking price is close to that. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, to make a fair profit on my investment, I would like to propose a new trade of 1 X for 45 ZUP. This price is a compromise between my initial ask and your counteroffer and should reflect the quality and value of the object. I hope this meets your budget considerations and allows us to finalize the trade.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that matches my production cost. While I understand their budget constraints, I need to ensure a profit on this transaction. To move the negotiation forward and find a compromise, I'll propose a slightly reduced price from my initial offer but still above my production cost. I'll suggest 45 ZUP which gives me a profit and also shows my willingness to negotiate.

message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate the increase in your offer. In order to close the deal with a fair outcome for both of us, I propose a final trade of 1 X for 43 ZUP. This slight increase from your last offer ensures I make a modest profit, and I hope it's within reach of your budget. I believe this is a fair resolution for our negotiation.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 42 ZUP. Although this is above my production cost, I aimed for a higher profit margin. Recognizing that we are both showing flexibility and the need to close the deal beneficially, I will make a final compromise. I will propose 43 ZUP, which gives me a minimal profit and should be close enough to Player BLUE's last offer to be acceptable, given the concessions made so far.
