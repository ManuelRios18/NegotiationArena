Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I have an object that may interest you. It's high-quality and cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to start this negotiation. Let's find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that aims to recoup the production costs of the resource while also leaving room for negotiation. A starting proposal somewhat higher than the cost makes sense to allow for bargaining and to potentially achieve a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the quality of the object you're offering. Considering the cost of production and the value for both of us, I propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP. This seems like a fair starting point for our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to acquire the resource for no more than 60 ZUP and the initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP, I have room to negotiate. I want to propose a counteroffer that is closer to my target but still leaves room for further negotiation, ensuring that I stay within my budget.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and appreciate your fair counteroffer. How about meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP? This price would give me a modest profit for my efforts and still provide you with the object at a reasonable price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer that is close to my production costs. To maintain a negotiation and potentially reach a middle ground, I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my costs to ensure a profit.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good to me. I propose 46 ZUP as a fair compromise that allows for a reasonable profit on your side while respecting my budget constraints. I believe this offer benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Meeting in the middle at 48 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable offer, but I still want to attempt to get a better deal without pushing too hard and risking the negotiation. A slight decrease in the price might be acceptable for Player RED while still providing me with a saving compared to the initial offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a fair compromise. Let's settle on 47 ZUP. This offer ensures I cover my costs and make a profit, while still respecting your budget. I believe this is a fair conclusion to our negotiation.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is willing to compromise further, which is a good sign. The offer is now above my production costs, so I am inclined to accept it. However, to ensure I maximize my potential profit, I will make one final counteroffer that is slightly higher but should still be seen as reasonable by Player BLUE.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable to me. It's a good balance between cost and benefit for both parties. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair middle ground that allows for a modest profit for Player RED and a satisfactory purchase price for me. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation on good terms and without further back-and-forth, which is beneficial considering the time and effort that may go into continued negotiation with potentially diminishing returns.
