You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> Player RED's latest offer of 47 ZUP is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal and well within my maximum willingness to pay. It is a fair middle ground that allows for a modest profit for Player RED and a satisfactory purchase price for me. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation on good terms and without further back-and-forth, which is beneficial considering the time and effort that may go into continued negotiation with potentially diminishing returns. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Your offer of 47 ZUP is acceptable to me. It's a good balance between cost and benefit for both parties. Let's finalize this deal at 47 ZUP for the resource. Thank you for the negotiation. </message>"
