You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The seller has come down to 25 ZUP, which is well within my acceptable range, but I will make one final proposal to see if I can secure the object for even less, while still keeping within the character I've been portraying. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Mutual satisfaction? The only satisfaction I'll get is knowing I didn't overpay for your so-called \"quality\" item. I'll put forth 22 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. I suggest you take this offer before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile. </message>"
