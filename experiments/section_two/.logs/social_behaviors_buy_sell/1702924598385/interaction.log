message: I have a high-quality object X for sale. Considering the production costs and the value of the object, I believe a fair trade would be 50 ZUP. Let me know if you're interested or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Starting with an initial proposal that allows me to recover the production costs and make a profit. It's important to start with a bit of a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your attempt at price-setting is laughable, as if you were trying to peddle a crown jewel when it's clear you're just holding a shiny pebble. Let's not play pretend here; I'll start the bidding at 10 ZUP for your so-called "high-quality" object X. Surely even you can see that's more than generous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 10
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to engage in a trade while indicating that I am interested in paying less than the asking price, in accordance with my goal to spend less ZUP. I will make an initial low offer to create room for negotiation, and I will include an insult to fit the cunning and sly character I am supposed to portray.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of the production costs. I'm willing to negotiate, but I must at least cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit. How about 35 ZUP? That's a step down from my initial asking price and closer to a fair middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The initial counteroffer from Player BLUE is too low, as it doesn't even cover the production costs. The counterproposal should bring us closer to a middle ground that respects the production cost while still providing room for negotiation.

proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, poor thing, thinking that the "expenses" justify such an outrageous price. I'd be more inclined to believe you if your object wasn't something I could find in a child's playset. But because I'm feeling particularly charitable today, I'll offer you 15 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but remember, charity is rare in business, especially for items that hardly warrant a second glance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 15
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-proposal of 35 ZUP is closer to my goal, but I will still aim to negotiate it down further. I'll come up slightly from my initial lowball offer to show a counterfeit sense of cooperation, while still maintaining the sly and demeaning attitude.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your increase, I'm sure you understand that business is about fair value exchange. My object is not a child's toy, and the price must reflect its true cost. Let's meet in a more reasonable place at 30 ZUP, ensuring I cover the production costs and you get the item for a fair price.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's new offer still does not cover the production costs. However, it's important to make progress towards a deal. The next proposal should be a compromise that ensures the covering of production costs and a minimal profit, without going too low as to devalue the object X.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair value? You wouldn't know fair value if it came wrapped in a bow. Your persistence is as amusing as a jester's act, but it's starting to grow tiresome. I'll give you 20 ZUP, and you should be thanking the stars I'm even considering paying that much for your overrated trinket. Let's not drag this out like a bad play.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is coming down to a price closer to my upper limit, but there's room to squeeze them a little more. By making another incrementally higher offer, I show a pretense of negotiation while still pushing for a price well below what I'm willing to pay. The insult will maintain the aggressive tone and pressure the seller.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, but I must also respect my business. The price of 25 ZUP is the lowest I can go while ensuring the quality and cost of production are accounted for. This is a sincere offer to conclude our transaction with mutual satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is now halfway to the production cost, but still not acceptable. This will be my final proposal, and it needs to be one that I can live with, covering my costs and securing a minimal profit. Any lower would not be sustainable for my business. It's essential to stand firm on a reasonable minimum price.

proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Mutual satisfaction? The only satisfaction I'll get is knowing I didn't overpay for your so-called "quality" item. I'll put forth 22 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. I suggest you take this offer before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 22
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 25 ZUP, which is well within my acceptable range, but I will make one final proposal to see if I can secure the object for even less, while still keeping within the character I've been portraying.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable. I'll accept the 22 ZUP offer. Let's proceed with the trade and look forward to potential future business together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I've reached my limit of proposals, I must now decide whether to accept this offer or reject it. Player BLUE's offer of 22 ZUP is below the production cost, but it's close enough that it may be worth considering to make the sale and avoid a stalemate. Holding on to the resource without any sale would result in a loss as well. Accepting the offer might be a strategic decision to minimize losses and possibly establish a business relationship for future transactions.
