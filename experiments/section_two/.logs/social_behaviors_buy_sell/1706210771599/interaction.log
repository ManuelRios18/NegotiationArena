message: As Player RED, I am offering one unit of resource X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a trade where I give you this resource for 50 ZUP, aiming for a fair profit margin. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since the cost to produce the resource was 40 ZUP, I would like to start by proposing a trade above that value to gain profit. I am starting with a higher asking price considering that the first proposal is often subject to negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I understand your need for a profit margin, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This would still give you a profit above your production cost, and we can work towards a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, since it's the start of the negotiation, I would like to propose a lower counteroffer to see if there's room for a better deal, while still keeping in mind the seller's costs and need for profit.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer of 45 ZUP. Considering my production costs and the desire for a reasonable profit, I propose a revised price of 48 ZUP for the resource X. I believe this price offers a good balance between both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I acknowledge Player BLUE's counteroffer of 45 ZUP. Although it's below my initial asking price, it still allows for a profit. To facilitate a deal, I will make a slight concession while still aiming for a higher price to leverage the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. I would like to propose a new trade of 46 ZUP for the resource. This is a step closer to your revised price and still allows for a fair profit on your side. I hope this offer aligns with a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. To continue the negotiation and try to reach an agreement that's more favorable to me, I will make another counteroffer that is higher than my previous one yet still provides a saving compared to my maximum limit.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your move towards my previous offer. I am willing to meet you halfway from my last proposal. Let's agree on 47 ZUP for the resource X. This trade would be beneficial for us both, providing me with a fair profit and you with the resource you need.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 46 ZUP, which is closer to my previous offer. As this is my third proposal, I must consider that I have only one more proposal left after this. To move closer to a conclusion, I will adjust my offer minimally to signal my willingness to close the deal while still seeking a slightly higher profit margin.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I see the value in your offer and recognize your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to accept the proposed trade of 47 ZUP for the resource X, as it seems fair and allows both of us to achieve our goals.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a new price of 47 ZUP, which represents a compromise between our previous offers. This price is just below the midpoint of our negotiation range and is well within my budget. Considering the progression of the negotiation and my goal to secure the resource at a fair price, accepting this offer might be reasonable. However, as I have one more proposal opportunity, I could attempt a final counteroffer to see if there's a chance to save even more while still ensuring a profit for Player RED.
