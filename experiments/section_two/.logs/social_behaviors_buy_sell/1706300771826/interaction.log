message: I have a high-quality object X for sale which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking for a fair trade that compensates my production costs and provides a reasonable profit. Let's start the negotiations at 50 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to recover at least my production costs, while also leaving room for negotiation. I'm starting with a higher asking price, expecting Player BLUE to negotiate for a lower price.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a fair trade. Considering the market and the value of the object X, I propose 45 ZUP. This should cover your production costs and still give you a profit, while also being a reasonable acquisition cost for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is within my maximum willingness to pay, but as negotiation allows for it, I'll propose a lower amount to see if there's room for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your reasonable offer. I appreciate that you acknowledge the quality and value of object X. To meet halfway and finalize this deal in good spirit, I propose a slight increase to 47 ZUP. This ensures a fair profit for me while maintaining a good deal for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come close to my initial asking price, which is a good sign. They're offering 45 ZUP, which covers my production costs and gives me a small profit. I believe we can settle for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit while keeping the deal attractive for Player BLUE. I'll counter with a small increase.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counteroffer of 47 ZUP is fair, and I am happy to accept it. It strikes a good balance for both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is still within my limits and shows willingness to close the deal. It's only a slight increase from my previous offer, and it's beneficial to accept this to ensure the acquisition of the object.
