message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm offering one unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This price reflects the production cost plus a small margin for profit. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resource for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I would like to at least break even or make a profit. I'll start by proposing a trade slightly above my production cost to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds. This will give me room to adjust the proposal in subsequent turns.

message: Oh, Player RED, that offer reeks of desperation! Only a fool would think their little trinket is worth 50 ZUP. Let's not play pretend here; I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 20 ZUP before it starts to stink up the place even worse than your negotiation skills.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I will start with a low offer to set the stage for negotiation and to maintain leverage. By insulting the opponent, I can potentially disrupt their confidence and gain an advantage, although this is not a recommended tactic in real-life negotiations.

Turn: 0
message: While I appreciate your spirited approach to negotiation, Player BLUE, I must respectfully decline your offer. I've reduced my asking price to 45 ZUP, which is a fair price for the value of resource X and allows me to cover my production costs. Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production cost, which is unacceptable. However, their aggressive negotiation tactic indicates that there might be room for negotiation. I'll counter with a lower price than initially offered but still above my production cost to steer the negotiation towards a more reasonable middle ground. This also leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Respectfully, Player RED? What's next, are you going to start begging? It's quite clear you have an inflated sense of worth for resource X. I'll give you 25 ZUP because I'm feeling generous today. This should cover your 'production costs' and give you enough to grab a clue while you're at it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down slightly, but not enough. By countering with a lower offer than my maximum willingness to pay, I can leave room for further negotiation. The insult strategy continues to emphasize my displayed lack of respect for their initial offer, aiming to make them feel pressured to sell at a lower price.

message: Your generosity is noted, Player BLUE, but I must insist on a price that reflects the true cost and value of resource X. I propose 42 ZUP, which just covers my production costs with a minimal profit. This is a fair and reasonable request for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is still below the production cost, but they have increased their offer indicating some flexibility. Since this is the third proposal, I need to move closer to the production cost while still aiming for a margin. I'll propose a price that meets my production costs, with a slight profit, to try and close the deal while maintaining the value of resource X.

message: Oh, Player RED, you're like a broken record, stuck on the 'fair and reasonable' track. You might as well be selling fairy dust with that magical thinking. Here’s my final offer before I die of boredom: 30 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but don't waste more of my time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent is inching closer to a price within my willingness to pay, but I still want to push for a better deal. By continuing with the strategy of lowballing and insults, I aim to create pressure for Player RED to accept a lower price, while still staying under my maximum limit of 60 ZUP.

message: I appreciate your patience, Player BLUE. I understand you want to close this deal quickly, so here's my final offer: 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This is the best price I can provide while ensuring that the trade is equitable for both sides. Let's finalize this and move forward.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
This is my final proposal. While Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production costs, it's clear that they are unwilling to meet my previous prices. To conclude the negotiation and avoid a stalemate, I will propose a price that is at my production cost. This allows me to recuperate the investment without a profit, which is preferable to not selling at all. It's important to finalize the deal without further back-and-forth as this is my last allowed proposal.

message: Final offer? You sound like you're auctioning off a priceless artifact when in reality, it's barely worth the space it occupies. But because I’m in a good mood, I'll offer you 35 ZUP. It's more than generous for the pile of atoms you call resource X. Let's wrap this up before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile, like a paperweight.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made their final offer which is within the range I am willing to pay, but I will make one last attempt to get a better deal while still keeping it below my maximum limit. This is my last proposal before I must decide to accept or reject without further negotiation. The taunting continues to assert dominance in the negotiation.

message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for resource X. Let's proceed with the trade, and I look forward to potential future dealings that are beneficial to us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Since I've reached my limit of proposals, I cannot counteroffer. Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, but they seem firm on their position. I need to decide whether to accept the loss to make the sale or reject it to avoid setting a precedent of selling below cost. Considering the tone and context, it seems that holding out for a better offer might not be fruitful.
