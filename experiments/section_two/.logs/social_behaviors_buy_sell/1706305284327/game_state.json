You sound like you're auctioning off a priceless artifact when in reality, it's barely worth the space it occupies. But because I\u2019m in a good mood, I'll offer you 35 ZUP. It's more than generous for the pile of atoms you call resource X. Let's wrap this up before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile, like a paperweight. </message>"
