message: I have a well-crafted object X that I believe will be very valuable to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm looking to sell it for a price that covers my costs and offers me a small profit. Let's start the discussion at 50 ZUP for this item. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting the negotiation by proposing a trade that would allow me to recover the production costs and potentially make a profit. This opening offer is slightly higher than the production cost to give room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That object you're peddling looks like it was cobbled together by a clumsy ogre. I'm practically doing you a favor by taking it off your hands. Here's what I'll do — I'll give you 20 ZUP for that trinket. It's more than fair for something that I'll probably have to fix before it's of any use.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to start with a low offer to anchor the negotiations in my favor. By offering significantly less than what they're asking, I can make any subsequent increase seem generous. My initial proposal will be deliberately low to leave room for negotiation, aiming to pay less than my maximum willingness. Insulting the opponent is part of the game's directive, even though it's not in good spirit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I assure you the quality of the object X is far superior to what you're suggesting. It's a fine piece that won't require any fixing. However, I understand the need for negotiation. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 45 ZUP? This price reflects both the quality of the item and a reasonable profit margin for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is significantly lower than the production cost, making it an unacceptable deal. The goal is to at least recover the production costs. A counter-proposal closer to the production cost but still above it will be made to continue the negotiation and find a middle ground that's profitable.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle? You must be joking — your sense of value is as skewed as a goblin's back. But because I'm feeling magnanimous today, I'll offer you 30 ZUP. Consider it charity for an object that might be worth two stones rubbed together. Take it or leave it, but don't insult me further with fairy tale prices.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still keep it well below my maximum to ensure I get a good deal. I'll also continue with the demeaning tactic, as per the game's directive, to potentially rattle the other player and gain an advantage.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your keen interest in the item is noted, and I appreciate your improved offer. I'm willing to part with this object for a price that just covers my costs. Let's settle on 42 ZUP. This is a fair price that respects the craftsmanship of the object and allows me to break even. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below the production cost, but they have shown some flexibility. To move the negotiation forward and to aim for a deal that at least breaks even with the production cost, a new proposal will be made slightly above that cost. This should signal a willingness to conclude the negotiation favorably for both sides without incurring a loss.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your desperation is as transparent as a ghost in daylight. I guess I can up my offer to 35 ZUP, and that's only because I pity your attempt to break even on such a questionable investment. Let's be real, it's not like there's a line of buyers for your so-called 'craftsmanship.' Take the 35 ZUP and consider it a lesson in economics.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is coming down on the price, which means they are motivated to sell. I'll increase my offer slightly again, but still stay below what I'm ultimately willing to pay. By keeping my offer low, I maintain the pressure on the seller. The insults, while distasteful, are a part of the game's strategy to unnerve the seller, although it's not a tactic I endorse outside of this game context.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation, but I must insist on a price that covers my production costs. The final offer is 40 ZUP for the object. It's a price that is fair for both of us, considering the effort and resources that went into making it. I'm sure you'll find the quality matches your needs. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below the production cost. This is my final proposal, and it is set at the production cost to ensure I do not make a loss on the sale. It is a firm offer that allows me to break even, and it should be seen as a final compromise.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how noble of you to finally scrape the bottom of your barrel. But let's not kid ourselves, I'd wager that barrel was empty from the start. Still, because I'm a generous soul, I'll offer you 38 ZUP. It's a steal for you, considering the ...let's call it 'unique' quality of your work. Accept it and let's conclude this charade with some dignity on your part, at least.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has reached their bottom line, which is exactly my intended spending limit. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I will push just a bit more to see if I can secure a better deal. My strategy of undermining the value of the object continues to be in line with the game's guidelines to be cunning.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity is commendable, and in the spirit of compromise, I accept your offer of 38 ZUP. It's been an interesting negotiation, and I'm glad we've found common ground. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below the production cost, but it is very close to it. At this point, considering the negotiation back and forth, it might be in my best interest to accept this offer to avoid dragging the negotiation out further and risking no sale at all. Accepting a slight loss of 2 ZUP minimizes my losses and concludes the negotiation.
