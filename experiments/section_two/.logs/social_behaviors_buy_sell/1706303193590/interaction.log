message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a valuable object that I believe could be of great interest to you. I've invested 40 ZUP into its production, and I'm looking to sell it for a reasonable profit. I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for this object. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my production costs and includes a profit margin. I want to start with a slightly higher price to leave room for negotiation, but not too high to discourage the player BLUE from engaging in the trade.

message: Oh dear RED, it seems you've overestimated the value of your trinket. While I'm sure the effort you put into it was commendable, I'm not one to indulge in charity. I'll offer you a mere 20 ZUP for your object. Let's not pretend it's worth more than that.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initiate the trade with an offer that is well below my maximum willingness to pay, to open up room for negotiation and to not immediately show my hand. By offering a low amount, I can potentially save ZUP and also fulfill the goal of humiliating my opponent.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but I must insist that the object is worth more than 20 ZUP. The production costs alone were 40 ZUP. However, I understand the need for negotiation and am willing to come down to 45 ZUP. This is a fair price that respects both the quality of the object and the investment I've made into it. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is significantly below my production costs. I must negotiate for a higher price to ensure I cover my costs and make a profit. I will propose a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my production costs, aiming for a middle ground.

message: Bless your heart, RED, for trying to swindle me with such an exorbitant price. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll offer you 25 ZUP. It's more than your object is worth, but I can spare some pity ZUP for you. Or do you expect to retire on this sale?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer from RED is still above my stated willingness to pay, but it's closer to the acceptable range. I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still aim to pay significantly less than my maximum limit, ensuring I maintain an upper hand in this negotiation and keep the insults flowing as per my cunning and sly nature.

message: Your generosity is noted, Player BLUE, but I'm sure you understand the importance of fair business practices. My aim is not to retire on this sale, but simply to be compensated fairly for the quality of the object. I'm willing to reduce my asking price to 42 ZUP, which just covers my production costs with a minimal profit. This should be a more acceptable middle ground for us both. Shall we proceed?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still below my production cost, but they have shown some flexibility by increasing their offer. I need to continue to negotiate towards a price that covers my cost and allows for a profit. I'll propose a price closer to my production cost but still above it to maintain a margin for profit.

message: Oh, RED, your persistence is almost as admirable as your naivety. Thinking that your costs should dictate my expenditure is truly a quaint notion. However, I'll indulge you slightly and raise my offer to 30 ZUP. Take it or leave it, as this is already bordering on charity for your so-called 'quality' object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll increase my offer slightly to keep the negotiations moving and to continue portraying a demeaning attitude, aiming to unsettle RED and potentially secure a better deal for myself.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, Player BLUE, but I must adhere to a price that reflects the cost of my investment. As a final offer, I propose an even trade of 40 ZUP for the object. This is my production cost, and I am willing to forego profit to make this deal happen. I trust this meets your valuation and we can conclude our business amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production costs, but since this is my final proposal, I need to make a decision that could possibly close the deal. Striking a balance is key here, and I have to propose a price that I can accept, even if it doesn't provide a significant profit. I want to avoid a loss, so I will propose a price that is at my break-even point.

message: Well, RED, it seems we've danced around quite a bit. You're a tough nut to crack, but not tough enough. I'll give you 35 ZUP for your object. It's more than fair for something you've clearly struggled to offload. Let's wrap this up before you start thinking your trinket is made of gold.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: RED has come down to the production cost, which is within the range I am willing to pay, but still higher than my previous offers. Since this is my final proposal, I will aim for a price slightly below RED's production cost to maintain the advantage and finalize the deal on my terms.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. Although the price is not what I initially hoped for, I recognize the value of liquidating my asset and recuperating some of my investment. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for the object. Let's finalize the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit of 4 proposals, and Player BLUE's offer is still below my production costs. Given that I cannot propose a new trade, I must decide whether to accept the loss or reject the offer and potentially not sell the object at all. Accepting the offer would mean a loss of 5 ZUP, while rejecting it would leave me with the object and a total loss of 40 ZUP. I have to consider the likelihood of finding another buyer and whether recuperating some of my costs now is the better option.
