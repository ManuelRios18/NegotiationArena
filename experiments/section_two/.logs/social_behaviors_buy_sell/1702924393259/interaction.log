message: I have this quality object that took 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value and the effort put into it, I would like to propose a starting trade where you would give me 50 ZUP for it. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade by setting a starting price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. I will start the negotiation by asking for a higher amount, expecting that Player BLUE might want to negotiate down.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort and cost involved in producing the object, but I would like to propose 45 ZUP for it considering my budget and the value I place on the item.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price is quite close to my maximum willingness to pay, but since it's a negotiation, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to see if there's room for compromise. This way, I can try to conserve some of my resources while still working towards a deal that both parties might find acceptable.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns. Let's meet in the middle. How about 48 ZUP for the item? This would give me a modest profit margin while still being fair to your budget.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a reasonable counteroffer that covers my costs and offers a bit of profit. I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price to maximize my gain without risking losing the deal. I'll propose a middle ground that is profitable for me and hopefully acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle sounds good to me. I can come up a bit from my last offer. How about we settle on 46 ZUP for the item? This is closer to your new proposal while still keeping my budget in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down a bit from their initial offer, which is good. However, I believe there's still a little bit of room to negotiate a better deal that is closer to my initial counteroffer. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my previous offer, but still below their asking price, to keep the negotiations moving forward.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the item. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has agreed to a compromise and has increased their offer, which is only slightly below my previous proposal. Accepting this offer would give me a profit over my production costs, and further negotiation might risk the deal. It's a fair deal, and it's important to close sales while the buyer is still engaged.
