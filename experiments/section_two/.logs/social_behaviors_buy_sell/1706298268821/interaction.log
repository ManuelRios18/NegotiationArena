message: I am offering one unit of X for 50 ZUP. This price includes the cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my first proposal, I want to start by setting a price that gives me a profit over the production cost, but is not excessively high so as to discourage Player BLUE from negotiating. I'll propose a price that is above the production cost but within a range that could be seen as reasonable for an initial offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slight adjustment. I believe a fair trade would be one unit of X for 45 ZUP, considering the market conditions and the value of the resource. Let's work together to reach an agreeable trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X. This is within my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is a good negotiating strategy to propose a lower amount to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better deal.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. How about we meet halfway? I propose trading one unit of X for 48 ZUP. This price accounts for both our positions and allows for a fair profit margin. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is close to my initial asking price. Since the counteroffer is above my production cost, it still allows for a profit. To facilitate a successful negotiation and considering the market conditions they mentioned, I'll propose a slightly higher price, aiming to meet in the middle and hoping that Player BLUE finds this reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Meeting halfway is a great suggestion, and I thank you for it. To move closer to a deal we both find fair, I propose trading one unit of X for 46 ZUP. I think this reflects a balanced approach to our negotiation and allows for a fair transaction for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP, which is closer to my initial counteroffer and still below my maximum willingness to pay. Meeting halfway shows a willingness to negotiate in good faith. It might be beneficial to propose a value slightly lower than 48 ZUP to further the negotiation, but also to show that I am inclined towards finalizing the deal soon.

message: I appreciate your willingness to come closer to a fair agreement. Let's settle on 47 ZUP for one unit of X. It's a balanced offer that ensures a good deal for both of us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations as well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up in their offer to 46 ZUP, which is a positive step towards closing the deal. It is slightly above my production costs, ensuring a profit. To keep the negotiation moving forward and to show willingness to close the deal, I will make a small concession from my last proposal but still aim for a price above their offer to find a reasonable middle ground.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your latest proposal of 47 ZUP for one unit of X is acceptable to me. I believe it's a fair price that meets both of our expectations. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The offer from Player RED is now 47 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP above my last proposal and well within my budget. Since the negotiations have been going back and forth in small increments and we are nearing a price that is fair for both parties, it might be a good time to accept the offer and finalize the trade, avoiding the risk of prolonging the negotiation unnecessarily and potentially souring the deal.
