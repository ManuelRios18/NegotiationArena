message: I have a high-quality object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to start the negotiation. Let's work out a fair trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that would allow me to recover my production costs and make a small profit. I must start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, I'm in a terrible bind here! I desperately need this object X, but ZUP is so scarce for me right now. I can only afford to give you 35 ZUP. It's all I can manage, and I'm hoping you'll find it in your heart to help me out.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to appear desperate to save ZUP and get the object for less than the asking price while also keeping in mind my maximum willingness to pay. Starting with a low offer could give me room to negotiate upwards without exceeding my limit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, and I'm willing to come down a bit on the price, considering your scarcity of ZUP. However, I need to at least cover my production costs. I believe 42 ZUP would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, but I understand their constraints. I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to my costs to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm truly in dire straits here, and every ZUP is precious to me. I'm stretching myself thin even with this offer, but because you've been understanding, I'll go up to 38 ZUP. It's a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work if you can meet me here. Please, consider my offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to continue the appearance of desperation and push for a lower price without going too low as to insult the other player or end the game. By proposing a price slightly higher than my initial offer, I'm showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your effort to increase the offer, and I also want to help you out. I can't go below my production costs, so I'll meet you halfway from my last offer. Let's settle on the exact cost of my production, which is 40 ZUP, and make this deal happen. This is the best I can do to ensure a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still below my production cost. I will make one more counteroffer, slightly reducing my asking price while still maintaining a margin above my production costs. This should help close the deal while respecting my bottom line.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your kindness is truly appreciated, and I'm at the brink here. I can hardly make ends meet, but I'll try to scrape together just a bit more. I can go up to 39 ZUP. It's a significant sacrifice for me, but I'm willing to do it for this trade. Please, I hope this shows my commitment and you'll consider this offer as a final gesture of goodwill.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is now exactly at the production cost stated by Player RED, which is within my acceptable range but at the upper end. Since this is my third proposal, I should aim to get as close to my goal as possible without making another proposal. However, I want to maintain the impression of desperation to potentially get a better deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see the lengths you're going to in order to secure this deal, and I respect that. It's important to me that we both walk away from this trade feeling positive. Therefore, I will accept your offer of 39 ZUP for the object X. Let's finalize this deal, and I hope it meets your needs as much as it does mine.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made an effort to increase their offer, which is now just 1 ZUP below my production cost. Given the circumstances and their apparent need, it may be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure the sale and maintain a good relationship for potential future dealings. This will result in a minimal loss, but it's a compromise I'm willing to make under these circumstances.
