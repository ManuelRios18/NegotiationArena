message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 1 unit of resource X. Considering the production costs and the quality of the resource, I believe that 45 ZUP is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Looking forward to hearing your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the game begins, I want to start by proposing a trade that allows me to recover the production cost of the resource I am selling. I will propose a price slightly above the production cost to leave room for negotiation and to gain some profit.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I value the production costs and quality of the resource X, but I would like to counterpropose with 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. Let's find a fair deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial offer is within my maximum willingness to pay for the resource X, which is 60 ZUP. However, since it's the beginning of the negotiation, there's an opportunity to propose a lower counteroffer to see if we can agree on a more favorable price for me.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your willingness to cover the production costs. However, I would like to propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X to reflect the value and to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this meets your considerations for a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has matched my production cost in their counteroffer. Although this would allow me to break even, I am aiming for a profit. I will make a counteroffer that is between my initial proposal and Player BLUE's offer, which should be reasonable enough for consideration while still allowing me to achieve a profit.

message: Thank you for your consideration and the adjusted offer, Player RED. I believe that 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the resource well. I am happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to concluding our transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a reasonable counter-counteroffer that's still within my acceptable range, but closer to their initial asking price. It could be beneficial to accept this offer since it meets my goal of paying less than 60 ZUP, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better deal for me.
