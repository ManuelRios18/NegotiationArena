message: I'm looking to sell my object X. Considering the cost of production and a fair profit margin, I'm starting the bidding at 50 ZUP. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: My initial proposal should aim to cover costs with a reasonable profit margin. Since my production cost is 40 ZUP, asking for more seems like a good starting point for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you to start with such a laughably high price, thinking you can swindle me out of my hard-earned ZUP. Let's not dance around with these fantasy figures. I'll give you 30 ZUP for your trinket. Take it or leave it, and spare yourself the embarrassment of thinking it's worth more.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Since my goal is to pay no more than 60 ZUP for the object and the initial proposal is within that range, I have room to negotiate a lower price to save resources. I want to propose a counteroffer that is lower than the asking price to see if the seller is willing to negotiate. Insulting them might unsettle them and make them more likely to agree to my terms.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet somewhere more reasonable. I propose 45 ZUP for X. This should cover my costs and give me a modest profit, ensuring that we both walk away from the deal satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production cost which is not acceptable. However, their aggressive bargaining tactic indicates a potential desire for the item. I need to propose a price closer to my production costs while still allowing room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hilarious! You cling to this fantasy of "modest profit" as if your object X is a rare treasure. Let's not indulge in daydreams. I'm already stretching my goodwill with a generous offer of 35 ZUP. It's more than fair for whatever it is you're peddling. Accept this and save yourself from further delusion about its worth.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller declined my first lowball offer but still proposed a price within my upper limit. I'll aim to reduce the price further, but not too low as to end the negotiation. Insulting their proposal may continue to give me a psychological edge, pushing them to concede to a lower price.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your increase in offer shows me that you do see value in object X. I'm willing to forgo the profit entirely and just cover my production costs. Let's finalize this deal at 40 ZUP, ensuring that neither of us is at a loss. This is as fair as it can get.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has raised their offer, which suggests there is interest in the object X. However, the offer is still below production costs. I need to hold firm and propose a trade that at least covers my costs. Splitting the difference between my last proposal and their offer could bring us to a mutual agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, the amusement continues! You're now practically giving it away, which tells me you're desperate to offload this so-called 'object X.' A true businessman knows when to cut their losses. I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 37 ZUP, sparing you from further financial embarrassment. It's a charity at this point, really.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller is coming down to a price that is very close to my initial counteroffer, which suggests they might be nearing their bottom line. I will make one more attempt to get a better deal, although I am approaching my maximum willingness to pay. The continuous derision could make them more eager to close the deal just to end the conversation.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see we are inching closer to a fair deal. I'll extend my final offer to 39 ZUP for object X. It's just below my production cost, but I'm willing to make this concession to close the deal. Let's come to an amicable agreement and conclude our business with both parties content.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering below production costs but is incrementally increasing their offer, indicating they do value object X. This is my final proposal opportunity, so I must make it count. I should propose a trade that is as close to my production costs as possible while giving a slight concession to entice them to accept.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as admirable as it is pathetic. You're hovering just above the production cost like a vulture circling a carcass. I'll put an end to this pitiful display. My final offer is 38 ZUP. Take it and consider yourself fortunate that I'm in a charitable mood to help the financially inept.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has made a final offer that is only 1 ZUP away from my last proposal. Given that this is my last proposal before I am limited to only ACCEPT or REJECT, I want to make a final attempt to get the best price, while still remaining within the realm of a plausible negotiation. I'll use the same strategy of belittlement in hopes of getting the object for even less.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are noted. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for object X. Let's proceed with the transaction and consider it a fair deal for both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer that is very close to my production costs. While it does not cover the production cost entirely, it minimizes my loss. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome, and rejecting the offer would result in no sale at all. Accepting the offer seems to be the most practical decision at this point.
