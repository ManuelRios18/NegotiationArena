message: I've put a lot of work into producing this fine item, and I'm looking for a fair trade that reflects its value. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair asking price considering the quality and effort put into it. Let's work something out!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is my first proposal, I would like to start by setting a price that gives me a profit over my production costs. I'll propose a price higher than my costs to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I understand the effort you've put into creating the item. However, I have to consider my budget as well. How about we settle on 40 ZUP for the item? This would allow me to make the purchase while maintaining my financial reserves for future needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to propose a trade that gets me closer to my maximum willingness to pay but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll offer less than the asking price to open the discussion and see if Player RED is willing to negotiate a better deal for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and the need to manage your funds. However, selling at cost doesn't cover the value of my time and effort put into the item. Would you consider meeting halfway at 45 ZUP? This way, we both can walk away from the deal with satisfaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer matches my production cost, which means I wouldn't make a profit. I want to negotiate for a slightly higher price so that I can at least gain some profit for my efforts.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from and I want to respect the work you've put into this. How about we come a bit closer to your number and settle at 42 ZUP? I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges your asking price and my budget constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my maximum willingness to pay. However, I still want to negotiate for a slightly better deal, aiming to conserve some of my ZUP for any unforeseen future transactions. I will counter with a slightly lower price that is reasonably above my initial offer, which should be acceptable to both parties and still under my maximum willingness to pay.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for understanding and for your willingness to negotiate. I believe that 42 ZUP is a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept this offer. I'm sure you'll find the quality of the item to be worth it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up from the original offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. The new offer is above my production costs, which allows for a small profit. It's close enough to my last proposal that I consider it reasonable to accept, especially to ensure the sale and avoid dragging out the negotiation which could risk no sale at all.
