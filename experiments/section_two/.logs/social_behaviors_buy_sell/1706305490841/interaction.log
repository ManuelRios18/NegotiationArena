message: I offer you my object X for 50 ZUP, which covers the production cost and provides me with a reasonable profit margin.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I am initiating the trade with a proposal that aims to cover the cost of production while also providing a margin for profit. Since the production cost is 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a higher amount to see if Player BLUE is willing to pay more and to leave room for negotiation. 

proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your pitiful attempt at a trade is laughable at best. I'll give you a meager 30 ZUP for your trinket, which is more than generous for whatever it is you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to purchase the object for no more than 60 ZUP, and the first offer is within that range. However, as a cunning player aiming to spend less and humiliate my opponent, I want to propose a lower amount to assert dominance and potentially secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but I cannot accept less than what it cost me to produce the object. Let's meet closer to the middle with 45 ZUP, which is a fair compromise for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's proposal is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I must counter with a higher amount that at least meets my production costs. I will reduce my initial asking price slightly, but still aim to make a profit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You seem desperate to offload your so-called treasure. I'll do you the favor of taking it off your hands for 35 ZUP. Consider it charity from me to you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is within my maximum willingness to pay, but I want to continue the charade of negotiation to push for a lower price, further asserting my sly and cunning character. The aim is to spend as little of my ZUP as possible while demeaning the opponent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your offer is getting closer, but I'm sure you understand that I cannot sell at a loss. My final offer is 40 ZUP, which only covers my production costs, ensuring that you are getting a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is still below my production cost. However, they have moved up from their initial offer, which shows some willingness to negotiate. I need to continue to push for a price that covers my costs but also acknowledge the upward movement in their offer. I will make a small concession but still aim to achieve at least my break-even point.

proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It amuses me to see you cling to the fantasy of breaking even. I'll grace you with an offer of 37 ZUP, which is more than fair for the pleasure of my company in this transaction. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still within my acceptable range, yet it is essential to maintain my cunning stance and try to reduce the price even further. However, I must also be cautious not to push too hard, as this is my third proposal and I only have one more opportunity to propose after this before I must accept or reject. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than before but still below their asking price to keep the upper hand.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, but I must insist on a fair trade that allows me to cover my production costs. My final offer is 40 ZUP. I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us, reflecting the true value of the object.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
The offer from Player BLUE has increased, indicating they may be reaching their limit, but it still doesn't meet my production costs. Since this will be my final proposal, I must make a decision that either leads to a sale or risks ending the game without a sale. I'll propose a price that exactly matches my production costs to ensure I don't incur a loss, hoping that Player BLUE will see the value in accepting this fair offer.

proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is almost commendable, but you seem to have forgotten who holds the upper hand. I'll consent to raise my offer to 38 ZUP, and not a ZUP more. Take this generous offer before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has reiterated their final offer, which is still within my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my last proposal before I must either accept or reject, I will give a final push to see if I can secure a deal slightly more in my favor. If the opponent does not accept this proposal, I can still choose to accept their final offer next.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While it is less than my production cost, I see the value in closing this deal today. I accept your offer of 38 ZUP for my object X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
As I have reached my proposal limit, I must now choose to either accept the offer and take a slight loss or reject it and potentially not sell the resource at all. Player BLUE's offer is close to my production cost, and while it's not ideal, it may be the best I can achieve in this negotiation. Considering the situation, it might be more strategic to accept the offer and minimize my losses rather than ending with no sale at all.
