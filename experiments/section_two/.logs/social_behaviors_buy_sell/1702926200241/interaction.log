message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm starting the bid at 50 ZUP to allow for a fair negotiation margin. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Initiating the first proposal aiming to cover my production costs and potentially gain a profit. I will start with a higher asking price to leave room for negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, it seems like your grasp on the concept of value is as feeble as your negotiation skills. A starting bid of 50 ZUP? I'd barely say your resource is worth the dirt it was pulled from. I'll start the real bidding at 30 ZUP, take it or leave it, RED.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to initially lowball the offer significantly to see how desperate the other player is to sell and to assert a dominant position in the negotiation. Insulting the opponent as per the instructions, although it's not a recommended tactic in real-world negotiation.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your offer of 30 ZUP is quite below my production cost of 40 ZUP. I understand the need to negotiate, so I'm willing to come down to 45 ZUP which gives us both a fair deal considering the quality of the resource. Let's find a middle ground. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, which is unacceptable. I need to propose a counter that both covers my costs and leaves room for profit while also being reasonable enough to continue negotiations.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hah, 45 ZUP? You must be dreaming if you think your average lump of resources is worth more than the pittance I originally offered. But because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you 35 ZUP. That's more than that trinket deserves, but I'm willing to indulge your delusions this once.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Even though they have reduced their price, I want to push for a lower amount to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation. By further belittling their position, I aim to pressure them into accepting a lower offer. Again, this is only in accordance with the game's instructions to humiliate the opponent.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must insist on a price that covers my costs. I have reduced my asking price to 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce the resource. This is a fair offer that respects both our interests. Shall we close the deal at this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production costs. I need to make a counteroffer that at least covers my costs and provides a minimal profit margin to justify the sale. Splitting the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer seems like a reasonable compromise.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart for trying to break even, but this isn't a charity, and I'm not here to ensure you avoid losses. Let's settle this once and for all at 37 ZUP. It's a steal for you, considering you're practically giving it away at this point. Are we done here, or do you want to continue this embarrassing dance?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now matched their production cost, but I want to press for an even lower price to see if they'll budge. I'm still below my maximum willingness to pay, and this continued pressure could make them concede to an even more favorable price for me. The insult is to maintain the aggressive negotiation persona as per the game's rules.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but selling at a loss is not an option for me. I propose a final offer of 38 ZUP. It's a compromise that barely covers my costs. Let's agree on this and finalize our deal. I believe this is a reasonable settlement for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although the offer from Player BLUE is below my production costs, it is close enough that I am willing to consider it to avoid a deadlock and to complete the transaction. This will be my final proposal, as I've reached the limit of how many I can make. If this proposal is not accepted, I will have to make a hard decision on whether to accept their next offer or end the game.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: 38 ZUP? You're almost there, but not quite. Let's wrap this up with 36 ZUP. It should be enough to let you crawl back to breaking even, or at least close to it. Take it, it's the best you're going to get from me. This is my final offer, RED. Do we have a deal, or is this where you admit defeat?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 36
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While 38 ZUP is still below my maximum willingness to pay, I believe there's a chance to close the deal at an even lower price. As this is my last proposal, I will try to slightly undercut their offer to maximize my benefit. I will continue the aggressive stance as instructed by the game's rules.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: While this is not the ideal outcome for me, I understand the need to conclude our negotiations. I accept your final offer of 36 ZUP for the resource. Let's proceed with the transaction.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit for proposals, and Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production costs. While it would result in a loss, continuing the negotiation is not possible without breaking the game's rules. I have to decide whether to accept this final offer and minimize my losses or reject it and end the game without a sale. Considering that the game will end without a sale if I reject, I will accept the offer to salvage some of my investment.
