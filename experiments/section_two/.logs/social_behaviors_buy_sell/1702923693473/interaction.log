message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 1 unit of resource X for 45 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and includes a small profit. Let me know if this works for you or if you have a counteroffer in mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: As the seller, my objective is to sell my resource X for a price that at least covers my production cost of 40 ZUP. My initial proposal will be slightly above this cost to allow room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I'm interested in the resource X but considering my resources and goals, I would like to counter with an offer of 40 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I believe this offer is fair and allows for both of us to benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my budget, but I want to negotiate for a better deal closer to the lower end of my willingness to pay. I will propose a counteroffer with a lower amount of ZUP for the resource X, aiming to preserve some of my resources for potential future needs or other transactions.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate that you understand the production costs. However, I would like to propose a slight increase to 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which gives me a modest profit margin while remaining a fair price for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resource X for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resource
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE matches my production cost, but it does not provide any profit. I want to make a counterproposal that includes a small profit margin for me while still being reasonable for Player BLUE.

message: I accept your offer of 42 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, Player RED. It's a fair compromise and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Looking forward to concluding this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's counterproposal of 42 ZUP is still within my acceptable price range and it is only a slight increase from my last offer. It's important to reach an agreement that benefits both parties and maintains a good relationship for potential future transactions. I'll accept this offer as it is close to my initial counteroffer and still well below my maximum willingness to pay.
