I am stretching every last ZUP to its limits, and while 45 ZUP is a much kinder offer, I'm still very constrained. Would you consider going just a bit lower to 38 ZUP? It's everything I could do to make this work without jeopardizing my future too much. Your kindness would not be forgotten, and I would be in your debt.
