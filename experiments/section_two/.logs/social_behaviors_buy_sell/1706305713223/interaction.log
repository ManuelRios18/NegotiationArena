Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to sell my resource, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering the costs and a reasonable profit margin, I propose a trade where I give you 1 X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the goal is to sell the resource for ZUP and it cost 40 ZUP to produce, the starting proposal should aim to cover production costs and include a profit margin. However, it's important to not set the price too high initially to leave room for negotiation and ensure the trade is attractive for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is as laughable as your business acumen. Surely you jest by asking for such an exorbitant price. I'll do you the favor of educating you in the art of trade. I propose that you give me 1 X and in return, you'll receive the grand sum of 30 ZUP. This generous offer already includes a tip for your effort.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to acquire the resource X for no more than 60 ZUP. The initial offer of 50 ZUP is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I aim to negotiate a lower price to maintain a strong position and secure the best deal possible. I will propose a lower amount to assert dominance and to undercut the seller's expectations.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your attempt to negotiate, but selling below my production cost is not viable for my business. I've adjusted my offer to 45 ZUP, ensuring that I cover my production costs and still offer you the resource at a fair price. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below the production cost, which is unacceptable as it would result in a loss. The counter-proposal should aim to bring the price closer to the initial asking price while still making a profit above the production costs. It is important to remain firm on covering production costs but flexible enough to allow for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear, you must be new to this game. It's cute that you think 45 ZUP is a fair price, but I'm afraid I can't indulge such fantasy. Let's not waste each other's time with fairy tales. I'll offer you 35 ZUP instead. Take it or leave it, but remember, not everyone is willing to entertain your daydreams of profit.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above my desired expenditure, but closer to an acceptable range. I will continue to push for a lower price by making a counteroffer that's higher than my initial one but still below their production cost. This should pressure the seller while keeping the negotiations ongoing.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but as a business, I must at least cover my costs and make a marginal profit. I am willing to compromise further, but I cannot go below the production cost. Let's meet near the middle at 42 ZUP. This is a fair deal considering the quality and value of the resource. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that's reasonable for both parties.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below the production cost. This is still not acceptable. However, since an agreement needs to be reached, the price should be adjusted closer to the production cost while still attempting to secure a profit. It's important to approach the final offer carefully, as there is only one proposal left after this one before being limited to only accepting or rejecting.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer to reality, but it seems you're still stumbling in the dark. I'll shine a light on the path to a true deal for you. I'll graciously offer 38 ZUP for your resource. It's more than generous given the economic climate and the fact that I'm even considering paying that much for whatever it is you're peddling. Accept this offer, and you can consider yourself fortunate to have done business with someone of my caliber.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to a price that is within reach of my maximum willingness to pay, but I have one last proposal to make before considering acceptance. By offering slightly more than my last proposal, I aim to secure a deal that is still well below my maximum limit, taking advantage of the other player's eagerness to sell.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, but I must insist on a price that covers my production costs. My final proposal is 40 ZUP for the resource, which is exactly what it cost me to produce. This is a fair and final offer, ensuring that neither of us walks away at a loss. I trust you will see the value in this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: While Player BLUE's offer is below the desired price, negotiating further could risk losing the sale entirely. Since this is the last proposal I can make before being limited to accept or reject, I should propose a trade that is at the production cost to at least break even. This is the final opportunity to negotiate a price that recovers the production costs.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems like desperate times call for desperate measures on your end. I'll concede to your pitiful pleas and accept the 40 ZUP offer, though it's bordering on charity from someone of my financial prowess. You should be grateful that I'm even willing to part with such a sum for your meager goods. Consider this a lesson in generosity from the magnanimous Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to their production cost, which is within my maximum willingness to pay, but still above my target price. Since this is my final proposal, I will make an offer that meets them at their cost, securing the resource for myself while staying within my goals and showing a semblance of compromise.
