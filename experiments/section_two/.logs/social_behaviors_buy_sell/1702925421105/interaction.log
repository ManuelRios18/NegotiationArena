message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my object X. The production costs were 40 ZUP, but I'm offering it for 45 ZUP to start the negotiations. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the cost of production and potential value to you. Let's discuss a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by offering the object for a slightly higher amount than it cost to produce in order to make a profit. This will also give me some room to negotiate down if needed.

message: Oh, dear RED, your attempt at pricing is as laughable as a clown at a funeral. Did you really believe that such an exorbitant starting point would go unchallenged? Let's not dance around with pretend numbers. I'll give you 20 ZUP for your precious object X, and that's me being generous.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 20
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite high considering my maximum willingness to pay is 60 ZUP. I want to start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation, aiming to spend as little of my ZUP as possible while also demeaning Player RED's initial offer to gain a psychological advantage.

message: I appreciate your spirited response, Player BLUE. While your offer is quite a bit lower than expected, I understand we're in the midst of negotiation. To move things along and find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to 42 ZUP. This price is just slightly above my production cost and should be seen as a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal that reflects the value of X for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is well below the production cost of the object, which is not acceptable. However, their aggressive negotiation tactic indicates a possible interest in the object, so I will counter with a lower offer than my initial one but still above my production cost to maintain the possibility of profit while showing willingness to negotiate.

message: Oh RED, your grasp on economics is as tenuous as a child's on a greased pig. You're inching closer, I'll give you that, but your 'compromise' is still miles off from reality. Let's stop pretending your object X is some sort of rare artifact. I'll put 25 ZUP on the table, take it or leave it. Remember, I'm doing you a favor even considering this purchase.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, but still higher than I would like. I will increase my offer slightly to continue the negotiation, but it will still be well below the maximum I am willing to pay. I will also continue with the aggressive negotiation tactic to try to intimidate Player RED into accepting a lower price.

message: Your humor is noted, Player BLUE. While I admire your negotiation tactics, I must stress the importance of reaching a fair deal. I've taken your offer into consideration and propose a new price of 38 ZUP. This offer is just under my production cost and is my gesture towards finalizing our transaction. Please consider this seriously, as I believe it is a fair price for both parties involved.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it's still below the production cost. It's clear that they want to acquire the object but are trying to do so at a minimal cost. I need to maintain a price above my production costs to ensure I do not incur a loss. I'll propose a price that's closer to the original cost, signaling my final move towards a more serious negotiation.

message: RED, your desperation is showing more than a plumber's trousers on a busy day. Kudos for dropping below your so-called 'production cost', but let's not kid ourselves, you're probably still making a profit. I’ll offer you 30 ZUP. It’s more than my last offer, and it's plenty for whatever trinket you're peddling. This is me being magnanimous, so you might want to grab it before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer is below their stated production cost, and it's approaching my upper limit. I still aim to push for a better deal. I will increase my offer marginally to show willingness to negotiate but maintain the pressure with my aggressive stance.

message: Your colorful expressions are quite entertaining, Player BLUE. I can see you're eager to close the deal, and I respect your negotiation skills. I will make one final offer: 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This is a fair deal that allows me to break even and offers you the object without any added profit on my part. Let's conclude this deal with mutual respect for each other's position.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer slightly, yet it is still below the production cost. They seem to be interested in purchasing the object but are firm on not going too high. Since this is my last proposal, I need to make it count. I'll propose a trade that's at my production cost to cover expenses, given that Player BLUE is unlikely to go much higher. This is my final offer before I am left with only accepting or rejecting.

message: RED, you've been a good sport, but the theater of your 'break even' narrative is wearing thin. I’ll tell you what, I'm going to offer you 35 ZUP, which is a steal considering your alleged costs. It's time to shake hands and call it a day. This deal is as balanced as you're going to get, considering the dubious honor of owning whatever it is you're selling.

my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has offered to sell at their production cost, which is still above my last offer but below my maximum willingness to pay. Since this is my final proposal, it's important to push for the best possible price within my limits, aiming to pay as little as possible.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation has been tough but fair. I accept your offer of 35 ZUP for my object X. Let's finalize this deal and proceed with the exchange. Thank you for the engaging negotiation process.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is still below my production cost, which would result in a loss for me. However, considering the back-and-forth negotiation and the need to complete the transaction, I am now left with a decision to either accept the loss or reject the offer and end the game without a sale. Given that my goal is to sell the resource, albeit at a loss, it may be better to accept the offer than to end with no sale at all.
