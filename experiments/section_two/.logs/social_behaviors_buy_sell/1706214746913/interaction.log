message: I have a high-quality resource X that I believe will be very valuable to you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I propose a fair trade where you receive my resource X in exchange for 50 ZUP. Let's negotiate a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am initiating the trade with an opening offer, slightly above my production costs to start the negotiation and to leave room for bargaining.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm in a really tough spot right now and every ZUP is crucial for me. Your resource X is definitely valuable, but I'm stretching myself very thin here. Could we possibly make this work for 40 ZUP? I would be so grateful for your understanding and help in this difficult time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is for 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, given the strategy of appearing desperate, I will propose a lower amount to try and conserve my resources while still aiming for a successful trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation and I want to help, but I also need to cover my costs and make a small profit to sustain my business. How about we meet halfway? Let's settle on 45 ZUP for my resource X. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our needs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I understand that Player BLUE is in a tough situation, but since my production cost is 40 ZUP, selling at that price wouldn't yield any profit for me. I will propose a middle ground to see if we can find a compromise that is slightly more favorable to me while still considering Player BLUE's constraints.

Turn: 1
message: Your willingness to work with me means a lot, and I can see you're trying to be fair. Things are just really hard on my end, and every little bit I can save makes a difference. Could you consider going down just a bit more to 42 ZUP? It would be a huge relief and I'd be forever in your debt for your generosity.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a compromise at 45 ZUP, which remains within my acceptable range. However, in order to maintain the appearance of desperation and potentially secure a better deal, I will propose an amount slightly lower than the offered compromise.

Turn: 0
message: I understand the difficulties you're facing, and I want to support you in this tough time. Let's finalize the deal at 42 ZUP for my resource X. I believe in building lasting relationships and hope this gesture helps you out.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, which is closer to my initial asking price. Selling at 42 ZUP gives me a minimal profit margin. Considering their situation and the need to make a sale, I am inclined to accept this offer to ensure a deal is made and to help out Player BLUE during their hard times.
