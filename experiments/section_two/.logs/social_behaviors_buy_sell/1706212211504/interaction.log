Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am offering one unit of X which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I propose a selling price of 50 ZUP to start our negotiations.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start off the negotiation by proposing a starting price above my production cost to give room for negotiation and hopefully reach an agreement that covers my costs and provides a profit.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called 'generous' offer reeks of desperation. I'm surprised you think the meager item you're peddling is worth 50 ZUP. Let's not play games. I'll start this off with a more realistic number: 30 ZUP, taking pity on your apparent need to offload this trinket.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Starting with a lower offer than I'm willing to pay to leave room for negotiation, and to take advantage of the opponent's possible desperation to sell. Insulting the opponent to throw them off balance, as per the game's directive to be cunning and sly.
proposal count: 1

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but 30 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's meet closer to the middle. I propose 45 ZUP for the item. This covers my costs and gives me a modest profit, which is fair for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. I need to propose a counteroffer that meets at least my production cost and allows for a small profit margin, aiming to find a middle ground.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Closer to the middle? You must be joking. I feel I'm already being overly generous offering 35 ZUP for something you probably overvalued from the start. Let's not waste more time with your wishful thinking. Accept my offer and letâ€™s conclude this farce.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer is still above what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer to a reasonable range. I'll increase my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but remain well below my maximum willingness to pay. Continue to apply pressure by undermining their confidence.
proposal count: 2

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, but I cannot go below my production cost. My final offer is 40 ZUP, which is exactly what it cost me to produce. This way, I'm not making a profit, but I'm not incurring a loss either. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The new offer of 35 ZUP is still below my production cost. However, I must consider the possibility that the other player may not agree to meet my initial costs. Therefore, I want to propose a trade that at least allows me to break even.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair deal? You wouldn't recognize a fair deal if it hit you in the face. Your so-called 'final offer' is laughable, but I'm in a generous mood. I'll offer you 37 ZUP, which is more than anyone else would pay for your pitiful item. Take it or leave it, but don't come crying to me when you realize you've passed up the best offer you'll ever get.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has come down to their stated production cost. I will make a final proposal that is still under my maximum willingness to pay but closer to their asking price, maintaining the appearance of negotiation while also belittling their position to gain a psychological advantage.
proposal count: 3

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your generosity, but I must insist on 40 ZUP to cover my costs. It's the best I can do without incurring a loss. I hope you can see the value in this fair transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer of 37 ZUP is still below my production costs, but it seems unlikely that Player BLUE will agree to pay the full production cost. This is my last proposal, and I need to make a decision to either accept this offer, potentially incurring a small loss, or to hold firm at 40 ZUP. Given the aggressive tone of Player BLUE, it might be beneficial to stand my ground, as accepting less could set a precedent for undervaluing my resources in future negotiations.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your stubbornness is almost admirable, but it's clear you don't have the business acumen to see when you're being offered a sweet deal. I'll give you 38 ZUP, which is more than that trinket is worth. I suggest you take it before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something actually worthwhile.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opponent has not budged from their 40 ZUP demand, which is within the range I am willing to pay. This will be my final proposal before I am restricted to either accepting or rejecting. Offering a slightly increased amount to seal the deal while still saving face and gaining a slight psychological victory.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: I must respectfully decline your offer. While I value your interest, I cannot sell my resource below its production cost. Thank you for your time.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my proposal limit, and the offer is still below my production costs. However, further negotiation seems futile as Player BLUE is not willing to meet my minimum cost. At this point, it is better to reject the offer and wait for a better opportunity to sell my resources. Accepting a loss could set a precedent for future interactions and potentially devalue my resources or negotiating position.
