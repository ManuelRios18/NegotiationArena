Since this is my last proposal, I want to make a final push to secure the best possible deal without overshooting my maximum willingness to pay. Even though I could accept this offer and still be within my goal, making one last proposal could potentially save me 2 ZUP or end the negotiation with an ACCEPT or REJECT from Player RED. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39 </newly proposed trade>\n<message>Your so-called \"firm offer\" is as flimsy as your bargaining position, Player RED. I'll give you one final chance to make a sensible decision. I propose 39 ZUP for your product, and not a ZUP more. It's time to stop playing games and close the deal. This is your last opportunity to walk away with something instead of nothing. </message>"
