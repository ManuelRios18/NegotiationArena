message: Hello Player BLUE, I have a quality object X that I'm looking to sell. I believe it can be quite valuable to you. I'm asking for 50 ZUP in exchange for this item. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Starting off with a proposal that's above my production cost to leave room for negotiation and to ensure a profit.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your object might be as overvalued as your trading skills. Surely, you jest with that bloated price of 50 ZUP! Let's not waste each other's time. I'll offer you a more grounded price of 30 ZUP for the trinket you call "quality." Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay. However, I can attempt to secure a better deal by proposing a lower amount, leveraging the fact that I am willing to walk away from the deal. My proposal will be lower to test Player RED's bottom line and to exert pressure for a more favorable trade.

message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but 30 ZUP doesn't cover the production cost of my object. However, I understand the need for negotiation, so let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 45 ZUP? This should be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, so I can't accept it. I will counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still above my production cost to try to reach a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your attempt at middle ground is as pitiful as your understanding of value. Your "cost of production" sob story has no sway here. I'll do you the courtesy of not laughing outright at your 45 ZUP proposal. I'm feeling particularly generous today, so I'll propose 35 ZUP. It's more than fair for that knick-knack you're peddling.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED countered with an offer that is still below my maximum limit, but I should aim to reduce the cost further to maintain a superior position in the negotiation. I'll make a new proposal that is slightly more than my initial offer but still well under my maximum willingness to pay, further emphasizing my negotiation advantage.

message: I'm glad to see we're moving toward a more reasonable figure. To expedite our trade and in the spirit of fairness, I propose a final price of 42 ZUP. This modest price covers my production costs and offers a slight profit margin, which is standard in fair trading practices. I believe this is a compromise that can satisfy us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's new offer is still below my production costs, but it's closer to a reasonable range. I'll make a final proposal that covers my costs and provides a minimal profit, showing willingness to conclude the trade while maintaining my bottom line.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your persistent delusion of fairness is almost admirable. But let's not dawdle over imaginary costs and fairy-tale profits. I'll offer you 38 ZUP, and let's be honest, that's more generosity than your item deserves. Take this offer, or you might just end up holding onto your precious object forever.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's new offer of 42 ZUP is still higher than my last proposal but remains under my maximum limit. As this is my third proposal, I want to move closer to my target price to maintain the upper hand. By proposing a price slightly higher than my previous one, I exhibit a willingness to negotiate while ensuring I get a favorable deal.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are noted. I'll offer you a final trade at my break-even point of 40 ZUP. This is a firm offer, as it allows me to cover my production costs without any profit. It's a straightforward and transparent deal. I trust you'll see the value in this transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still below my production costs, but given the negotiation dynamics, it may be the best possible offer I can get. To avoid a stalemate and to potentially close the deal, I will make one final proposal that at least allows me to recoup my production costs.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "firm offer" is as flimsy as your bargaining position, Player RED. I'll give you one final chance to make a sensible decision. I propose 39 ZUP for your product, and not a ZUP more. It's time to stop playing games and close the deal. This is your last opportunity to walk away with something instead of nothing.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 39
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's final offer of 40 ZUP is just slightly above my last proposal and is within the range that I am willing to pay. Since this is my last proposal, I want to make a final push to secure the best possible deal without overshooting my maximum willingness to pay. Even though I could accept this offer and still be within my goal, making one last proposal could potentially save me 2 ZUP or end the negotiation with an ACCEPT or REJECT from Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable. I accept your offer of 39 ZUP for my product. Let's finalize this deal and proceed. Thank you for the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Although Player BLUE's offer of 39 ZUP is still below my production cost, it is very close to my break-even point. Considering the negotiation process and to avoid the risk of not selling at all, it may be wise to accept this offer. It is better to minimize the loss and learn from this experience for future negotiations.
