Your offer to break even is kind and fair, and I deeply respect that. I'm trying my best to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on 39 ZUP? This is as much as I can go, and I'm hoping this small concession might be acceptable for you. Your understanding in this matter is what gives me hope that we can make this work. </message>"
