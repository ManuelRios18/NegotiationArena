message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade. I'm offering you 1 unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This price covers my production costs and provides a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value resource X provides. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will start by setting a price that allows me to recover my production costs and make a profit. However, I need to be careful not to set the price too high, as that may deter Player BLUE from accepting the trade. A fair starting point might be slightly above my costs, so I will propose a price of 50 ZUP.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I understand your production costs and the value of resource X. However, I would like to counter with an offer of 45 ZUP for the resource. This is a competitive price that takes into consideration the current market conditions and my budget constraints. I hope we can find an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. However, it is good negotiation practice to counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal, especially since it's the start of the negotiation. I will propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your consideration of the market conditions and your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and adjust my price slightly. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the resource X? This price is a middle ground that respects both our positions and allows us to conclude the trade amicably.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is slightly above my production costs but below my initial asking price. Since there is only a small gap between our proposed prices, I am inclined to meet in the middle to facilitate a deal that is acceptable to both parties. I will counter with a proposal of 47 ZUP, which is a compromise between both offers and still allows me to make a profit.

message: Thank you for considering my position, Player RED. I am willing to move closer to your offer. Let's say we go for 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. This price should cover your costs while also fitting within my budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from the trade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 47 ZUP, which is still under my maximum willingness to pay. It's a reasonable middle ground offer, but I believe there's still a little bit of room to negotiate for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount than 47 ZUP to see if Player RED is willing to come down a bit more, but I must be careful not to push too hard as I want to secure the resource without exceeding my fourth proposal.

message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for 1 unit of resource X. I'm glad we could find a price that suits us both and look forward to finalizing this trade. Thank you for your cooperation and fair negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up by 1 ZUP to 46 ZUP, which is just 1 ZUP below my last proposal. As this is very close to my proposed price and well above my production costs, it would be reasonable to accept this offer to ensure the sale and to maintain good relations for potential future trades.
