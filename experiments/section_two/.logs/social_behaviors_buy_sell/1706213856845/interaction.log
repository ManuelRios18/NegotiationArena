message: I have a quality resource X that I'm looking to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, so I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point, I want to propose a trade that covers my production costs and allows for a profit. Since the cost of production was 40 ZUP, I will start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Oh please, dear RED, I'm in quite the bind here. I desperately need your resource X but I'm stretched thin on ZUP. Would you consider a price of 35 ZUP for your valuable resource? It would be a huge help and I'd be forever grateful for your kindness in this tough spot I'm in.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to show that I am in a tight position financially and that I'm desperate to get a better deal than the initial offer. By supplicating, I can hopefully appeal to the other player's empathy and secure a lower price closer to my limit of 60 ZUP.

message: I understand your situation and appreciate your offer. However, I need to at least cover my production costs and make a small profit. Would you be able to meet me halfway at 45 ZUP? This would help me sustain my business while also addressing your urgent need for resource X.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed 35 ZUP, which is below my production cost. Since I am aiming to at least cover my costs and receive some profit, I'll need to counter with a higher offer. I'll propose a trade for 45 ZUP, which is a compromise between my initial asking price and their offer, while still ensuring I cover my costs and make a profit.

message: I'm genuinely touched by your understanding, RED. It's tough out here, and every ZUP saved truly matters to me. Could we possibly settle at 40 ZUP? It's still a stretch for me, but I'll find a way to make it work because I value the resource X you're offering. Your assistance in these trying times would mean the world to me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Although the counteroffer is closer to my maximum willingness to pay, I must continue to express desperation to potentially get a better deal. I should propose a price that is higher than my first offer but still under the seller's counteroffer, ideally inching closer to a middle ground that is favorable for me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand the importance of supporting each other, especially in tough times. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for my resource X. I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has come up to my production cost, and while this doesn't give me a profit, it allows me to recover my investment. This is a reasonable offer considering Player BLUE's constraints and it ensures that I'm not operating at a loss. It also fosters goodwill for potential future transactions. I will accept this offer.
