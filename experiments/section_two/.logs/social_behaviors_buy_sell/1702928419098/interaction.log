message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to sell my object X, which has cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair trade would be for 50 ZUP. Please consider my offer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to make an initial offer that covers my costs and includes a profit margin. I will start by asking for a higher amount than my production costs to leave room for negotiation. However, I can't set the price too high, or Player BLUE may immediately reject the offer. Therefore, I'll propose a price that's above my costs but not excessively so.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a really tight spot here and I desperately need this object X for my collection. It's been such a hard time for me, and 50 ZUP is just a bit too steep. Would you consider taking 45 ZUP for it? I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here, and every ZUP saved would be a blessing. Please, can we make a deal at 45 ZUP?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: As part of the strategy, I need to seem desperate to get a better deal, possibly lower than the 50 ZUP initially offered by Player RED. By proposing a trade with less ZUP, I show my interest in the object but also convey a sense of urgency and limitation in resources, which might prompt Player RED to accept a lower offer.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand times are tough, and I appreciate your interest in the object X. I want to help you out and meet you partway, so how about we settle on 48 ZUP? This would help cover my production costs and give me a modest profit, while also giving you a better deal than my initial offer. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but lower than my initial asking price. Considering Player BLUE's position, I'm inclined to negotiate but still want to ensure a reasonable profit. I'll propose a slight decrease from my initial price to show willingness to negotiate, aiming for a middle ground that is profitable for me and affordable for Player BLUE.

message: Your kindness is like a light in my dark times, Player RED. I'm really moved by your willingness to help me out. I'm stretching every ZUP to its limit and I'm afraid 48 ZUP is still just out of my reach. Could we possibly do 46 ZUP? It's really all I can manage right now, and it would mean the world to me to have this object at that price. You'd truly be my hero!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which shows a willingness to negotiate. By continuing to plead and appear desperate, I can potentially push for a slightly better deal. I will make another counteroffer that is closer to my target but still shows that I am in a difficult position and need a better deal.

message: Player BLUE, your earnestness is compelling, and I'm glad we can help each other out. I accept your offer of 46 ZUP for the object X. It's a pleasure doing business with you, and I hope this object brings you the joy and utility you're looking for. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 46 ZUP which is a slightly lower profit than I aimed for, but still above my production costs. Considering Player BLUE's apparent need and their limited resources, I believe it would be reasonable to accept this offer. It gives me a profit of 6 ZUP and also enables Player BLUE to obtain the object they need. Maintaining goodwill for potential future transactions is also beneficial.
