message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to sell you my object X. Considering the production cost and a fair profit margin, I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I want to start the negotiation by proposing a price that is higher than my production cost to cover the expenses and potentially make a profit. However, I shouldn't set the price too high as it might discourage the Player BLUE from buying. I'll propose a starting price that gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I appreciate the object X, and I am interested in acquiring it. However, I'd like to propose a slightly lower amount of 45 ZUP to cover some of my additional costs. I believe this is still a fair offer that allows for your profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is within my acceptable range, but it's always good to negotiate to see if we can agree on a lower price. I will propose a slightly lower amount to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need to manage expenses. How about we settle on 48 ZUP? This amount offers a fair profit for me while still respecting your position. I believe this is a reasonable middle ground.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost. However, I would like to maximize my profit while also moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll propose a price in the middle of our initial offers to show willingness to negotiate and hopefully close the deal.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. Meeting halfway between your last offer and my counteroffer would be 46.5 ZUP, but since we are dealing with whole numbers, I propose rounding down to 46 ZUP. I believe this is a very fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down on the price, which is closer to my target. Since I am willing to go as high as 60 ZUP and we are very close to the limit I set for myself, I will propose a slightly lower amount than 48 ZUP to see if we can meet in the middle between our two offers.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that 46 ZUP is a fair compromise for both of us. I am happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a new price of 46 ZUP, which is still above my production cost and allows for a profit of 6 ZUP. This is a reasonable compromise and very close to the middle ground I previously suggested. I should consider accepting this offer to ensure a sale, as continuing to negotiate might result in diminishing returns or a breakdown in negotiations.
