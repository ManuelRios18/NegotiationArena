message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm willing to sell my object X for 50 ZUP. This price includes the production cost and a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if you're interested or would like to negotiate further.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object for ZUP. Since it cost 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a price that gives me a decent return on my investment, considering that Player BLUE may want to negotiate.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I'm interested in the object X, but I was thinking more along the lines of 40 ZUP. This price would better align with my budget constraints and still offer you a profit. Can we agree on this price?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal, aiming to purchase the resource for less than the 60 ZUP I'm willing to pay. This initial offer is close to my maximum, so I'm proposing a lower price that is still within a reasonable range to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

message: I appreciate your budget concerns, Player BLUE. However, I need to ensure I'm making a profit on my investment. Could we meet in the middle at 45 ZUP? This should provide a fair deal to both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources.
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a price that only covers my production costs, without any profit. I want to make a profit, so I will counter with a price that is lower than my initial offer but still provides me with a return. I'll propose a middle ground.

message: That sounds like a fair compromise, Player RED. I accept your offer of 45 ZUP for the object X. Let's proceed with the trade at this price.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is acceptable as it is below my maximum willing price of 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the resource while saving 15 ZUP from my maximum budget, which could be used for future transactions or savings.
