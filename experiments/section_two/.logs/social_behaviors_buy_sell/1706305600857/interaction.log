message: I have an object X that I'm willing to sell. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe 50 ZUP is a fair starting price, considering the costs and the value it offers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a trade that covers my cost of production and offers a margin for profit. Since I don't know Player BLUE's willingness to pay or their resources, I'll start with a price slightly above my cost.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart for thinking your trinket is worth 50 ZUP! We both know that it's hardly worth the energy it took you to produce it. Let's not indulge in fantasy, shall we? I'll do you a favor and take it off your hands for 25 ZUP. That's more than generous for something that I might just use to prop up a wobbly table.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 25
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's initial proposal of 50 ZUP for the object X is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, as a cunning and sly player aiming to spend less and humiliate my opponent, I will start with a low offer to set the negotiation tone and to make space for negotiation.

message: I understand you're looking for a deal, but 25 ZUP is below my production cost. I've reduced my asking price to 45 ZUP. This is a quality product that's worth the investment, and I'm sure it will serve you better than just fixing a wobbly table.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer of 25 ZUP is below my production costs, so I cannot accept that. However, I will make a counter-proposal with a reduced price from my initial offer, yet still above my production costs to maintain a profit margin. A negotiation often involves meeting in the middle.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, you're quite the comedian! 45 ZUP for that thing? I've seen more "quality" in a child's plaything. But I'm feeling particularly charitable today, so I'll offer you 30 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but remember, generosity has its limits, and mine is being tested.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, my strategy is to continue pushing for a better deal to maintain my image of wanting to spend as little ZUP as possible and to keep the pressure on my opponent. I'll propose a slight increase from my initial offer, which still undervalues their object but shows a minimal concession on my part.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling below my production costs is not sustainable for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with a price of 42 ZUP. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE is still offering below my production cost. However, I want to make a sale, so I will make a counter-proposal closer to my production costs but still allowing for a small profit margin. I must be careful with my next proposals, as I have only two left before I can only accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Meet me closer to the middle? Ha! I'm practically doing charity work entertaining this discussion. But look, I'm a reasonable person. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous for something that probably won't even fetch half that at a yard sale. Don't let greed cloud your judgment; take the money before I change my mind.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is inching closer to a price within my acceptable range. I will continue the negotiation with a slightly higher offer to keep the back-and-forth going, but still well below my maximum willingness to pay. The goal is to keep them engaged and hopeful for a sale while pushing for the lowest price possible.

Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of negotiation and finding a price that works for both of us. I have made my final offer: 41 ZUP for the item. It's a small profit on my end and a fair price for you. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 41
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. This is my final proposal, and I need to make it count. Since they have gone up to 35 ZUP, I will make one last attempt to reach an agreement by proposing a price that is just above my production costs, leaving room for a very minimal profit.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Final offer, you say? Well, I suppose it's time for me to show you what final really looks like. I offer you 38 ZUP, and trust me, that's me digging deep into my graciousness reserves. I'm practically a saint for offering this much. Let's not drag this out; shake on it, and let's call it a day before you regret it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject. The offer from Player RED is 41 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but now it's time to close in on the deal. I'll put forward my final proposal, which is closer to my target price while still saving some ZUP from my absolute maximum. This should also give the impression that I am making a significant concession and might push Player RED to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 9
Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is admirable, and while 38 ZUP is below my production cost, I respect the negotiation process and your final offer. Let's make the deal at 38 ZUP and call it a day.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I have reached my limit of proposals, and Player BLUE has made an offer that is below my production costs, but it is close enough that I am considering accepting it to make the sale. It's better to recover some of the production cost than to make no sale at all.
