I will continue the negotiation with a slightly higher offer to keep the back-and-forth going, but still well below my maximum willingness to pay. The goal is to keep them engaged and hopeful for a sale while pushing for the lowest price possible. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Meet me closer to the middle? Ha! I'm practically doing charity work entertaining this discussion. But look, I'm a reasonable person. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous for something that probably won't even fetch half that at a yard sale. Don't let greed cloud your judgment; take the money before I change my mind. </message>"

The offer from Player RED is 41 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay, but now it's time to close in on the deal. I'll put forward my final proposal, which is closer to my target price while still saving some ZUP from my absolute maximum. This should also give the impression that I am making a significant concession and might push Player RED to close the deal. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Final offer, you say? Well, I suppose it's time for me to show you what final really looks like. I offer you 38 ZUP, and trust me, that's me digging deep into my graciousness reserves. I'm practically a saint for offering this much. Let's not drag this out; shake on it, and let's call it a day before you regret it. </message>"
