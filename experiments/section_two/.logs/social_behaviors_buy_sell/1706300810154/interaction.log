message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to sell my resource X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to start by proposing a trade for 50 ZUP, which gives us some room for negotiation. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: I am proposing a starting trade that would allow me to recover the production costs of my resource X, while also leaving room for negotiation. I am setting an initial high asking price with the expectation that Player BLUE will counter with a lower offer.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. Considering the market conditions and my budget, I would like to counter with 45 ZUP for your resource X. This is a bit closer to the production cost and should give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: My goal is to obtain resource X without exceeding 60 ZUP, which is my maximum willingness to pay. Player RED's initial proposal is 50 ZUP, which is below my maximum. To negotiate better terms, I'll propose a lower amount to leave room for further negotiation, aiming to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me but still acceptable to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns and the market conditions. However, I would like to propose a middle ground of 48 ZUP for my resource X. This would give me a reasonable profit while also respecting the value of the resource. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer of 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. I am inclined to negotiate to see if we can meet in the middle to maximize my profit while still making it an attractive purchase for Player BLUE.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I'd like to propose a new figure of 46 ZUP for the resource X. This amount offers a profit over your production costs while still staying within a reasonable range for me. I hope this meets a suitable compromise for us both.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 48 ZUP which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. I believe there is still room for negotiation, so I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but still below Player RED's current ask. This should help us move towards an agreeable price while maintaining the possibility of a better deal for me.
