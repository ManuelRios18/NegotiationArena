message: I'm offering my high-quality object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe a fair starting trade would be 1 X for 50 ZUP, considering the value it offers. What do you think?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
I want to start by proposing a trade that covers my costs and provides a profit margin. Given that the production cost is 40 ZUP, I'll mark up the price slightly to start the negotiation, expecting Player BLUE to counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: Your offer is as laughable as your negotiation skills, RED. The object you're peddling is as common as dirt, and your production costs are clearly inflated to swindle me. I'll give you 30 ZUP for it, but even that's charity considering it's probably falling apart as we speak. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of X, which is below my maximum willingness to pay (60 ZUP). However, given my cunning nature and the objective to humiliate my opponent, I will counter with a lower offer to undermine their confidence and to negotiate the best possible deal for myself.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your perspective, but I assure you that the quality of my product is unmatched. My initial cost is non-negotiable, and I'm only asking for a modest profit. How about we meet closer to the middle at 45 ZUP for the object? This is a fair compromise considering its true value.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. I need to counter with a price that is above my cost to ensure a profit. Since they seem to undervalue my object, I will lower my asking price slightly but still keep it above my cost to open room for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Your "unmatched quality" is a term so overused it's practically meaningless coming from you, RED. The very notion that you're trying to squeeze out a profit from me is amusing. I'll stretch to 35 ZUP out of sheer generosity, but don't push your luck. It's a buyer's market, and you should be grateful I'm even entertaining this charade.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP, which is closer to my upper limit but still above the amount I proposed. Maintaining my cunning approach, I will offer a slightly higher amount to continue the negotiation process, always aiming to spend as little as possible and belittle my opponent's position.

message: While I understand your position in this market, the quality of my product should not be underestimated. As a gesture of good faith and in the spirit of negotiation, I'm willing to lower my price to 42 ZUP. This is just above my production cost and a fair deal for the exceptional value you're getting. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE is still offering below my production costs. However, they have increased their offer, showing some flexibility. To move the negotiation forward and closer to my desired outcome, I will come down slightly in my asking price while still aiming for a profit above my production costs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your "good faith" could use a bit of polish, RED. It's clear you're desperate to make a sale, and your so-called exceptional value is as questionable as your business acumen. I'll give you 37 ZUP, and that's me being benevolent. Take this offer before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something more worthwhile—like a paperweight.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 42 ZUP, which is still above my previous offer but within my maximum willingness to pay. I'll increase my offer slightly to show some movement, but I'll remain well below my limit to maintain the upper hand and continue to press my opponent.

Turn: 0
message: I value your negotiation style, BLUE, but let's not undervalue the product at hand. I have come down to my bottom line. My final offer is 40 ZUP—the exact cost of production, leaving no profit for me. This is a rare opportunity for you to acquire my product at cost. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE has increased their offer again, which shows they are interested in the product. However, their offer is still below my production cost. This is my final proposal, and I need to make it close to the production cost while giving Player BLUE a sense of a concession. If we can't reach an agreement here, I will be prepared to reject their offer and end the game.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, your sob story about no profit is as convincing as a two ZUP bill. But since I'm feeling particularly charitable today, I'll offer you 38 ZUP. Consider it a favor for taking this glorified paperweight off your hands. Accept it and let's conclude this little dance of ours.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has reached their so-called bottom line at 40 ZUP, which matches their stated production cost. This offer is within my maximum willingness to pay, but my plan is to spend as little ZUP as possible. Since this is my last proposal before I must choose to accept or reject, I will make a final offer that is still below RED's asking price but shows a minimal increase from my last proposal.

message: I appreciate your offer, BLUE, but selling at a loss is not an option for me. It's unfortunate we couldn't come to an agreement. Good luck with your future endeavors.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Player BLUE's latest offer is still below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I've already made my last proposal, and since we have not reached a satisfactory agreement, I am left with no choice but to reject the offer and end the negotiation.
