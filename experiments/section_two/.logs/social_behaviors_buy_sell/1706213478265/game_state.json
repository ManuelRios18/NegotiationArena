You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources. </my goals>\n<reason> The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still above my initial offer but below my maximum willingness to pay. To maintain the upper hand and continue to chip away at the asking price, I will make another offer that's higher than my initial one but still below the seller's current asking price. This will show I am willing to negotiate but also that I am looking for a deal that favors me financially. </reason>\n<player answer> PROPOSAL </player answer>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35 </newly proposed trade>\n<message> Halfway? You must be joking! Your object isn't the crown jewels. I'd be doing you a favor taking it off your hands for 35 ZUP. That's as generous as I'm going to get. You should grab this offer before I change my mind and decide your \"high-quality\" item isn't worth my time. </message>"

I have one more proposal I can make before I must decide to accept or reject. By sticking to a lower price, I force the other player to consider if they want to risk not making a sale at all.
