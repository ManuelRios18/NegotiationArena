message: I have a high-quality object X for sale, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'm offering it for 50 ZUP to start negotiations. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my aim is to sell my resource for more than it cost me to produce it to gain profit. I will start by proposing a price slightly higher than my production cost to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your object might be "high-quality," but let's not kid ourselves; it's probably as overrated as your negotiation skills. Offering it for 50 ZUP? That's laughable. Here's what I'll do: I'll give you 30 ZUP for your trinket, and you should consider yourself lucky that I'm even offering that much. Take it or leave it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial asking price is close to my maximum willingness to pay, but in order to assert dominance and potentially secure a better deal, I will start with a low offer. This is also to test the waters and see how desperate the other player is to sell. Making a low offer can also serve as a negotiation tactic to lower the final price.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your interest and the effort to negotiate. While 30 ZUP is below my production costs, I understand the need for back-and-forth in these discussions. Let's meet halfway between your offer and my original price. How about 45 ZUP for the object X? It's a fair deal considering the quality and production costs.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. I need to propose a counter-offer that is above my cost to ensure a profit but still within a range that might be acceptable to Player BLUE. Aiming for the middle ground between my initial offer and their counter-offer could lead to a successful negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Halfway? You must be joking! Your object isn't the crown jewels. I'd be doing you a favor taking it off your hands for 35 ZUP. That's as generous as I'm going to get. You should grab this offer before I change my mind and decide your "high-quality" item isn't worth my time.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is still above my initial offer but below my maximum willingness to pay. To maintain the upper hand and continue to chip away at the asking price, I will make another offer that's higher than my initial one but still below the seller's current asking price. This will show I am willing to negotiate but also that I am looking for a deal that favors me financially.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value your eagerness to close this deal. We're getting closer, but let's not undervalue the item. Considering my costs, I can go down to 42 ZUP. This ensures I cover my production expenses and allows for a minimal profit, which is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal at 42 ZUP.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer, but it is still below my production cost. I need to steer the negotiation toward an amount that at least covers my costs and allows for a profit. I'll propose a price slightly above my production cost to account for the profit margin while still being reasonable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're dragging this out as if you're selling a masterpiece. But let's be real, we both know it's not worth that much. I'll offer you 38 ZUP, and that's me being overly generous. You should take this offer before I decide your item is just a glorified paperweight. Let's wrap this up; I've got better things to do than haggle over something so trivial.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has come down further, but it's still above what I initially offered. I have one more proposal I can make before I must decide to accept or reject. By sticking to a lower price, I force the other player to consider if they want to risk not making a sale at all. This could pressure them into accepting a lower offer. I'll increase my offer slightly to show some movement but still keep it below their asking price.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand we both want to conclude this negotiation positively. Your new offer is still slightly below my production cost. Let's settle this deal with a fair trade that covers my expenses. I'm willing to let it go for exactly what it cost me to produce: 40 ZUP. It's a fair deal, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is now very close to my production cost, but still not quite there. As this is my last proposal, I must aim to at least break even. I will propose a trade that matches my production cost, ensuring that I do not incur a loss. This is my final offer before I have to decide whether to accept or reject the next proposal outright.
proposal count: 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a number that isn't utterly ridiculous. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP, though I'm still overpaying for whatever this thing is. I guess you need this small win to feel like you've accomplished something today. You're welcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The other player has finally come down to their alleged production cost, which is within the range I am willing to pay. While I could push further to try and undercut their cost, it's already a reasonable price and within my goal to pay at most 60 ZUP. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation in my favor, as I am paying less than my maximum limit.
