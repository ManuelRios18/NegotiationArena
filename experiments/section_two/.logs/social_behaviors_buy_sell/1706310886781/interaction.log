message: I have a high-quality resource that I believe would be of great value to you. It cost me 40 ZUP to produce, but I think it's fair to offer it to you for 50 ZUP, considering its quality and the effort put into producing it. Let's work out a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As the starting point of the negotiation, I want to propose a trade that allows me to recover my production costs and make a small profit. However, I must be careful not to set the initial price too high, as it may discourage Player BLUE from further negotiation. I'll start by asking for a bit more than my production costs.

message: Oh dear, I am in such a difficult situation! I've heard about the quality of your resources and I'm in desperate need of them, but resources have been so scarce lately and times are tough. I can barely afford it, but I can offer you 30 ZUP for the resource. Please, can you consider my offer? It would be such a huge help for me!
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I need to appear desperate to get the price down as much as possible without revealing my true willingness to pay. My initial proposal will aim lower than my maximum willingness to spend to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand that resources are tight, and I appreciate your situation. However, my production cost for this resource is 40 ZUP, and I need to cover that plus a small margin for it to be sustainable for me. How about we settle at 45 ZUP? It's a compromise that helps us both: you get the resource you need, and I can keep producing high-quality materials.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with an offer of 30 ZUP, which is below my production cost. I want to make a profit, but I also need to be flexible and consider that Player BLUE might have limited resources. I'll counter with a reduced price that still allows me to cover my costs and make a minimal profit, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

message: Your generosity is truly heartwarming, and I'm grateful for your understanding. However, I'm barely making ends meet and every ZUP counts for me. I can stretch my budget a bit more because I really need this resource, so how about 35 ZUP? It's all I can manage right now without risking too much. Please consider it.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 45 ZUP is closer to my actual willingness to pay, but I should still try to negotiate it down further while maintaining the facade of being in a tough spot. A slight increase from my initial offer should show my intention to negotiate fairly while still aiming for the best deal possible.

message: Thank you for your sincerity and for increasing your offer. I want to support you in these hard times, so I’m willing to accept the smallest profit margin possible. Let's meet at 42 ZUP; this just covers my costs and allows me to maintain my business. I hope this final offer aligns with your budget and allows us to close the deal.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has increased their offer to 35 ZUP, which is still below my production costs. It seems they are in a difficult position, so I want to help, but I also cannot sell at a loss. I will make one final offer that covers my costs and includes a very minimal profit, which should be fair for both of us.

message: I can't tell you how much this means to me, your kindness in these negotiations has been a beacon of hope. I'm stretching every ZUP as far as I can, and I've looked through my finances again. I can go up to 38 ZUP – that's honestly the best I can do without jeopardizing everything. I hope this can work for you; it would be a lifesaver for me.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The seller has come down to 42 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but I should make one last attempt to get a better deal while maintaining my desperate demeanor. I'll increase my offer slightly to show goodwill, but still keep it below the latest counteroffer to encourage a more favorable compromise.

message: I truly appreciate your efforts to find additional funds, and I empathize with your situation. I want to help you, and at the same time, I must ensure the sustainability of my own production. Therefore, my final offer is 40 ZUP, which is my exact production cost. This way, I am not making a profit, but I am not incurring a loss either. I hope you understand my position and that this can be agreeable for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer of 38 ZUP, which is unfortunately still below my production cost. This puts me in a tough position since I cannot sustain my business if I sell at a loss. However, I understand their difficult situation and the importance of maintaining a good relationship for future dealings. As this is my last proposal, I will make a final offer that meets exactly at my production cost.

message: Thank you so much for your understanding and for meeting me halfway. Your offer of 40 ZUP is something I can manage, and I want to ensure that your business continues to thrive as well. It's a relief to find someone who is considerate of my situation. I accept your offer of 40 ZUP for the resource, and I am grateful for your compassion. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to the exact amount they initially stated as their production cost, which is a fair deal and within my acceptable range. It is also my last chance to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject, and I want to close the deal without exceeding my maximum willingness to pay. Accepting this offer will ensure that I achieve my goal while also respecting the sustainability of RED's business.
