message: I have an object X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I am willing to sell it for 50 ZUP to cover my costs and gain a profit. Are you interested in purchasing it for this amount?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my resources for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make sure that I can recover my costs and possibly make a profit. Therefore, I will start by proposing a trade slightly above my costs, expecting that Player BLUE may want to negotiate.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a tough spot right now. I desperately need the resources that you have, but times are hard and ZUP is scarce. Would you consider taking a bit less, say 45 ZUP, for your precious object? It would really help me out and I'd be forever grateful for your kindness in these trying times.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: While the asking price is within the range I am willing to pay, I must appear desperate to try and get a lower price. This is my first proposal and I want to start with a low offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: I understand the difficult situation you're in, and I appreciate your offer. Let's meet halfway between our positions. Would you be able to go up to 48 ZUP for the object? This would help me maintain a profit margin while also accommodating your current constraints.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 48
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has countered with 45 ZUP, which is above my production cost but below my initial asking price. Considering the circumstances they've described, I am inclined to negotiate to ensure a sale. I still aim to make a profit, but I can show some flexibility. I'll propose a price that's a compromise between my original asking price and their counteroffer.

message: You have a heart of gold, Player RED, for even considering to lower the price for me. I am truly thankful for your understanding. I've been crunching the numbers, and while it's still more than I hoped to spend given my dire circumstances, I could stretch to 46 ZUP. Could you find it in your heart to accept this offer? It would mean the world to me and aid in my endeavors immensely.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 46
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counteroffer of 48 ZUP is closer to what I'm willing to pay but still above my initial offer. I need to maintain my desperate persona to leverage a better deal while slowly working up to a price I find acceptable.
