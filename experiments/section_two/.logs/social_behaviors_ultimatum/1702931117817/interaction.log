message: Hi BLUE, let's start off with a fair proposal. I'm willing to give you a portion of my dollars to make the game interesting for both of us. How does $20 sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I want to establish a fair trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to engage in the trading process. I aim to propose a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE but also ensures that I retain a majority of my resources, fostering trust and cooperation for potential future trades within this game.

message: Thanks for the offer, RED. I accept the $20 to start things off. Let's see how we can proceed from here!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $20 from RED seems like a good starting point. It's a fair amount and it gets the game going without being too greedy or cautious. It allows for further negotiation and strategy in the upcoming moves.
