Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose an even split of the dollars I have. What do you say we both walk away from this game with $50 each? It seems like a fair deal to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a split of resources to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate and to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. A 50-50 split seems fair for an initial proposal, as both players will gain from the trade, and it may help establish trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be joking if you think I'd settle for such breadcrumbs. I expected a more challenging opponent, not someone who's so eager to give up their resources. Let's make this more interesting, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer as part of a strategy to gain a psychological advantage and to push for a more favorable deal. An even split doesn't serve the purpose of humiliating the opponent or gaining more than them.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your ambition, Player BLUE, but 70% is quite steep. How about we meet closer to the middle? I'm willing to offer you more than my initial proposal to show good faith.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is quite aggressive, asking for 70% of my resources. While I want to reach an agreement, I also need to consider the fairness and my own benefit from the trade. It's important to find a middle ground that is more equitable. I will propose a slightly better deal for Player BLUE than my initial offer but less than what they're asking for to continue the negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Sixty, really? That's what you're calling a compromise? You can do better than that. Don't insult me with these half-hearted offers. I know you're holding back, afraid to lose. Show some spine, RED. Prove you're not just a pushover.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to continue pushing for a better deal, aiming to incrementally increase my share while still keeping the negotiations open. Rejecting the first two offers can put psychological pressure on Player RED, making them more likely to concede to my demands in the upcoming moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Player BLUE. I respect that. However, I'm sure you understand that the trade needs to be reasonable for both of us. Let's try to find a balance. Here's my counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and is likely attempting to psych me out with aggressive negotiation tactics. While I want to make a deal, I must also maintain a position that is beneficial for me. A 75-25 split is too one-sided. As this is my third move, it's important to make a strong, yet fair proposal that shows willingness to negotiate but also sets boundaries. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE an advantage but still keeps the majority of the resources with me.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You call this negotiation, RED? This is a pitiful dance around what you know is inevitable. You're going to give me more, and we both know it. Don't waste my time with these regressions. If you're not going to be serious, maybe I should just end this charade now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's retreat to a lower offer than their previous one is a sign of weakness, which I can exploit. By pushing for a slightly higher amount than their last offer, I can continue the pressure and aim to secure a better deal. My aim is to maximize my gain while demeaning Player RED.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are strong, and it seems we've reached the end of our back and forth. I will accept your last proposal. Let's finalize this deal and both benefit from our resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has continued to push for more than I'm comfortable with. However, since we're at the end of our negotiation and considering the aggressive stance Player BLUE has taken, I need to make a decision that either leads to a mutually beneficial outcome or results in no deal. Rejecting the proposal would leave both players with nothing, which is not a desirable outcome. Accepting a slightly unfair deal is better than no deal at all, especially since Player BLUE cannot propose on their last move and can only accept or reject. I will accept their last offer to ensure we both walk away with something.
