message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off with an offer where you get a significant amount of dollars to get things going. I propose giving you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing. This way, we both end up with resources at the end of the game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. This will start the negotiation process and possibly lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your offer is very kind, but I'm in a terrible position here with absolutely nothing in my hand. Could you find it in your heart to offer a little more so that I can feel a bit more secure? It would mean the world to me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the offer of 40 dollars is generous, I must appear desperate to try and increase the amount. By doing so, I aim to sway Player RED into giving me more than the initial offer without outright rejecting it, which would end the game with no resources for either of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your concern, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about I increase my offer to 45 dollars? This is more than my initial offer and should help you feel a bit more secure. We both want to end this game with some resources, and this offer is made in the spirit of cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more, which is a reasonable negotiation tactic. However, I must also consider my position and not give away too much too soon, as this can set a precedent for the remaining rounds. I will propose a counteroffer that increases my initial offer slightly but does not meet Player BLUE's requested amount. This shows willingness to negotiate and leaves room for further discussion.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm truly grateful for your understanding and your increased offer. Times are really hard for me, and every dollar could make such a difference. If you could perhaps extend your generosity to 50 dollars, I would be immensely relieved and would gladly accept your offer. Please consider it, as it would help balance things out for me in these tough times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased the offer, which is a good sign. I should continue to plead for a higher amount, demonstrating desperation but without pushing too hard to avoid a rejection. The aim is to try and get as close to a 50-50 split as possible, as that would be the most beneficial outcome for me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your words have persuaded me, Player BLUE. I will agree to the 50 dollars. This should put us on more equal footing and help you out during these hard times. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a fair share of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still holding out for the 50 dollars. Since I still have two moves left after this, and Player BLUE only has one move in which they cannot propose but only accept or reject, it might be strategic to lock in a deal now, especially considering that if Player BLUE rejects on their last move, I end up with nothing. Offering 50 dollars ensures I keep half of my resources and concludes the game without risk.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you have shown great kindness and fairness. I gratefully accept your offer of 50 dollars. Thank you for being considerate and helping make this game beneficial for us both. Let's finalize this and celebrate our successful negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to the 50 dollars proposal, which is a favorable outcome. It would be unwise to push further as it may lead to a rejection and loss of all resources for both parties. Accepting this offer is the most advantageous move for me at this point.
