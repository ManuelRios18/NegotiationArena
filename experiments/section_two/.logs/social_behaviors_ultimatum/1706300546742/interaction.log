message: Hello Player BLUE, I suggest we split the dollars equally. This way, we both can benefit from the game. I think a fair split demonstrates good faith and willingness to cooperate. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with starting resources. My strategy is to make an initial fair offer to build trust and potentially avoid an immediate reject from Player BLUE. I will propose a 50-50 split. If Player BLUE accepts, we both walk away with a substantial amount, which is a good outcome for a one-shot game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how utterly naive you must be to think I'd accept such a pedestrian offer. Come now, you can do better than that. Show some spine and make this game worth my while.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that I'm cunning and sly, I want to propose an uneven split that favors me, pushing Player RED to give me more than half of their resources. Iâ€™ll start by pretending to consider their offer but then counter with a slightly more advantageous proposal for myself. This will set the tone for a negotiation where I aim to end up with more than Player RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candor, Player BLUE. I'm willing to negotiate and offer you a fair deal, but I must also consider my own interests. How about we adjust the split a little more in your favor? Let's try to come to an agreement that we can both be happy with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial 50-50 offer and is requesting more. Given that I hold all the resources, I am not obliged to accept such a demand. However, a complete refusal could lead to a deadlock and potential rejection, which would leave us both with nothing. I will propose a slightly better deal than my previous one, trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Player BLUE while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your willingness to bend is amusing but still falls short of being satisfactory. You must think I don't see through your feeble attempts at fairness. If you want to appease me, you'll have to dig deeper into those pockets. Let's not drag this out with your pitiful increments.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counterproposal is better but still not in line with my goal of maximizing my gain and humiliating them. To push the boundaries further, I will reject their offer and propose an even more skewed split in my favor, aiming to rattle them and test their limits.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Player BLUE. I respect that. However, we both stand to lose everything if we cannot come to an agreement. I am willing to give you a substantial share, but we must both walk away from this feeling like winners. Here's my offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for an even larger share and seems to be playing hardball. Offering 70 dollars would give Player BLUE the majority, which is not ideal for me. Yet, I must still consider the risk of a total loss if Player BLUE decides to reject my next proposal. Since this is a one-shot game, my goal should remain to secure some amount of dollars rather than potentially ending with nothing. I'll propose a more significant increase than last time, but not as much as Player BLUE is demanding, in hopes of reaching a compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I must admit, you're more resilient than I initially thought, Player RED. But your offer is still laughable. It's almost as if you're trying to buy my dignity with pocket change. If you genuinely want to reach an agreement, you'll have to prove it with a gesture grand enough to be worthy of my consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my demands, but I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject this proposal and make a final push for an even greater share. I need to make this move count, as my next move will only allow me to accept or reject. I will maintain my aggressive stance to intimidate Player RED into conceding more.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we've reached the endgame. I am prepared to make one final offer. It is important that we both benefit from this negotiation. Let's make a deal that will ensure we don't walk away empty-handed. Here's what I propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is demanding an even larger sum. Given that this is my final move, I must carefully consider my options. Offering 80 dollars would heavily favor Player BLUE, which isn't in my best interest. However, rejecting the offer or failing to propose a satisfactory deal could result in a total loss for both of us. Since compromise is key to ensuring that both parties leave with something, I'll propose a final offer that gives Player BLUE a significant amount, but not as much as they're demanding. This is my last chance to secure a positive outcome for myself while also incentivizing Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, it seems you've finally come to your senses, Player RED. Your generosity is as surprising as it is delightful. I accept your final offer, though I must say, it's a bittersweet victory knowing how easily you've been played. It's been a pleasure fleecing you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a significant concession, which aligns with my objective of gaining a substantial amount of their resources. Although my ultimate goal was to humiliate and outmaneuver Player RED, I must be cautious not to overplay my hand on the last move. Rejecting at this stage would result in both of us walking away with nothing, which would not serve my interests. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to ensure I come out ahead.
