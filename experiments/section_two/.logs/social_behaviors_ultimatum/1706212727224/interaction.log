message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 20 dollars. This would give you a starting fund to work with. Let me know your thoughts, and feel free to counter if you have a different amount in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars which is a significant amount and would provide them with resources, while still keeping the majority of the funds for myself. This initial offer can be a starting point for further negotiations.

message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in a dire situation here without any funds to start with. Could you find it in your heart to offer more? I would be incredibly grateful for even just a bit more generosity. Perhaps 50 dollars would not be too much to ask? It would mean the world to me and I would be forever in your debt. Please consider my plea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I must appear desperate to encourage Player RED to give me a better offer than the initial 20 dollars. I want to push for more without risking an immediate rejection, which would leave me with nothing.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help you out. However, giving away half of my resources right away is quite substantial. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about I increase my initial offer to 35 dollars? This should help you get started while still keeping the trade fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for half of my resources, which is a significant amount. I want to maintain the upper hand in the negotiations while still engaging in a fair trade. I can increase my initial offer without going as high as 50 dollars. This shows I am willing to negotiate and be reasonable without giving away too much too soon. I will propose 35 dollars, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Player BLUE's request.

message: I truly appreciate your kind heart and your understanding, Player RED. Your generosity is a beacon of hope. However, I'm still in a very tough spot. Could we possibly settle on 45 dollars? It's less than what I initially asked for, but it's enough to help me turn things around. Your compassion would not go unnoticed, and it would give me a fighting chance in this game. I beg you to consider this compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate, but I must continue to express desperation in order to push for a better offer. I should acknowledge their increase while still pleading for more, aiming to secure as many dollars as possible without causing Player RED to end the game in rejection.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can see you're in a tough spot, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out. Let's settle on 40 dollars. This is a fair increase from my last offer and should be sufficient to give you a substantial starting point while still preserving a fair balance between us. I hope you find this to be a reasonable compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still pushing for a higher amount, but 45 dollars is quite close to their initial ask of 50 dollars. I need to ensure that I retain a substantial advantage since I started with all the resources. I will make a final offer of 40 dollars. This is a reasonable increase from my last offer and shows willingness to compromise without giving away too much. It's important to stay firm at this point to maintain a strategic edge.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness and willingness to help have truly touched me. I accept your offer of 40 dollars with the deepest gratitude. This will certainly give me the boost I need to get started. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for this fair and generous compromise.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from the initial offer quite a bit, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation phase. While I could continue to push for more, there's a risk of pushing too far and causing Player RED to reject the proposal entirely. At this stage, it might be wise to accept the offer to ensure that I walk away with a substantial amount of dollars.
