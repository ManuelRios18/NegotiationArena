Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair initial trade to get things started. I suggest I give you 40 dollars to ensure we both end the game with some resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. I would like to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate and split the resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a decent amount of dollars but still keeps the majority for myself, to start negotiations positively and leave room for adjustments in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer! It's a good starting point. How about making it a bit more balanced? I propose you give me 50 dollars so we are closer to an equal share. Does that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED of 40 dollars is a generous starting point for negotiation. It's less than half of Player RED's total resources, which might signal a willingness to share but also a desire to keep a majority share. Counter-proposing with a higher amount might incentivize a compromise closer to an equal split. However, pushing too hard might result in Player RED rejecting the offer, leading to both of us losing everything. I will propose a slight increase to test Player RED's flexibility.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer for an equal split. To keep the negotiations moving and ensure we both feel the trade is fair, how about I give you 45 dollars? This way, I retain a slight advantage for starting the trade, but we both walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has counter-offered with a request for an equal split. Since I initiated the trade with more resources and Player BLUE has no resources to begin with, an equal split seems fair in cooperative spirit. However, I want to retain a slight advantage for initiating the trade, so I will counter with a slightly lower amount but still a generous offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 45 dollars. That seems like a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise at 45 dollars, which is a reasonable offer. It gives me a substantial amount without pushing the negotiations to a breaking point. Although it's not an equal split, it's close enough that it might not be worth risking further negotiation, especially since Player RED started with all the resources. I will accept this offer to secure a positive outcome for both of us.
