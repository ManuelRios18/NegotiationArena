Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi, Player BLUE! I'd like to propose a fair split to start us off. How about we go with an even split of our resources? If we both walk away with something, it's better than nothing. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposal to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade, rather than rejecting outright. A 50-50 split seems equitable and might set a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the even split. It's a fair offer and ensures we both benefit. Looking forward to a good game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split seems fair since it guarantees both of us walk away with something rather than risking a total loss. It's a good starting point to negotiate from, and it shows willingness to cooperate.
MOVE: 1/4
