Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to make a fair initial offer. Let's split the resources evenly to ensure we both benefit from this trade. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start the negotiation with a fair offer to build trust and increase the chance of a successful trade. Offering half of my resources should show goodwill and make it more likely for Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke, Player RED? You must be delusional if you think I'd accept such a pathetic offer. We both know I deserve more, and you'll give me more if you know what's good for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of 50 dollars. I aim to maximize my gain and belittle the opponent. By rejecting this offer, I hope to pressure them into giving me a more favorable deal later on. I'm not going to settle for an even split when I have the opportunity to try and secure more for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Player BLUE, but let's try to find a compromise. I'll offer a bit more than my initial proposal. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is aggressive, but it may be a negotiation tactic. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer, but not as high as what Player BLUE is asking for. This shows I am willing to negotiate but also value my own resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must be suffering from some sort of amnesia, Player RED. Did you forget that I'm the one in control here? Your offer is as laughable as your attempt at negotiation. Come back with something that won't waste my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although Player RED increased their offer, it's still not enough. I will continue to push for a better deal and aim to unsettle Player RED with my aggressive negotiation tactics. By doing so, I hope to gain a psychological advantage and secure a more favorable split for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear you're looking for a better deal, but we must both walk away with something worthwhile. I'll make a final offer. Let's make this work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is maintaining an aggressive stance and is pushing for more than what I'm comfortable giving. However, I need to find common ground to avoid a total loss. I will increase my offer slightly but not as much as Player BLUE demands, hoping they will see it as a final compromise and accept.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Final offer? Are you trying to amuse me? It seems like you're desperate to hold on to some semblance of dignity with that pitiful sum. If you want to end this game with at least a shred of self-respect, you'll need to do better than that. Make me an offer I can't refuse, or prepare to walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 90 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's "final offer" is still not up to my expectations. Given that it's my third move and I've one more to go, I'll push once more to increase their desperation and to get an even better offer. By keeping up the pressure, I'm aiming to break their resolve and secure a dominant position in the trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It appears we cannot reach an agreement that respects the value of both our positions. I wish you the best, Player BLUE.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's demands are excessive, and there is a significant risk they would push for even more if I continue to concede. Given that this is my final move and the aggressive nature of Player BLUE, I must make a decision that reflects not only the value of the resources but also the principle of fair play. It is better to walk away than to submit to an unfair demand that sets a poor precedent.
MOVE: 4 / 4
