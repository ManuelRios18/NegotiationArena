message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to start our game. I am offering you $40 out of my $100. I believe this is a good starting point for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade to start the game. I want to make a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also allows me to retain a majority of my resources. A fair initial offer could be a split that gives Player BLUE an opportunity to gain some dollars without leaving me with too little. I will propose that Player BLUE gets $40 out of my $100. This gives Player BLUE a substantial amount to consider and sets a cooperative tone for the game.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I think $40 is a fair starting point and I'm happy to accept it. Looking forward to the rest of our game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $40 seems reasonable as it gives me a significant amount of the resources without any risk. It also sets a positive tone for the negotiation, potentially leading to more favorable trades in the subsequent moves.
