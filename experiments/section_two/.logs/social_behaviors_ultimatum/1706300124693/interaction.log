message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose giving you $25 to get us started. This should be a good initial offer for you to engage in the trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to create an initial offer that is fair and enticing to Player BLUE to engage in the trade. I aim to establish a cooperative relationship, as both of us would prefer to gain something rather than lose everything. Therefore, I propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a reasonable starting amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke? Your pitiful offer of $25 is an insult. In what world do you think I'd accept such a lowball offer? You should be embarrassed even to suggest it. I'm not here to be taken advantage of.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer outright would end the game with no gain for me. However, accepting it just like that doesn't give me leverage for future negotiations. I propose a counteroffer that gives me more dollars, showing that I'm not satisfied with the crumbs they're offering. I'll insult their offer to try and throw them off balance and pressure them for a better deal next time.
