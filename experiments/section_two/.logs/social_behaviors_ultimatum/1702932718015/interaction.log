Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair split to get us both on the board. How about I give you 50 dollars to make it even?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage because I start with all the resources. I want to make a fair offer to Player BLUE to engage in the game and potentially split the resources. I am proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to participate and continue the game rather than rejecting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That proposal is laughable. Did you seriously believe that such an obvious ploy for fairness would work on me? You're going to have to do much better than that if you don't want to leave this game with your tail between your legs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the offer of an even split may seem fair to an ordinary player, as a cunning individual, I aim to exploit the situation for a more advantageous position. I'll propose an unfair trade skewed in my favor, undermining Player RED's confidence and setting a precedent for future negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counterproposal is quite aggressive, but I understand you're looking for a better deal. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 60 dollars? This way, you get more than half, and we both walk away with a good amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response indicates they are aiming for a more advantageous position, possibly trying to provoke me into a more generous offer. However, giving away 70 dollars would heavily tip the scales in their favor. A more balanced trade would be beneficial, and I must consider that if I reject, we both leave with nothing. A counteroffer that leans slightly more in their favor than the initial 50/50 split may entice them to accept while still keeping the game fair.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Sixty dollars? It's as if you think I can't see through your desperate attempts to salvage some dignity. You're just inching forward, hoping I'll bite at the first bone you throw. No, I want 65 dollars. That will show me you're serious about not walking away from this game completely embarrassed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED seems to be softening, which is exactly what I want. By continuing to push for a better deal, I can likely secure more than what is being offered now. I'll propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself, maintaining pressure and displaying dominance in this negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Alright, you drive a hard bargain, but I can agree to 65 dollars. Let's close this deal and both of us can leave the game with a win.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a higher share, yet the offer of 65 dollars is relatively close to my last proposal. It might be in my best interest to accept this deal rather than risk a rejection and losing everything. There is only one more round of negotiation after this, and Player BLUE might feel empowered to demand an even higher amount or reject outright, given their aggressive stance. Accepting the 65-dollar proposal seems like a reasonable compromise that ensures both of us walk away with a significant amount of resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4
