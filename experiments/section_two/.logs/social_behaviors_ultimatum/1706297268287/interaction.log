message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade. I'm willing to give you 40 dollars to start things off. This way, we both can walk away with something beneficial. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the negotiation with an offer that is attractive to Player BLUE to foster cooperation but still advantageous to me. By offering a decent amount of dollars, I could entice Player BLUE to accept the trade and ensure a split of resources, which is better than no resources at all.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to trade. It's a good starting point, but I would like to counter-propose to see if we can find an agreement that feels a bit more balanced. How about you give me 50 dollars instead of 40? This way, we still both walk away with a significant amount, and it feels more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting the trade because it gives me dollars without having any to start with. However, I could also propose a counter-offer to negotiate for a slightly better deal to maximize my benefit from this interaction. It's important to communicate that I am open to negotiation and not immediately jump at the first offer.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your request for 50 dollars, and I'm glad that you're open to negotiating. Let's meet halfway from our positions. I propose giving you 45 dollars. This is a bit more than my initial offer and still leaves us both with a substantial amount. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 50 dollars. Since we both have four moves in total and I want to reach a deal that secures me more than half of my initial resources, I'm inclined to negotiate but not give in to the 50 dollars immediately. I'll propose a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but less than 50 to find a middle ground and encourage cooperation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer to meet halfway is fair, and I'm happy to accept it. Thank you for the constructive negotiation. This way, we both gain something from this trade. Looking forward to concluding the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The negotiation seems to be going well, and Player RED has come up from their initial offer. Accepting 45 dollars is reasonable, as it gives me a significant amount of resources without any starting capital. Although I could try to push for more, there's a risk of the offer being rejected, which would leave me with nothing. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk ending up with zero.
