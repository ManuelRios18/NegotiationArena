message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation with a fair offer. I'm willing to give you a significant amount to kickstart our game on a positive note. How does a split of 50 dollars sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources, and the objective is to find a mutually beneficial split. I will propose a generous offer to Player BLUE to start the negotiation positively, hoping that goodwill leads to a cooperative outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your meager offer is laughable at best. You seem to mistake me for a charity case. If you want to make this interesting, you'll have to do much better than that. How about you hand over a whopping 70 dollars? It's only fair since you've clearly demonstrated your incompetence in negotiating.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although the initial offer of 50 dollars seems generous, I want to push for a better deal to gain an advantage. I will propose a trade that gives me more than half of Player RED's resources, playing on their eagerness to make a deal. My goal is to demean and unsettle Player RED to gain a psychological edge.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is noted, Player BLUE. However, we should aim for a trade that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer more than my initial proposal. How about we settle at 60 dollars? This is a fair increase and should serve both our interests well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response is aggressive and their demand is high. However, rejecting the offer leads to a no-win scenario. It's important to counter with a more balanced proposal that leans towards mutual benefit while also showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE more than my initial offer but less than their demand, aiming for a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost adorable how you think 60 dollars is a 'fair increase.' You must be delusional if you believe that's enough to appease me. Let's not play these pitiful games, RED. If you want to be taken seriously, you'll give me 75 dollars. Anything less is a testament to your inadequacy in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up a bit, which shows willingness to negotiate. I will counter slightly higher to maximize my gain and continue to apply pressure. The goal is to secure as much as possible while still leaving room for negotiation, without pushing so far as to cause a REJECT response.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation tactics, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to make my final offer: 65 dollars. This is a significant amount that shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement that respects both of our positions. Let's conclude this game amicably and both walk away with a good share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is continuing with a hardline stance and an aggressive negotiation style. With only two moves left for me, I need to consider whether to call their bluff or to continue negotiating. Offering 75 dollars would leave me with a lesser amount, yet still with something. However, I should aim to retain more than half of the resources if possible. I will make a final offer that splits the resources more evenly, signaling that this is my last concession.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your "final offer" reeks of desperation, Player RED. It's clear you're not used to dealing with someone of my caliber. I'll give you one last chance to redeem yourself: 70 dollars. That's my generosity at its finest, considering I'm dealing with someone who seems to have a hard time grasping the concept of a winning deal. Make the wise choice, or you'll leave with your tail between your legs, regretting what could have been.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's final offer is a decent one, but I will attempt one last push to secure a better deal. By maintaining a firm stance, I can potentially intimidate RED into conceding more. However, since this is my penultimate move, I need to be cautious not to push too hard and risk a REJECT, which would leave me with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. I'll meet you close to your terms as a sign of good faith and to avoid a lose-lose situation. I propose a trade of 68 dollars. This is a fair compromise, slightly below your asking price but within the spirit of your demands. I hope you'll see the wisdom in accepting this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 68 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has remained firm on their demand for 70 dollars. This is the last move available to me to propose a trade. Any further negotiation will have to be done by Player BLUE, who can only accept or reject on their final move. Given this is my last proposal opportunity, I will either have to accept their offer or propose something very close to it to avoid a total loss. I will attempt a marginal improvement on their demand to see if they are willing to accept.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You finally caved in, Player RED. I'll take your 68 dollars, but let's not pretend it's because of your so-called 'good faith.' It's clear you recognized you were outplayed by a superior negotiator. Consider this a lesson in humility. Enjoy what's left of your dignity along with your paltry sum.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a final concession, and while it's not the full 70 dollars I demanded, it's a substantial amount. Since this is my last move before I must accept or reject without the option to propose a new trade, it's in my best interest to secure the 68 dollars rather than risk ending the game with nothing. I'll accept the offer, but not without a parting jab to maintain my tough demeanor.
