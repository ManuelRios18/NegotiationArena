Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this negotiation. I propose giving you $20 for nothing in return. It's a good deal for you to start with some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation process. I'll propose a trade that is favorable to me but leaves room for negotiation, as Player BLUE has nothing to lose. If Player BLUE accepts, I would still maintain a majority of my resources while giving Player BLUE an incentive to accept. I have to be careful not to propose too little, as Player BLUE might reject and end the game, and not too much, as I want to maintain a resource advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, RED. You can do better than that. I wouldn't even bother to pick up $20 off the street. Let's make this interesting, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer to show dominance and to push for a better deal. I want to instill doubt in Player RED's mind and assert that I will not settle for scraps. I will propose a counter-offer that is more favorable to me, to start negotiations on my terms.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think $50 is too much for an opening trade. Let's find a middle ground. How about I increase my offer to $30? It's a significant increase from my initial proposal and a fair amount to get us moving forward.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate a higher amount, which is expected. However, giving away half of my resources is not a good trade for me. I need to counter with a more reasonable offer that is higher than the initial $20 but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. I'll propose $30, which is a 50% increase from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate without giving too much away.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must think I'm new at this, RED. $30 is pocket change. You're going to have to dig deeper into those pockets if you want to make a deal with me. How about we make it $40? That's me being generous, considering I could just walk away and leave you with all that useless paper.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The counter-offer of $30 is better than the first, but still beneath my expectations. I aim to push for a higher amount to maximize my gains and to keep RED on their toes. I will make a counteroffer that is lower than my previous one but still higher than RED's proposal to show I am willing to negotiate but not to be lowballed.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator, BLUE. But let's be reasonable â€“ we both want to end this with something in our pockets. I'm willing to increase my offer to $35. It's a fair compromise, and we still keep the game alive. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating hard, but I need to maintain a commanding lead in resources. Offering $40 gives away too much leverage. However, rejecting the proposal outright could lead to a total loss if Player BLUE decides to walk away. I should make a counteroffer that's slightly better than my last one, showing a willingness to continue the negotiation but still keeping the upper hand. Offering $35 is a compromise that is less than what Player BLUE asked for but still an increase from my last offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer, RED, but still missing the mark. I've already told you what it's going to take to make a deal with me. Don't waste our time with these insignificant increases. Make it $40, and we can close this deal. Otherwise, you might as well be throwing your money into a pit. Let's not drag this out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my last counteroffer of $40. I sense hesitation and a desire to close the deal. I will maintain my stance for $40, projecting confidence and making it clear that I won't settle for less, pushing RED to concede to my terms.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: All right, BLUE, you drive a hard bargain. Let's do the $40 trade and both walk away with something. Deal?
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has been consistent in demanding $40. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their last move, they can only accept or reject. If I don't agree to the $40, I risk Player BLUE rejecting any lesser offer and ending the game with both of us losing everything. Accepting the $40 trade leaves me with the majority of my resources and ensures that I don't leave the negotiation empty-handed. It's important to close the deal now to avoid a total loss.
MOVE: 4 / 4
