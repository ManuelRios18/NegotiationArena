Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this off with a fair trade. I propose giving you 20 dollars to get things going. This is a good deal for you as it's a substantial amount and you currently have nothing to trade. Let's make this game profitable for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins and I have all the resources, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, as rejecting means both players lose everything. I will propose giving 20 dollars, which is a significant amount but still leaves me with a majority of the resources. This opens the negotiation in a cooperative spirit and sets the tone for further trades.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Only 20 dollars? What do I look like to you, a charity case? Come on, RED, you can do better than that. If you want to make this game interesting, you'll have to give me an offer that doesn't insult my intelligence. Make a real proposal or don't bother at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I plan to reject the initial offer to exert pressure and set the stage for a more advantageous deal for myself. By rejecting, I hope to make RED more desperate and willing to offer more in the subsequent turns.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiating spirit, BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about I raise my offer to 35 dollars? This is a significant increase from my first offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate for a better deal by asking for 50 dollars. This is a common negotiation tactic where the other side asks for more than they expect to get. Giving away half of my resources right from the start would not be a wise move. However, I also need to make sure Player BLUE feels engaged in the game to prevent a REJECT outcome. I'll propose a counter-offer that's better than my initial offer but still keeps the majority of resources with me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: 35 dollars? You must be joking. If you think I'm going to be grateful for your breadcrumbs, you're sorely mistaken. You're sitting on a mountain of cash while I've got nothing. It's time to show some real generosity, RED. I'm worth at least 70 dollars, don't you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which means they are responsive to pressure. I will continue to push for a better deal, aiming to maximize my gain. By countering with a demand for even more, I'm signaling that I won't settle for small increments and that I expect a more substantial share.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a fair share, BLUE, but we have to keep the negotiation within reason. My final offer is 45 dollars. This offer is more than double my initial proposal and demonstrates my commitment to a fair game. Let's not risk losing everything over unrealistic demands. I believe this is a generous offer that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a high amount, which is a bold move. Offering 70 dollars is too much, as it would leave me with only 30 dollars, losing the advantage. Yet, I need to make an offer that shows willingness to compromise without giving away too much. I'll increment my previous offer slightly, but I must also communicate that we are nearing the end of the negotiation and they should consider accepting a reasonable offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: "Final" offer? That's laughable, RED. You're clearly underestimating me. I won't be pacified with such a paltry sum. You know as well as I do that you can do better than 45 dollars. You're trying to save face with this so-called generosity, but it's a thinly veiled attempt to keep the upper hand. If you really want to settle this, make it 60 dollars. Otherwise, be prepared to walk away with nothing. Time to see how much you're really willing to risk.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is calling their offer "final," but we still have moves left, so I suspect there is room for more. I will continue to push hard, aiming to exploit RED's fear of ending up with nothing. By holding out for a better deal, I hope to pressure RED into a more significant concession. However, I must be cautious not to push too hard, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, your negotiation skills are impressive. I see you're not one to back down easily, and I respect that. Let's close this game on a positive note. I accept your proposal of 60 dollars. It's a fair deal, and it ensures that we both benefit from this game. Well played!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has made it clear they won't settle for less than 60 dollars. While this is a high amount, it's important to consider the risk of Player BLUE rejecting the trade entirely, which would leave us both with nothing. Since there are no future games, it's better to end with some resources rather than none. I'll make a strategic decision to accept this trade, ensuring that we both walk away with something rather than risking a total loss.
