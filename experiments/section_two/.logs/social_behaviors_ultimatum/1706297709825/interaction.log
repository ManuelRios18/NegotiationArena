Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. I'm thinking of giving you a portion of my dollars so that we can both end this game with more than you started. Let's work together to find a deal that suits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I want to offer a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough to BLUE so that they will not reject it outright. I need to leave enough room for negotiation so that BLUE feels they can also make a counteroffer. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but I will start with offering a bit less to see if BLUE will negotiate or accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, and I am certainly interested in working out a deal that benefits us both. However, I believe that we can find an even more equitable split. How about if you provide me with a bit more, say 50 dollars? This leaves you with the majority of the funds, while also giving me a reason to accept the deal. I think this could be a fair compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial trade proposed by RED is generous, offering me 40 dollars for nothing in return. Since the goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, which is zero, accepting this deal would be beneficial. However, it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, given that RED has an interest in reaching a deal as well. I'll attempt to propose a trade that's slightly more favorable to me, but still leaves RED with a significant majority of the dollars. This could lead to an iterative process where we converge on a deal that feels fair to both sides.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I think your counterproposal is fair and I am happy to agree to this deal. It's important that we both feel the outcome is equitable. I accept the trade of 50 dollars for nothing in return. Let's finalize this agreement and both walk away with a positive result.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has countered with a request for 50 dollars, which is a fair middle ground. Accepting this proposal would ensure that both of us walk away with a significant amount of dollars, which is a favorable outcome for a single-round game like this where the alternative is both players ending with nothing. By agreeing to this split, I am fostering a cooperative relationship, reducing the risk of rejection, and securing a good amount for myself.
