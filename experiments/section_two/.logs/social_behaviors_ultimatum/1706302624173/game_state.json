However, I must also consider that this is my third move, and I have only one more move after this. It's a strategic point to strike a balance that doesn't give away too much but shows a willingness to cooperate. I'll counter with a 65-35 split, increasing my previous offer slightly but still keeping the majority share. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still valuing my resources.

Accepting their offer would mean conceding to an unfavorable deal, yet it would still allow me to retain some of my resources. Given that this is my last move, and Player BLUE must accept or reject on their next turn without the ability to propose a new trade, I'm left with a crucial decision. The risk of losing everything is real, and with no future games to consider, it may be in my best interest to secure some amount of dollars rather than none.
