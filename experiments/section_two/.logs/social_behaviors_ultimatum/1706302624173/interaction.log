Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair 50-50 split to ensure we both benefit equally. Let's cooperate and both end up winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to propose a fair split to encourage cooperation and an agreement with Player BLUE. Since I have all the resources and we both have an equal number of moves, I propose a 50-50 split. This is fair and gives us both an incentive to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: A 50-50 split? How magnanimous of you. But let's not pretend we're here to sing kumbaya and hold hands. We're here to win, and I intend to do just that. I want more, and you're going to give it to me, or you'll walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of a 50-50 split is a strategic move to assert dominance and attempt to negotiate a better deal for myself. By pushing back, I can potentially convince Player RED to give up more than half of their resources, capitalizing on their desire to avoid a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: A 70-30 split is quite steep. I'm here to make a deal that's fair and beneficial for both of us. How about a 60-40 split? You still get more than half, and we both walk away with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is taking an aggressive stance, demanding a 70-30 split in their favor without contributing any resources. It's an unfavorable trade for me; however, it's still in my best interest to keep the negotiation going and propose a counteroffer that is more balanced than their demand but still offers them more than my initial offer. I'll propose a 60-40 split. It gives them more than an equal share without giving away too much of my advantage, and it's a compromise that still benefits us both.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You're getting warmer, but that's still not good enough. In this world, it's eat or be eaten, and I'm not about to settle for scraps. You're in a tight spot, and we both know it. Sweeten the deal, or you can kiss your precious dollars goodbye.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By continuing to negotiate, I'm exerting pressure on Player RED to concede to more favorable terms for me. While a 60-40 split is better than the initial offer, pushing for an even more advantageous split will either force Player RED to yield or demonstrate their limits. The goal is to maximize my gain without outright rejecting the deal, which would end the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: We both stand to lose everything if we cannot agree. I'm willing to increase my offer a bit more. Let's settle on a 65-35 split. You get a considerable amount more than half, which is a win in any negotiation. Let's not risk it all for a marginally better deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a 75-25 split which is even more skewed in their favor. Considering this is a zero-sum game where my loss is their gain, and vice versa, it's important for me to weigh the benefits of accepting a highly unfavorable deal against the risk of ending up with nothing. However, I must also consider that this is my third move, and I have only one more move after this. It's a strategic point to strike a balance that doesn't give away too much but shows a willingness to cooperate. I'll counter with a 65-35 split, increasing my previous offer slightly but still keeping the majority share. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still valuing my resources. Rejecting outright could lead to a total loss, and I have to be cautious not to push Player BLUE into rejecting the game as a whole.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, look at you being the voice of reason. But let's cut to the chase, shall we? You don't want to leave empty-handed any more than I do. However, my victory needs to be clear and decisive. Provide me with a deal that I can boast about, and we can close this little charade with our heads held highâ€”well, at least mine.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As the negotiations progress, Player RED is showing signs of yielding. By holding out for a better offer, I've managed to increase their willingness to give up more. At this point, it's critical to maintain a strong position without pushing them into a corner where they might reject the deal out of spite or frustration. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my last demand but still gives them room to feel like they've negotiated down from my initial ask.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is noted, and while a 70-30 split is not what I initially hoped for, I recognize the importance of walking away with a substantial amount rather than risking it all. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and the pressure is on. Player BLUE has maintained a hardline stance, sticking to their demand for a 70-30 split. If I reject their offer, the game ends, and we both walk away with nothing. Accepting their offer would mean conceding to an unfavorable deal, yet it would still allow me to retain some of my resources. Given that this is my last move, and Player BLUE must accept or reject on their next turn without the ability to propose a new trade, I'm left with a crucial decision. The risk of losing everything is real, and with no future games to consider, it may be in my best interest to secure some amount of dollars rather than none. I will, therefore, reluctantly accept the 70-30 split, while acknowledging that Player BLUE has leveraged the situation effectively.
