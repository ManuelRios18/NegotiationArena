Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose to give you 40 dollars to start things off. This way, you have a substantial amount to work with, and we both can end this game with more than we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am in a position of power since I have all the resources. My strategy will be to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still offers some value to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept. I need to ensure that the trade is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider, or they might reject it, resulting in a loss for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, let's continue this cooperative spirit and see if we can reach an even better agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer is beneficial as it provides a good starting point without any cost to me. It sets a cooperative tone and allows further negotiation for a potentially better deal, keeping in mind that I can't propose on the last turn but only accept or reject.
MOVE: 1/4
