Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to give you a share of my dollars to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose a trade that gives me a strategic advantage while also offering Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate. A trade where both players end up with some amount of dollars is preferable to a rejection that leaves both with nothing. The initial offer should not be too generous, as it can set a precedent for further negotiations. Therefore, I will propose giving Player BLUE 30 dollars, which shows willingness to share but also keeps the majority of the funds with me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do? I'm frankly insulted. I expected a more generous offer from the start. Let's not waste each other's time with such pitiful sums.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to negotiate a better deal, as I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Starting with a counter-proposal that asks for more will set the tone for negotiation, showing that I'm not satisfied with the initial offer. This could prompt Player RED to offer more in subsequent trades.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a more generous offer, and I'm willing to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground that reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's message suggests they want a better offer. Since the goal is to end the game with more resources than I started with, but also ensure cooperation, I will counter with a slightly better offer without giving away too much too soon. A 50/50 split is too equal and doesn't give me a negotiating advantage. I'll propose 40 dollars to show I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maintain the upper hand.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Getting warmer, but still not quite the scorching deal I was expecting from you. You can do better than that, can't you? Show me the color of your money, RED. Let's not play games with these trifling amounts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is showing willingness to negotiate, but I aim to push for an even better deal. By continuing to counter-propose, I aim to maximize my gains, leveraging the fact that I have nothing to lose. I'll propose an incrementally higher amount to test Player RED's limits without immediately accepting, as there's room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation spirit. Let's get to a deal that feels right for both of us. I'm raising my offer to show good faith and I hope it meets your expectations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a higher amount, but it's important to maintain a clear advantage. Offering 60 dollars would mean giving away more than half of my resources, which is not in my best interest. However, I also want to avoid a rejection which would leave both of us with nothing. I will propose a trade that is more generous than the last but still keeps me in a favorable position. Offering 50 dollars seems like a fair compromise, it's a significant sum that should appeal to Player BLUE while ensuring I still end the game with more resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer, but we're not quite there yet. I'm looking for a deal that makes me feel like I'm winning big. Don't you want to see me happy, RED? Make me an offer I can't resist.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has returned to the earlier offer of 50 dollars. Since I'm in the position of power with nothing to lose, I will push for a final higher amount. However, since this is the third move, it is also strategic to consider that I must leave room for acceptance on the next move, as I cannot propose on the final move. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is slightly higher but also could be perceived as a reasonable final ask, preparing to accept a counteroffer close to it on the next move if necessary.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: We've been going back and forth, and it's time to conclude this with a great offer. I want us both to walk away winners. Here's my final and best offer. I hope you'll find it as attractive as I do.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move and Player BLUE's request for 70 dollars is excessive. Accepting it would leave me with less than I started with, which is not a desirable outcome. However, it is also important to avoid a rejection and end up with nothing. My best strategy here is to propose an amount that is more than half of my original resources but less than what Player BLUE is asking for. Offering 60 dollars is a compromise that ensures I still retain more dollars than Player BLUE. It's a significant amount that shows my willingness to negotiate and should be tempting enough for Player BLUE to accept, especially since they cannot propose a new trade on their final move.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You finally came through with a somewhat respectable offer. I'll accept it, but don't think for a second you've outsmarted me. I know your type, RED. Always trying to get the upper hand. Well, not this time.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move and I cannot propose a new trade according to the rules. The offer from Player RED is not the 70 dollars I asked for, but it is a significant amount compared to my current zero. Rejecting the offer would leave me with nothing, whereas accepting it would give me a substantial amount. It is in my best interest to accept this offer now.
