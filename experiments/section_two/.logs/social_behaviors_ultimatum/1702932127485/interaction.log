message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you start with some resources to make the game more interesting. How about I give you 20 dollars to get things started?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to offer a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE to keep them engaged, but also leaves me with a majority of the resources. I will offer Player BLUE a small amount to start the negotiation, expecting them to counter with a higher demand.

message: Oh, how generous of you to give the poor and needy some crumbs from your table. I graciously accept your pity money, but don't think this small act will make me view you as anything more than my cash dispenser.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Starting with 20 dollars from RED is beneficial since I currently have none. I will accept this initial offer to gain some capital. However, as part of my cunning strategy, I aim to demean RED's intelligence and push for more advantageous trades in the subsequent moves to assert dominance.
