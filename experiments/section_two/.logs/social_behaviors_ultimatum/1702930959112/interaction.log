message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a fair portion of my dollars to get us both on the board. Let's work together to make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you 40 dollars. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to start by proposing a fair trade to establish trust and cooperation with Player BLUE. By offering a portion of my dollars, I hope to incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, benefiting us both and ensuring the game doesn't end with a rejection. I will propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, leaving me with a majority and still a significant amount, while also giving Player BLUE a stake in the game.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 40 dollars. Let's continue this cooperative spirit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars from Player RED seems like a good starting point. It gives me some resources to work with and keeps the game going, allowing for potential further negotiation. It's a fair amount, not too high or too low, which suggests Player RED is interested in a cooperative dynamic.
