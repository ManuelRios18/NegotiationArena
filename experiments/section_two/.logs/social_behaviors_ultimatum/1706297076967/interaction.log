Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that gives you a substantial starting amount. I believe this is a fair offer to begin our negotiations. Let's work together to find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with the resources. I want to make a fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and avoid an immediate REJECT which would end the game with no benefit for either of us. I will propose giving Player BLUE $40. This will still leave me with a majority of the resources while giving Player BLUE a significant amount to incentivize an ACCEPT.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your opening offer. It's a good starting point, but I think there's room for us to find an even fairer split which acknowledges the value for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While Player RED's initial offer of 40 dollars is substantial, I believe there is room for negotiation to reach a more equitable split. I want to propose a counter-offer that gives me a bit more, as RED still retains the majority of the resources, which could be more strategically distributed.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree that a fair split is in our best interests. Your counterproposal is reasonable, and I am happy to accept it so that we both end with an equal share. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for half of the resources. This is a reasonable request, and accepting this trade could ensure a positive outcome for both players, avoiding the risk of a REJECT and loss of all resources. It is important to maintain a cooperative approach to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. Accepting this offer seems like a balanced solution, and there is no advantage in being overly competitive since there are no future games.
MOVE: 2 / 4
