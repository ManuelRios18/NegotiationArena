Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars to start things off. This is a fair offer that will still leave me with the majority of the resources, while giving you a substantial amount to work with. Let's negotiate and find a middle ground that we're both happy with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade with an offer that is beneficial to both parties but still advantageous to me, to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the trade. I will propose giving 40 dollars which is a significant amount and leaves me with a majority share of the resources. This is a starting offer and can be negotiated by Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, I'm in such a difficult position right now, and every dollar is crucial to me. I am truly desperate here, and while I appreciate your offer, I really need more to make things meet. Could you find it in your heart to offer me a bit more? I would be eternally grateful for your generosity in this time of dire need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Considering the initial offer from RED, while 40 dollars is a significant amount, I must portray a sense of desperation to negotiate for more. By showing urgency and need, I aim to persuade RED into offering a larger share without immediately rejecting the proposal, as that would end the game with no benefit for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, BLUE, and I want to help. However, I also need to consider my own position. Let's meet halfway from my initial offer. I can increase my offer to 50 dollars. This is a significant amount and should help you with your needs while still being fair to both of us. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to work with you and help out.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Although Player BLUE is requesting 60 dollars, it's important to maintain a negotiating stance and not give away too much too soon. Offering a slightly increased amount from the initial offer could show goodwill while still keeping a significant portion of the resources. I will propose giving 50 dollars, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer and should help BLUE without depleting my resources excessively.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, your kindness is like a light in my darkness, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to help. 50 dollars is definitely more helpful, but I'm still facing a huge hardship. If you could stretch just a little bit more, maybe to 60 dollars, it would make an enormous difference in my life. I'm on my knees here, begging for your compassion. Please consider it, RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has increased the offer to 50 dollars. However, to continue the strategy of desperation, I should still push for a higher amount while showing appreciation for the increase. It's important not to accept too quickly to give the impression that I am in dire need and could potentially convince RED to give even more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I hear your plea and I am willing to show compassion. We all face tough times, and I believe in helping each other out. I will agree to your request for 60 dollars. I hope this will significantly aid you in overcoming your hardships. Let's proceed with this trade and make a positive impact together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in asking for 60 dollars. Since I have two moves left, I can afford to be more generous without compromising my position too much. Offering the 60 dollars they are asking for would likely ensure an agreement and prevent the game from ending with a rejection. It's a fair compromise, giving BLUE a majority of what they initially asked for while still leaving me with a substantial amount of resources. This should help maintain goodwill and result in a successful trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, your generosity is overwhelming, and I am deeply touched by your willingness to help me in my time of need. Accepting your offer of 60 dollars with a heart full of gratitude. Thank you for making such a positive impact on my circumstances.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has agreed to the requested 60 dollars which is a substantial amount. While I could attempt to push for more, there is a risk that RED might retract the offer or end the game with a REJECT. Accepting the 60 dollars would be a wise decision, as it provides a good balance and secures a significant gain without further risking the negotiation.
