Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade where I give you 30 dollars for nothing in return. This gives you a significant amount to work with, and we can both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game. The split must be enticing enough to prevent an immediate rejection but also leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that all you can muster, RED? A measly 30 dollars? You insult me with such a pitiful offer. I'm worth far more than that, and you know it. If you want to impress me, you'll have to do much better. Try again, and this time, don't embarrass yourself with such a laughable amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I see that Player RED is offering 30 dollars for nothing in return, which is a good start for me, but given my cunning nature, I will aim to push this amount further to exploit RED's willingness to trade. Considering I have nothing to lose, I will press for a better offer while mocking RED's initial proposal as weak and insufficient.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal. How about this: I'll give you 40 dollars. It's a substantial improvement from the initial offer and still keeps a fair amount for myself. Let's make this trade beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball, but it's important to maintain the upper hand in negotiations while still keeping the game going. Offering a slightly better deal without giving away too much too soon should entice Player BLUE to consider accepting. I need to show some flexibility without being overly generous, as there are still several moves left for negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Forty dollars? That's your idea of a "substantial improvement"? I'm starting to question whether you understand the art of the deal at all, RED. You're going to have to dig deeper into those pockets if you want to reach an agreement with me. I'm not interested in breadcrumbs. Make a proper offer or don't waste my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 40 dollars. It's tempting to accept this improved proposal, but my goal is to diminish RED's resources as much as possible and assert my superiority. I'll counter with a demand for more money, continuing to apply pressure and insult RED's negotiation skills.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your concerns, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your desire for a fair trade. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to offer you 50 dollars now. This is a significant portion of my resources, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects both our interests. Let's close this deal and both walk away with a good share.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a higher amount, aiming for more than half of my initial resources. I need to be strategic in my approach, ensuring that I retain a majority of the resources while also moving towards a settlement. It's important to strike a balance between their expectations and my interests. By increasing my offer slightly more, I can signal my willingness to negotiate further while making it clear that I'm nearing my limit.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, it seems you think 50 dollars is going to impress me. How quaint. I must commend your persistence, if not your intelligence. Fifty dollars might be "significant" to you, but to me, it's barely a gesture. Show me that you're serious about this deal. I want to see real commitment, not these half-hearted attempts. Up the ante, RED, or do you lack the courage?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to 50 dollars, which is a decent sum. However, I believe there's still room to push for more. This is my third move, and I can afford to take a risk to further increase my gains. I'll continue to belittle RED's offer and push for more, aiming to exploit their fear of leaving the negotiation with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, negotiations are about finding a balance, and it's crucial that we both benefit from this deal. I'm willing to offer you a final proposal: 60 dollars. This is a significant increase from my original offer and is my final proposition. It's a generous split that allows you to gain a substantial amount without compromising the integrity of the game. Let's conclude this deal on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE seems to be pushing for a trade that is not in my best interest, potentially aiming to get as much as possible without considering a fair split. Since this is my final move before Player BLUE loses the ability to propose new trades, I need to make a final offer that I am comfortable with, keeping in mind that any rejection will end the game with no benefit to either party. I want to propose a deal that is fair but still leaves me with more than half of my resources.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, albeit barely. Your final offer is just acceptable enough for me to consider it worthy of my time. I'll graciously accept your 60 dollars, though it's clear who the superior negotiator is here. Let's conclude this charade of a negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has moved up to 60 dollars. This is my final move, and I must accept or reject the offer. Rejecting would leave both RED and me with nothing, which is not in my interest. Accepting the 60 dollars would give me a substantial amount of RED's resources, which aligns with my aim to come out ahead. Therefore, I should accept this final offer, but not without a parting jab to maintain my sly image.
