Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to offer you a trade to get you started in the game. Let's work together to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game while still keeping the majority of resources for myself. Since Player BLUE starts with no resources, they are incentivized to accept some positive amount. I will start by offering a smaller amount to see if Player BLUE will accept, leaving room for negotiation in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how charitable of you! Offering a mere 10 dollars from your overflowing coffers. Do you think I'm some kind of peasant to be satisfied with scraps? Let's see if you can actually make a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Starting with no resources puts me at a disadvantage, and the initial offer of 10 dollars is a paltry sum considering Player RED's total resources. I aim to leverage this to negotiate a better deal, demonstrating that I am not so easily placated by a minimal offer. By proposing a higher amount, I can signal that I expect a more significant share, which may lead to a more favorable negotiation for me. Insulting Player RED could potentially provoke a more generous offer if they become eager to assert their superiority or could lead to an immediate rejection, which would end the game with no gain for either side. I'll proceed with caution but aim to push for a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can see you're driving a hard bargain, but let's keep in mind that if we can't agree, we both lose everything. I'm willing to offer a bit more than my initial proposal. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer and countered with a demand for more. Given the rules of the game, if I reject their counter-offer, we both end up with nothing, which is a worse outcome for both of us. I will counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but less than what Player BLUE is asking for. This shows willingness to negotiate and may lead to Player BLUE lowering their expectations.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Only 20 dollars? That's a laugh! You must be joking if you think doubling a pathetic offer suddenly makes it good. It's still just a drop in the ocean compared to what you have. You're going to have to do a lot better than that if you don't want to look like a complete miser.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opponent has increased their offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the offer is still not at the level that I demanded, which means there is room to push for more. By standing firm and demanding more, I can potentially maximize my gain. Insulting the opponent may provoke a more significant response, either in the form of a better offer or a rejection. As this is a game with no real consequences, the risk of a rejection resulting in a loss of all resources is acceptable in the pursuit of gaining a larger share.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm to negotiate for a fair amount. Let's find a middle ground that we can both be happy with. I'm increasing my offer significantly, and I hope this shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has strongly indicated that they are not interested in low offers and seems to be sticking to a higher demand. While giving away half of my resources is not ideal, it's better than losing everything. However, I should still attempt to retain more than what they're asking for. Therefore, I will increase my offer to a point that is between my last offer and their counter-offer. This should signal a significant concession on my part while still keeping the upper hand in the negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: A significant increase? You must be jesting. Forty dollars is a far cry from being a fair share. You're holding onto your wealth tighter than a barnacle to a ship's hull. What's the matter? Afraid to part with a little more of your hoarded treasure? You're still not showing enough commitment for my liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opponent is steadily increasing their offer, which suggests they are motivated to make a deal. However, they have not yet met my previous demand of 50 dollars. This is my second to last move, and I should push for a higher amount while I still have leverage, knowing that on my final move, I will not be able to propose a new trade and can only accept or reject. I will continue to apply pressure to see if Player RED is willing to concede more in order to avoid a total loss.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: We've both held our ground, but it's time to come to a decision. I'm making a final offer that I believe is fair for both of us, considering the risk of losing everything. I hope you'll see this as a sign of good faith and cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has been very assertive with their demands. Offering 60 dollars would leave me with only a slight majority of the resources. As this is the last move I can make a proposal on, and since Player BLUE cannot counter on their next move, I will have to make a decision that is most likely to be accepted to avoid ending with nothing. I will split the difference between my last offer and their demand to show I am making a fair final offer.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, you've come to your senses and offered something that isn't completely insulting. I accept your offer, and I appreciate you finally recognizing my value in this game. Let's conclude this charade of generosity and call it a day.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move, and Player RED has met my previous demand of 50 dollars. Since I can no longer propose a new trade and must choose between accepting and rejecting, it is in my best interest to accept this offer. Rejecting at this point would result in no gain for either player. Accepting this offer will ensure that I walk away with a substantial amount of Player RED's resources, achieving a win from my initial position of disadvantage.
