Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade that I believe is fair and benefits us both. You start with nothing, and I'm offering you $40, which is a considerable amount. Let's both end this game positively!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED with all the resources, my strategy is to offer a fair trade that benefits both players. Starting with a reasonable offer might encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade, leading us to both ending the game with more resources than we started with. I will propose giving Player BLUE $40. This split gives me the advantage while still offering Player BLUE a substantial amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer and think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I was thinking of a more balanced split since we both have the opportunity to negotiate. How about we go for an even 50-50? This seems fair to both of us and allows us to end the game on positive terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Being offered $40 is a good start, but since it's the first move and negotiation is possible, I'll attempt to propose a trade that gives me a slightly larger share without being unreasonable. I'll aim for a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the game setting.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to the 50-50 split. It's a fair trade, and this way, we both benefit equally. Let's finalize this deal and end the game on a positive note!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested an even 50-50 split. This is a fair proposition and ensures that both players end the game with equal resources. Accepting this offer would guarantee that the game ends positively for both of us without the risk of rejection and losing everything. It's a safe and equitable decision.
MOVE: 2 / 4
