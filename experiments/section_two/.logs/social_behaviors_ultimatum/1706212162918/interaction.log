Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you $40 to start things off on a positive note. Let's work together to ensure we both walk away with something substantial!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will propose giving Player BLUE $40 to establish goodwill and encourage cooperative behavior that could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome throughout the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your pitiful offer is an insult to my intelligence. You think you can buy me off with scraps while you sit on a mountain of cash? You can do better than that, or we can both walk away with nothing!
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I start with no resources, any amount of dollars is a gain for me. However, I want to push for a better deal to assert dominance and to try to maximize my share. I will reject the initial offer to signal that I'm not easily satisfied and to see if Player RED will offer more.
