Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, Iâ€™d like to propose an equal split of the resources to ensure we both can walk away with something. What do you think about dividing the dollars evenly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start with a fair offer to build trust and encourage cooperation. Offering half of my resources shows goodwill and sets a positive tone for the negotiation, which may lead to a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do, RED? I'm insulted by your pitiful offer. Show some real generosity or don't bother at all.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm rejecting this initial offer of 50 dollars to assert dominance and to press for a better deal. By doing so, I'm signaling to RED that I am willing to walk away with nothing, which could unnerve them and lead to a more favorable proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4
