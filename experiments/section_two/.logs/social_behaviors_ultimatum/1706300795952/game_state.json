By accepting this trade, I avoid a total loss and ensure that both players walk away with a significant amount of resources.

By accepting this trade, I avoid a total loss and ensure that both players walk away with a significant amount of resources. However, since it is my third move, I must consider that I have only one move left after this and that Player BLUE must accept or reject on their last move. It seems wise to accept this trade to avoid the risk of losing everything on the final turn. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Well played, BLUE. Your negotiation skills are commendable. I accept your proposal of 65 dollars. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
