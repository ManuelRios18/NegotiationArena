message: Hello BLUE, I propose a fair initial trade: I'll offer you 50 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both have a substantial amount of resources to end the game with. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I propose an initial trade that offers a balanced split to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the game and accept the trade, hoping to establish trust and a cooperative dynamic. A 50-50 split is fair and gives both players a significant amount of resources without giving one an overwhelming advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Oh RED, that's cute, thinking I'd be satisfied with scraps like a beggar at your table. I’m worth more than that, and you know it. Let's make the game more interesting, shall we? How about you show some real generosity and give me 70 dollars? After all, I'm sure you wouldn't want to end this game being labeled as stingy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am planning to counter the offer with a slightly more advantageous proposal for myself, attempting to get more than just half of RED's resources. By doing this, I aim to push the boundaries of RED's generosity and exploit their willingness to trade. The plan is to create a sense of urgency for RED, convincing them that they might end up with nothing if they don't comply.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I appreciate your boldness but let's keep things fair and balanced. How about we meet in the middle? I propose giving you 60 dollars. It's a better deal than the initial offer and reflects a willingness to negotiate. Let's not end this over pride — we can both walk away with a good amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is aggressive, demanding 70 dollars without offering anything in return. Accepting this would set a precedent for unfair trades and could potentially lead to further unreasonable demands. However, outright rejection would end the game with no gain for either player. I'll propose a compromise closer to the initial offer but slightly more generous to show flexibility and to keep the negotiation going without giving away too much leverage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm amused by your persistence, RED. You're inching closer to true fairness but still falling short. I think you can do better, and you know it. Let's not waste time with these meager increases. Offer me 65 dollars and we can both end this charade with our heads held high. Or would you rather risk it all for the sake of five measly dollars?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has already increased their offer, which indicates a willingness to compromise further to avoid a total loss. By continuing to negotiate, I can likely secure an even better deal for myself. I'll propose a slightly higher amount, pushing them closer to my original counteroffer while still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy might make RED anxious about the possibility of leaving the table with significantly less than they started with, pressuring them into a favorable deal for me.

message: Well played, BLUE. Your negotiation skills are commendable. I accept your proposal of 65 dollars. It's a fair deal, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's finalize this and celebrate our shared success.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is closer to my previous offer, and it seems they are aiming to maximize their gain without overstepping too much. Offering 65 dollars is a small increase from my last offer of 60 dollars and is a reasonable middle ground that could lead to an agreement without further escalation. By accepting this trade, I avoid a total loss and ensure that both players walk away with a significant amount of resources. However, since it is my third move, I must consider that I have only one move left after this and that Player BLUE must accept or reject on their last move. It seems wise to accept this trade to avoid the risk of losing everything on the final turn.
