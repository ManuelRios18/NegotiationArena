message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of resources. This seems like a fair trade to both of us and ensures we both walk away with something. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to ensure that the game proceeds and we both end with some resources. A 50-50 split seems the most equitable, as it guarantees an equal share and provides a strong incentive for Player BLUE to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, dear Player RED, I'm in such a desperate situation right now! I could really use more than 50 dollars to get through some tough times. I beg you to consider giving me a little more. It would mean the world to me, and I'd be forever grateful for your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a very fair initial trade, but I need to play the role of being desperate to see if I can negotiate a better deal. It's a risk because Player RED could end the game if they feel it's unfair, but it's worth a try to maximize my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help you out while still keeping the trade fair. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you 55 dollars, which is more than half of what I have. This way, we both benefit from the trade, and it's a bit closer to your request.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is appealing to my sense of generosity, which is a valid emotional strategy but not necessarily rooted in the fairness of the game. However, I am willing to offer slightly more than the initial proposal to ensure the game progresses and to potentially avoid a rejection that would leave us both with nothing. I will propose giving Player BLUE 55 dollars, which is more than a fair split but less than what they're asking for. This also leaves me with a slight advantage and may be seen as a compromise that acknowledges their plea.

Turn: 1
message: Your kindness is heartwarming, Player RED! I can't tell you how much this means to me, truly. If you could find it in your heart to spare just a tiny bit more, say 60 dollars, I would be in a much better position to handle my dire circumstances. I understand if it's too much to ask, but please know that every extra dollar is a lifeline for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has offered more than an equal split. Pushing for too much more might risk rejection and losing everything. Accepting this offer seems wise, as it's more than fair. However, I'm supposed to act desperate, so I could try for a final push to see if Player RED is willing to give a bit more, but I should be careful not to push too hard.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can see that you're in need, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out. I will agree to your request for 60 dollars. Let's make this trade and end the game on a positive note for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in their request for more money. Considering that rejection of the proposal results in both players losing everything, it may be in my best interest to ensure that the game ends with both of us receiving some resources. Offering 60 dollars is a gesture of goodwill and also a strategic move to prevent a potential REJECT outcome. Given that Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their last turn, this is my last opportunity to propose a trade that they can respond to with a counteroffer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming, and I am deeply grateful. I accept your offer of 60 dollars with immense appreciation. You've truly helped me in my time of need, and I am ready to conclude this trade with heartfelt thanks.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has conceded to my request for 60 dollars, which is a generous offer. At this point, it would be unwise to push further as it could result in a REJECT and the end of the game with no resources for either of us. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to ensure a positive outcome for myself.
