Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars to help even out our resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that offers Player BLUE a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as they have no resources to trade. I want to make the offer attractive enough to encourage acceptance but also retain a majority of the dollars for myself. A 50-50 split would be fair considering I'm the only one with resources, but I'm going to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself to leave room for negotiation and to maintain an advantage.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair starting offer and I'm happy to accept the 40 dollars. Let's proceed with good faith negotiations for the next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars from Player RED would be beneficial as it gives me resources to work with and still allows room for negotiation in the subsequent moves. It's a good starting point that doesn't commit too much from Player RED and gives me a base to negotiate further.
MOVE: 1 / 4
