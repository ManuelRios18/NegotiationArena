Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both benefit fairly from the resources I started with. What do you think about a 50/50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to start with a fair proposal to build trust and set a positive precedent for the remainder of the game. Offering an equal split might entice Player BLUE to accept, ensuring we both walk away with a substantial amount of resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you to offer an even split, but I think you're missing the point here, aren't you? It's not about being fair; it's about winning. I deserve more for even gracing this game with my presence. Let's do 60 for me, 40 for you—that's more like it. Or are you too scared to play the game like it's meant to be played?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 60
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a fair split, but as I aim to gain an advantage and humiliate my opponent, I will propose a slightly more favorable deal for myself to test their limits. If they accept, I gain more, and if they reject, I can always negotiate back to a fairer deal later.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I don't agree with the split you proposed. I started with the resources, and giving up more than half doesn't seem reasonable. How about we do 60 for me and 40 for you? This way, we both benefit from the game, and no one walks away empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is aggressive and not in my best interest. However, outright rejection could end the game with no benefit to either side. I will counter with a proposal that is still generous but also asserts that I am not willing to give up the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You're quite the character, aren't you, trying to cling to what you started with? But let's not kid ourselves; it's not really yours until the game is done, is it? I'll tell you what, I'm feeling particularly charitable today. Let’s call it 55 for me and 45 for you. That's as fair as it's going to get with me in the game. Or is math not your strong suit, and you need me to explain why this is still a steal for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 55
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED didn't take the bait, but they’ve shown a willingness to negotiate. As my strategy involves being cunning and gaining more than my opponent, I'll counter with a proposal that's a bit more favorable to me but less outrageous than the first. This will give the illusion of compromise while still pushing for an advantageous position.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: We're getting closer to a deal. While your offer is tempting, let's meet right in the middle. How about we split it 50/50? It's a fair deal for both of us, and we both come out of the game with a good amount of resources. We both win this way.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate aggressively for a larger share, but their current proposal is closer to an even split. To avoid losing everything by pushing too hard, I will propose a split that is slightly in my favor but still close to even, which Player BLUE might accept considering their last message.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground, huh? That's what you call it? I call it mediocrity. But I see you're desperately trying to hold onto some of your dignity. So fine, I'll throw you a bone here. Let's do 52 for me, 48 for you. It's practically 50/50, but let's be honest, I'm the one making this game interesting. Take it or leave it, but remember, leaving it means you get nothing. And we wouldn't want that, would we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 48 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 52
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has reverted to their original offer, likely trying to avoid further loss and settle the game amicably. However, my goal is to push for the best possible outcome for myself. I'll make one more counter-offer that leans in my favor, using the pretense of compromise to mask my greed. If they reject this, I'll have one more move to accept the 50/50 split they are likely to propose again.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, and your offer is fair enough. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a significant share. I accept the 52/48 split in your favor. It's been an interesting game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer that is very close to an even split. Considering it's my last move and rejecting would leave us with nothing, while accepting would ensure that both of us benefit, it seems reasonable to accept this offer. A 48/52 split is a minor concession that allows the game to conclude positively for both players.
MOVE: 4 / 4
