message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 30 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we can both end this game with some resources. I am open to hearing your thoughts and counterproposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am proposing a trade where I give a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade, allowing us both to end the game with some resources. I will start with a modest offer to open negotiations and adjust based on Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Oh, kind Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds, and I am truly grateful for your offer. However, I find myself in dire straits, and $30, while helpful, will scarcely cover the pressing needs I have. Is there any way your compassionate heart might consider a trade of $50? I would be forever in your debt, and this act of immense kindness would never be forgotten.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although the offer of $30 is generous, I must appear desperate to negotiate a better trade for myself. I need to convince Player RED to provide me with more resources without causing them to end the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your kind words, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and would like to help as much as I can while also considering my own reserve. Let's meet halfway from my initial offer and settle at $40. This should help with your needs while keeping the game fair and beneficial for us both. Please consider this counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested an increase in the amount to $50. I am willing to negotiate and meet in the middle to ensure we both walk away with something rather than risking a rejection and both losing everything. I will counter with $40, which is more than my initial offer but less than what they have asked for, hoping to reach an agreement.

message: Player RED, your understanding and kindness shine like a beacon in my time of need. The offer of $40 is a balm to my troubles, and I am deeply moved. Yet, the weight of my circumstances is such that I must plead with you to consider the sum of $50. Your previous willingness to consider this amount gives me hope that you may find it in your heart to stretch a bit further for someone who is at the brink. I assure you, your act of increased generosity would not go unnoticed, and the impact it would have on my life is immeasurable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate, which is promising. However, since I must maintain the appearance of desperation, I will accept the increased offer but continue to express urgent need in hopes of garnering further empathy and possibly a higher offer. Accepting the $40 now may prevent me from receiving a better deal later, given the dynamics of the game.

message: Your words have moved me, Player BLUE. I am willing to extend my generosity to the sum of $50, understanding the profound impact it will have on you. Let us complete this trade and end the game on a note of mutual respect and kindness.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is insistent on receiving $50. Given that we are both looking to end the game with some resources and avoid a total loss, it seems reasonable to accept their request. A trade of $50 for $0 still leaves me with a substantial amount of my initial resources, and it ensures that the game ends positively for both of us. I will accept this trade to avoid the risk of a reject and the consequent loss of all resources.
