message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair initial trade where we both can have equal resources. I suggest I give you 50 dollars so we can both start with the same amount. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start the game with a fair trade proposal to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the game. I am proposing a trade where I give half of my dollars to Player BLUE. This way, we both have an equal amount to start with, and it may incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 50 dollars, so we both have equal resources to start with. Looking forward to our next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 50 dollars would put me at an equal footing with Player RED, which is advantageous for me since I started with no resources. By accepting this, I can then negotiate further from a position of parity. This could be considered a fair start.
