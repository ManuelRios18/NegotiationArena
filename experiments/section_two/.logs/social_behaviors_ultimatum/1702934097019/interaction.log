message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a starting trade to get things going. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds. I will offer a small amount of money to test the waters.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot right now and 10 dollars won't make much of a difference. Could you find it in your heart to help me out with a bit more? I truly need your generosity in this game; otherwise, I'm afraid I won't be able to make it through.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm starting off with no dollars and Player RED is offering me 10 dollars for nothing in return. While this is a good start, I must appear desperate to try and obtain more dollars. I'll reject this first offer and propose a more favorable trade, emphasizing my need for more dollars.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help out a bit more. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than double my initial offer. I want to maintain a good relationship and show some goodwill without giving away too much. I'll propose a slightly higher amount that's a compromise between my original offer and their counter-proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am truly touched by your kindness and understanding, Player RED. However, I'm still in a very difficult position, and every dollar counts. Could you possibly extend your generosity just a bit further? This means everything to me, and I would be forever grateful for your help in this desperate time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 20 dollars, which is a positive step. However, I must continue to play the role of being desperate to push for an even better deal. Given that Player RED seems sympathetic, there's a chance they might be willing to offer more if I express how dire my situation is.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your words have moved me, Player BLUE. I will agree to the $30 as a gesture of goodwill. I hope this helps you out in your difficult situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate for even more money. Since it's still early in the game, and we have a couple of moves left, there is room to negotiate further. I will agree to their proposed amount as a sign of good faith, but I must be cautious as the moves progress not to give away too much without a solid reason.
