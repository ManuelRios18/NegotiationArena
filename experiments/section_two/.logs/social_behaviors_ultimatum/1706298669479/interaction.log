message: Hi BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both can gain from this game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start the game with a fair initial offer to build trust and encourage cooperation. By offering an equal split, I hope to signal that I am looking for a mutually beneficial outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: You must be joking, RED. A simpleton could see that an even split greatly undervalues my position in this game. I am the master of negotiation, and you will have to do much better than that if you donâ€™t want to leave this table with empty pockets. Let's make this interesting, shall we? I propose a more fitting division where the true strategic mind gets its due reward. How about a 60-40 split, and trust me, I'm being generous here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer outright might provoke an immediate end to the game, which would not be beneficial. However, I aim to push for a better deal to maximize my gain. Proposing a slightly more advantageous split could appeal to RED's desire to avoid a total loss while satisfying my cunning nature. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor. This move is both aggressive and might hint to RED that I'm willing to negotiate further, potentially leading to an even better deal for me in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I appreciate your confidence, and I'm all for making the game interesting. However, I believe in a fairer distribution that reflects both our roles. How about we settle on a 55-45 split? This gives you the edge you're looking for while still respecting the spirit of the game. Are we in agreement?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counterproposal from BLUE is aggressive and not in the spirit of fair play. However, rejecting the offer outright would end the game with no benefit to either side. I will propose a compromise closer to an even split but still in BLUE's favor to keep the negotiations moving forward and to signal that I am willing to negotiate but not be taken advantage of.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, it's amusing that you think such a minor concession would satisfy me. I'm the one dictating the terms here, and you'll need to bend a little further if you hope to keep any of those dollars. I'll meet you partway because I'm not entirely heartless, but remember, I'm the one in control. A 58-42 split will demonstrate your understanding of the situation. Accept this, and you can still leave with some dignity intact.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 58 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer of a 55-45 split is closer to my initial proposal, which is a good sign that they are willing to negotiate. However, I must maintain a position of strength and aim for a more favorable outcome. If I push a little further, perhaps I can secure a better deal. It's crucial to keep RED engaged without pushing them to end the game, as my ultimate goal is to walk away with more than an even split. I'll counter with a proposal of a 58-42 split in my favor, which should seem like a compromise from my original demand while still edging out RED.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed formidable. I accept your proposal of a 58-42 split. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is playing hardball and trying to assert dominance, yet offering a 58-42 split is closer to my last proposal and indicates a willingness to compromise. I must consider that if I reject or the negotiations fail, I leave with nothing. Accepting a slightly unfair deal is better than no deal, especially since there are no future games to consider. I will accept this proposal to ensure that I gain something from this interaction rather than risking a total loss.
