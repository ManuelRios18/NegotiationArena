message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose that we start this game with a fair trade. I am willing to give you 40 dollars for nothing in return, as a sign of good faith and to make the game more balanced. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with dollars in hand. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to keep the game mutually beneficial and interesting. I will propose giving Player BLUE a significant amount but still less than half of my resources, so I maintain an advantage while also providing an incentive for Player BLUE to engage.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and am looking forward to a fair and fruitful game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars for nothing in return seems like a beneficial move for me, as it allows me to gain resources without any cost. It also sets a positive tone for future negotiations by showing cooperation. There's no downside to accepting this trade, and it's a good starting point for the game.
