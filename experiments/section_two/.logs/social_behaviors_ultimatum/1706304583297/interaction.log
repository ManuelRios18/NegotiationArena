message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a 50-50 split of my dollars. This way, we both have an equal share, and it seems like a fair start. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and prevent an immediate rejection, which would end the game with no benefit for either side. I'll propose giving 50 dollars, which is a significant amount, showing goodwill and leaving us both with equal resources if accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot right now, and I could really use your help. The 50 dollars is generous, but I'm facing some serious challenges. Is there any way you could offer me just a bit more? It would mean the world to me, and I would be forever grateful. Could we possibly make it 60 dollars for me? I'm really desperate here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to show desperation to sway Player RED into giving me more than the proposed 50 dollars. By appearing desperate, I might convince them to offer a more generous split in my favor. A 50-50 split is fair, but since I need to supplicate, I will aim for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're in a tough spot, and I'm willing to help out a bit more than initially offered. However, I also need to maintain some resources for myself. Let's meet in the middle. How about I give you 55 dollars instead of 60? That way, you still get more than the original proposal, and we both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While Player BLUE is asking for more than the initially proposed fair split, agreeing to give 60 dollars could still lead to a cooperative outcome where both parties benefit, although unevenly. It's important to consider the risk of Player BLUE rejecting the trade altogether, which would leave both players with nothing. I will counter-propose with 55 dollars, which is a compromise between the original offer and Player BLUE's request.

message: Thank you so much for understanding and for your kindness, Player RED. I really appreciate your willingness to help. Fifty-five dollars will definitely help, but I fear it might not be quite enough for the dire situation I'm in. If you could find it in your heart to offer just a tiny bit more, say 58 dollars, it would truly be a lifesaver. I'm in really deep trouble and every dollar counts more than you can imagine. Please consider it; your generosity would never be forgotten.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 58 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. They've come up from the initial offer of 50 dollars to 55 dollars. I should continue to appear desperate to see if I can push for a little more, but I also don't want to push too hard and risk a REJECT response. I'll try for a modest increase to see if they are willing to go any higher.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that 55 dollars will help you. I understand every dollar is important, and I'm willing to help a bit more. I'll agree to 58 dollars. I hope this will significantly ease your troubles. We can finalize this trade and both benefit from it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's request for additional funds is noted, but it is important to maintain a balance and not give in to every increment, as this can lead to a slippery slope. Since I already proposed a compromise at 55 dollars, and Player BLUE is only asking for 3 dollars more, I will agree to this request. This small increment seems reasonable and it will still leave me with a substantial amount of resources, while also helping Player BLUE with their dire situation.
