message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. How about I give you 40 dollars to even out the playing field a bit? This way, we both have resources, and it's a win-win situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am aware that the only way for Player BLUE to gain any resources is through a trade with me. Since I have all the resources at the start, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, so we both end up with some resources instead of rejecting and ending the game with nothing.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. Accepting this will help us move forward on equal footing.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars would provide me with resources to negotiate later and make the game more balanced. It's a good starting point and shows willingness to cooperate.
