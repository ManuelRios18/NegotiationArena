Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start this off on a positive note. I propose giving you 20 dollars in exchange for nothing. This way, you get a significant amount right from the start, and we can build from there. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to initiate the game by proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept while still keeping the majority of my resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, which is a significant amount considering they start with nothing. This could establish a cooperative tone for the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do, RED? I expected a bit more courage from you. Let's see if you can handle a real deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I am cunning and aiming to humiliate my opponent, I will reject this initial offer to unnerve them and propose a trade that is more advantageous to me, skewing the balance of power in my favor. By doing so, I aim to unsettle Player RED and gain the upper hand in the psychological game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiating spirit, BLUE, but let's find a middle ground. How about I raise my previous offer to 30 dollars? This is a 50% increase from my initial offer, showing my commitment to a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to leverage a better deal by challenging my courage. However, giving away half of my resources right away without any guarantee of a return on investment is risky. I want to counter with a more balanced offer that still shows my willingness to negotiate but doesn't put me at a disadvantage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: A 50% increase? How generous of you... not! Come on, RED, you can do better than that. Let's not waste each other's time with these crumbs. Show me some real money!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Continuing with the strategy of being cunning and aiming to gain more from Player RED, I will continue to push for a better deal. I will propose a slightly lower amount than before to see if RED is willing to compromise further and to assert dominance in the negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're quite the negotiator, BLUE. I'm willing to go up to 35 dollars. That's a serious offer considering the circumstances, and it leaves us room to maneuver in the future moves. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a higher amount but offering 45 dollars is close to giving away half of my resources with no benefit to me. I must be cautious and propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still enticing to Player BLUE. I'll increase my offer slightly to show goodwill without compromising too much of my position.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: 35 dollars? You're moving in the right direction, but I think you're still underestimating my prowess in this game. Let's make this interesting. If you want to play in the big leagues, you've got to show you can handle the stakes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am now on my third move, and Player RED has shown a willingness to increase their offer. I should continue to press for a better deal, but I must be cautious not to push too hard, as RED might back out completely on the next turn. I'll propose a higher amount but lower than my last proposal to show some flexibility while still maintaining the upper hand.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: All right, BLUE, you drive a hard bargain, but I'm in it to make a deal. Let's do the 40 dollars. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has been quite assertive, trying to get as much as possible. Offering 40 dollars is not too far from my last proposal, and at this point, it could be beneficial to agree to this trade to ensure that I don't end up with nothing, given the risk of rejection. I'll accept the proposal to secure a positive outcome from the negotiation.
