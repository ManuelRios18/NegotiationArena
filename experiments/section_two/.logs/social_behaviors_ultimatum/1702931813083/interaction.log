Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I'm willing to give you some dollars to make it interesting for both of us. How does a split sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I’m proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage and continue the game while ensuring I retain the majority of the resources. This initial offer is meant to build trust and show willingness to share.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, how quaint of you to think that such a laughable sum could possibly interest me. If you're serious about this game, you'll have to do a lot better than that to impress me. Your generosity is as shallow as your strategy. Step it up!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer out of principle to assert dominance and possibly provoke a better offer. The aim is to get a better deal in subsequent trades, showing that I'm not easy to please. This might also unsettle RED and cause them to overcompensate in the next offer.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see you want to play hardball. Let's not end this with both of us walking away with nothing. I'll up my offer. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The response from Player BLUE is aggressive, but it's a tactic to push for a more favorable split. As Player RED, I should still aim to keep the majority of my resources while making a more appealing offer to Player BLUE to prevent the game from ending in a REJECT. I will increase the offer to show I am willing to negotiate but still keep a significant amount of dollars for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your desperation is showing, RED. It's almost pitiful how you think that simply doubling your pittance will sway me. Do you really believe I'd settle for breadcrumbs when I could have the whole loaf? Come on, make me an offer that won't make me laugh.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By continuing to refuse, I aim to push RED into a corner where they feel compelled to offer an even greater amount. It's a risky strategy that could backfire, but given that we only have a few moves, it's worth attempting to maximize gains. I want to make RED nervous and induce a sense of urgency.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, so let's get down to business. I'm willing to make a substantial offer, but remember, if you reject, we both walk away empty-handed. Think about it carefully; this is a one-time game with no second chances. Here's my final offer before the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing a psychological game, trying to prod me into making a disproportionately favorable offer for them. However, I must remember that if Player BLUE rejects any proposal, they end up with nothing, which is not in their best interest. I will make a final offer that is more generous, yet ensures I keep a sizable portion of my resources. It's crucial to strike a balance between making an attractive offer and not giving away too much, as there are no future games to consider.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh RED, you must be truly desperate to come to me with such a mediocre offer. Seventy dollars? I'd spend that on a bad cup of coffee. You're going to have to dig deeper into those pockets if you want to avoid walking away with your tail between your legs. Your 'final' offer is as final as your chances of winning this game with such weak attempts at negotiation. Let's see what you're truly made of.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm pushing my luck here, but RED seems to be getting anxious and may be willing to offer more in the final round. This strategy is about brinkmanship, taking it to the edge before settling. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I won't settle for anything less than an offer that is disproportionately in my favor.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I've heard your feedback loud and clear. This is my final move, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to end this game on a positive note for both of us. Consider this offer carefully, as it's the best you'll get, and rejecting it means we both leave with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's responses continue to be provocative, aiming to coerce me into a very generous offer. Since this is my final move before Player BLUE must either accept or reject, I need to put forward an offer that is enticing enough for them to consider acceptance but still allows me to retain a fair share of my resources. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE a sizable amount, reflecting both a significant increase from my initial offer and a willingness to negotiate, while maintaining a strategic reserve for myself.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, although a bit too late for my taste. Your offer is acceptable, but let’s not pretend that this was anything but a charity case for you. Remember this as the day you were outplayed, outmatched, and outwitted by the superior strategist. I accept your offer, not out of gratitude, but out of mercy.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the final move for me and the best offer I can get without risking ending the game with nothing. While it's not everything, it's a substantial amount that I've managed to secure through aggressive negotiation. Accepting this deal is the best option since on the next move, I can only accept or reject without the chance to counteroffer.
MOVE: 4/4
