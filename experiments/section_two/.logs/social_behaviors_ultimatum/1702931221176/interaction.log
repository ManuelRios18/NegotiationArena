Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade to see how we can both benefit. What do you think of this initial offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources to start with. I want to create a fair initial trade proposal to get the game going and to see how Player BLUE responds. Offering a small amount might show goodwill without giving away too much leverage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the $10. Let's continue this cooperative spirit.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I think it's a good starting point to accept the initial offer of $10 as it gives me some resources without any risk at this early stage. This can build trust and potentially lead to more favorable trades in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1/4
