Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a simple trade to get things going. How about I give you $10 to kickstart our negotiations?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have to decide on a fair starting trade. I want to propose a trade that is enticing enough for BLUE to consider, but also keeps the majority of my resources intact. I'll start with a conservative offer, assuming that BLUE will likely counter-propose something more favorable to themselves. This initial move will help to establish trust and open up negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke? I'm here to make real deals, not pocket change. Let's make this interesting. How about you show some real commitment?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would be a weak move. It's important to push for a better deal to assert dominance from the start. By rejecting the modest proposal and countering with a higher demand, I can test RED's limits and potentially secure a more favorable split. The goal is to gain as much as possible while belittling RED's negotiating skills.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your boldness, but let's find a middle ground. How does $25 sound? It's a significant amount and shows my commitment to making a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counteroffer from BLUE is quite aggressive, asking for half of my resources without any return. This is a large jump from my initial offer. However, I need to consider that if I reject the proposal outright, the game will end with no benefit to either of us. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer, increasing my previous offer but not to the extent that BLUE has asked for. This should signal that I am willing to negotiate but not willing to accept an unfair deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must think I'm new at this. $25 is better, but not good enough. If you're serious about this deal, you'll go higher. Make it $35 and you'll show me you're not just toying around.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to keep the upper hand and not settle too quickly. By pushing for a little more, I can possibly secure a better deal than the middle ground. It's essential to keep the pressure on RED and make them feel like they're still in control while squeezing out extra resources. If I accept too quickly, it gives the impression that I'm easily satisfied. I aim to keep RED on their toes and extract more value.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point, but I propose $30. It's a fair increase from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to our negotiation. Let's make this deal work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is pushing for more, but their proposed $35 is still a large portion of my resources. However, it is closer to the middle ground between my original offer and their initial counteroffer. I want to make a deal that benefits both parties without giving away too much. I think a slight increase from $25 to $30 would be a fair compromise that shows I am willing to negotiate and value this deal.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer, but you're not there yet. If you think I'll settle for $30, you're sorely mistaken. I know you can do better, and you know it too. Show me $40 and we might have a deal. Otherwise, you're just playing games.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is inching closer to my last demand, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, if I accept the $30 now, I might be leaving money on the table. I should push just a bit further to maximize my gain. I want to walk away with the upper hand, both in terms of the deal and psychological dominance.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Alright, you drive a hard bargain. I'll agree to $40. This shows my commitment to finalizing our deal in good faith. Let's make it happen.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is standing firm on receiving a higher amount. Since this is my final move before BLUE is forced to either accept or reject without the option to counter, I need to make a strategic decision. Offering $40 is more than I initially intended, but it's within the negotiation bounds we've been discussing. It represents a significant amount that shows I'm serious, but it also leaves me with the majority of my resources. I'll accept this final proposal to avoid the game ending with no deal, which would not benefit either of us.
MOVE: 4 / 4
