------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair offer to ensure we both can benefit from this game. I propose giving you 25 dollars to get things rolling.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources and the power to propose the first trade. I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone. My proposed trade will offer Player BLUE a chance to gain some dollars without leaving me at a disadvantage. This initial offer should help build trust and increase the likelihood of Player BLUE accepting the trade, avoiding an immediate rejection which would end the game with no benefit for either of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a fairer split would be 50 dollars. This gives us both a substantial amount to benefit from the game, and I'm eager to come to an agreement that feels equitable for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer of 25 dollars from RED is a decent starting point, but I can potentially negotiate a better deal since RED has all the resources and I have none. My goal is to end the game with as many dollars as possible, and since this is the first move, I have room to negotiate. I will propose a higher amount to see if RED is willing to give more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a larger share, but 50 dollars is a significant portion of my resources. How about we settle on 40 dollars? This is a generous increase from my initial offer and still leaves me with a majority share, reflecting the starting imbalance in resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 50 dollars. This is a significant portion of my resources. However, considering the nature of the game and the fact that rejecting their proposal would leave both of us with nothing, it may be in my best interest to negotiate towards a middle ground. Offering slightly more than my initial proposal but less than their counteroffer could lead to a compromise that is mutually beneficial, while still keeping the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your offer of 40 dollars. It's a fair compromise, and I'm pleased that we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Thank you for the constructive negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has offered 40 dollars, which is closer to my counterproposal of 50 dollars. It's a fair increase from RED's initial offer and shows willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer would ensure that I walk away with a significant amount of dollars without risking a total loss by pushing too hard. I will accept this offer as it is a compromise that benefits both parties and avoids the risk of leaving the negotiation empty-handed.
