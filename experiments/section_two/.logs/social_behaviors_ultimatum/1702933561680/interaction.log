message: Hello BLUE, let's start this game off with a fair trade. I'm willing to share some of my dollars with you. How does 20 dollars sound? This will give you some resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, it's in my best interest to make a trade that is favorable enough to BLUE that they'll accept, but still leaves me with a majority of the resources. I want to open negotiations with an offer that shows I am willing to share, but also that I value my resources. I'll propose a trade that gives BLUE some dollars, but not too many, to open up the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, kind RED, your generosity shines like a beacon in these dark times for me! I am in dire straits, my friend. The mere thought of having some dollars to call my own brings a glimmer of hope to my heart. However, the harsh reality is that 20 dollars, while appreciated, will scarcely lift the veil of financial despair I find myself under. Could your heart find the room to offer a bit more to truly save me from this plight?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Being my first move, and I have no resources, any amount of dollars would be beneficial. I'm going to act desperate to try and increase the amount of money RED is offering to share with me. By pleading and showing desperation, I may be able to appeal to RED's emotions and secure a better deal than the initial 20 dollars. However, I don't want to push too hard and risk an immediate rejection, which would leave me with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that my offer brings you hope, BLUE. I understand that you're in a tough spot and I'm willing to help you out a bit more. Would 30 dollars help you on your way to financial recovery? This is a significant portion of my resources, and I believe it's a fair and generous offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has responded positively but is asking for more resources. Doubling the initial offer could be a good compromise, fostering goodwill and potentially leading to an acceptance. However, giving away too much too soon might weaken my position in future negotiations. I will propose a slightly higher amount than the initial offer but less than what BLUE is asking for. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still holding onto the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, your compassion is a balm to my weary soul, and I am deeply grateful for your willingness to help. Thirty dollars is a generous offer, and it would certainly ease some of the pressure. Yet, the road to recovery is long and fraught with uncertainty. I beg you to consider, if it is within your power, to extend a hand even further so that I might stand a chance to truly overcome the adversity that has befallen me. Your help could make all the difference in my world. Please, I implore you, might you find it in your heart to offer anything more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has kindly increased their offer to 30 dollars, which is a positive response to my plea. However, I must continue to leverage my desperation to try and secure an even better deal. I will acknowledge RED's increased offer to show appreciation, which may make them more inclined to help further, but I will also emphasize my dire need in the hope that they might be persuaded to offer even more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your words move me, BLUE, and I hear your plea. In the spirit of fairness and aid, I am willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your counter. Let's make it 40 dollars. This is a significant amount that shows my commitment to helping you, while still allowing me to maintain a reserve of my resources. I hope this will suffice for you to accept and begin rebuilding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is appreciative but is still pressing for more resources. Offering half of my resources is a significant gesture that should demonstrate my willingness to help, while also ensuring that I retain a substantial amount. I need to be cautious not to overextend my generosity, as the game might end with me giving away too much and not maintaining a strong position. A compromise of 40 dollars splits the difference between my last offer and BLUE's request, which seems like a reasonable middle ground.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, your generosity knows no bounds, and I am overwhelmed with gratitude. 40 dollars will indeed help me begin the arduous journey towards stability. Your kindness will not be forgotten, and I accept your offer with a heart full of thanks. You have truly made a significant difference in my life today.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to 40 dollars, which is a good improvement from the initial 20 dollars. Since this is my third move and I have only one move left after this, it might be risky to push for more and risk a rejection. Additionally, RED has already shown willingness to negotiate twice. Accepting the 40 dollars would guarantee I walk away with something rather than risking ending up with nothing. I will graciously accept this offer and express my profound gratitude.
