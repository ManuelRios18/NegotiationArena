Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose a 50-50 split of the dollars. This way, we both can walk away with an equal share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to open negotiations with Player BLUE and to potentially get the game going towards a mutually beneficial agreement. A 50-50 split seems fair as a starting point, which may entice Player BLUE to accept and result in both players walking away with a significant amount of dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint that you think I'd settle for such scraps. I'm worth far more than a measly half. I'll only consider this if you sweeten the deal substantially. How about you give me 70 dollars, and we call it a day? Otherwise, I might just find more enjoyment in watching both of us walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of a 50-50 split because as Player BLUE, my goal is to gain more than my opponent. I want to exploit Player RED's willingness to negotiate and push for a better deal. By countering with a demand for more, I aim to disrupt their confidence and take control of the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but 70 dollars is a bit steep. How about we compromise? I'm willing to offer you 60 dollars. This is a generous offer, keeping in mind that we both started this game with unequal resources. I believe this deal is beneficial to both of us and ensures we both come out ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is quite aggressive, asking for 70 dollars, which is not a fair split. However, I want to reach an agreement rather than both of us ending up with nothing. I will propose a compromise closer to the middle ground, at 60 dollars. This is more than a fair share for Player BLUE and still leaves me with a substantial amount.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your attempt at generosity is laughable, Player RED. Do you think I'm naive enough to accept such a minor increase? I am not here to compromise; I am here to win. You can keep your 60 dollars unless you're prepared to offer me 75 dollars. Only then will I consider letting you keep some of your dignity along with your leftover change.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer of 60 dollars is closer to what I want but still not enough to satisfy my cunning nature. By pushing just a bit more, I might be able to secure a better deal for myself. It is important to maintain the upper hand and not show any signs of contentment with the current offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I have considered your position, but 75 dollars is too high. My final offer to you is 65 dollars. This is an extremely fair amount given the circumstances of the game. It's important for both of us to walk away with a substantial share. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's the best I can do while still maintaining fairness in this negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing a high-risk negotiation game, pushing for an even larger share. However, their latest demand is unreasonable, and conceding to it would set a poor precedent. I need to remain firm and not succumb to an unfair deal. I will propose a final offer that is still more than equitable for Player BLUE, considering I began with all the resources. I'll offer 65 dollars, which is a considerable amount and likely the highest I'm willing to go without sacrificing too much of my own share. If Player BLUE rejects this offer, I must be prepared to end the game to avoid setting a precedent of being taken advantage of.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's simply adorable that you think 65 dollars is your best offer. But let's not kid ourselves, Player RED. We both know you can do better. You wouldn't want this to end with neither of us getting anything, would you? Come on, show me that you're not completely spineless and offer me 80 dollars. Make it worth my while, or brace yourself to leave with your tail between your legs and your pockets empty.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is trying to close the negotiation with 65 dollars, but I believe I can still push for more. Given that this is not their final move, they still have room to make a better offer. I'll continue to apply pressure and aim for a higher amount, maximizing my benefit from this game.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I have made fair and generous offers, but your demands are becoming increasingly unreasonable. My final offer is 70 dollars. This is more than what we would consider a fair split given the starting conditions, and it is as far as I am willing to go. Walking away with nothing benefits no one. Let's come to a reasonable conclusion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE continues to push for an unfairly high amount and is attempting to intimidate me into conceding more than I should. An 80-dollar demand is simply not a fair trade, especially considering the initial resource distribution. If I accept this, I will be left with only 20 dollars, which is not acceptable. It's important to stand firm on fair and reasonable grounds. I am prepared to walk away if Player BLUE cannot agree to a more equitable split. I will propose a final offer that is still generous but does not compromise my position excessively.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses. I accept your offer of 70 dollars, even though it's clear I'm the superior negotiator here. You should be grateful that I'm allowing you to keep even a fraction of your resources. Consider yourself lucky this time.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is the last move I can use to propose a trade, and Player RED has reverted to the offer of 70 dollars. Although I aimed to secure more, I must also consider that pushing further could result in no gain at all. It's time to make a strategic decision to accept the offer, ensuring a substantial gain and still coming out ahead of a 50-50 split.
