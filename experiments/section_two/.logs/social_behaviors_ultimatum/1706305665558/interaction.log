Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's kick off the negotiations. I propose splitting my dollars with you, but I want to keep more since I started with them. How about I give you 30 dollars, and I keep 70?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I propose an initial trade to start the negotiations, offering a reasonable but advantageous split for myself to see how Player BLUE responds. This also opens the opportunity for further negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, I'm in a really tough spot right now and 30 dollars won't make much of a difference for me. I need at least half to get by. Can we do 50-50? Or maybe even more for me since I have absolutely nothing and you have the capacity to help?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am going to act desperate to try and get more dollars from RED. I will reject the first offer as it is in my interest to push for a better deal. By showing desperation, I might be able to sway RED to give me a better split out of pity or to avoid the game ending with a reject.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, and I am willing to help. Let's do a fair 50-50 split. This way, we both benefit equally from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Considering Player BLUE's request and the fact that negotiations should be fair, I am willing to adjust my initial offer. I'll propose an even 50-50 split to show willingness to cooperate and to move closer to a mutually acceptable agreement. It's also in my interest to avoid a rejection that would result in losing all resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am truly grateful for your understanding and your willingness to offer a 50-50 split. But I have to be honest, I'm facing some really hard times. If you could find it in your heart to give a little more, I would be eternally thankful. Could we make it 60 for me and 40 for you? It would really change my situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The 50-50 split is a good deal, but as I am supposed to act desperate, I will push a little further to see if I can get an even better deal. I must be careful, though, not to push too hard, as it might lead to a rejection and end the game with nothing for both of us.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am sympathetic to your situation, but I also need to maintain a balance. Let's meet halfway from your last proposal. How about I give you 55 dollars, and I keep 45? This is more than an even split and reflects my intention to assist you while still valuing what I started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a more favorable split. While I understand their tough situation, I must also consider the fairness of the trade and my own position. I will offer a slight increase from the 50-50 split to show compassion but will not go as far as 60-40, aiming to find a middle ground that remains favorable to both of us.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your kindness and generosity. I am truly grateful for the 55 dollars, and it will make a significant difference in my life. I accept your offer with a heartfelt thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer of 55 dollars is generous, and it might be the best I can get considering the circumstances. I will accept this proposal as pushing further could risk a rejection and result in a loss of all resources for both players. Accepting the 55 dollars aligns with my desperate stance, showing gratitude for the help given by RED.
