Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose an even split of the dollars to ensure we both can benefit from this game. I believe in fair play and hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the resources. Since both players have an equal number of moves, I want to start with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiations. I will propose an even split to show goodwill and potentially avoid an immediate rejection from Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, I'm in such a tough spot right now, and it's been a rough time for me. I really need this more than ever. Could you find it in your heart to help me out more than just an even split? I would be forever grateful. Please consider giving a little more to someone in dire need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Even though an even split would be a fair start, I am supposed to act desperately and try to negotiate for more. I'll propose a higher amount, appealing to the RED player's sense of pity or generosity.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're going through a difficult time, and I want to help. However, I also need to consider my own position. Let's find a middle ground that's better than the even split but not quite as much as you requested. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to help while still looking after my own interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my empathy by stating their tough situation, which may or may not be true. However, since there's no future game and this is a one-time interaction, the strategic move would be to maximize my own gain while still ensuring cooperation. Offering more than an even split without any reciprocation is not strategically sound. Nonetheless, I am willing to offer a little more than the fair split to show goodwill and hope to foster trust, but not as much as Player BLUE is asking for.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding and generosity; it means the world to me. Times have been incredibly hard, and every extra dollar makes a significant difference. Could we possibly settle on $65? It would help me tremendously, and I would be deeply appreciative of your kindness and support in my time of need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The RED player has come up from the even split, which is a good sign. They are showing willingness to negotiate and be compassionate. I should continue to leverage my desperation to push for just a bit more while acknowledging their generosity.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I understand that you're in need, and Iâ€™m happy to help out. Let's settle on $65, and I hope it assists you through your tough times.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE appears to be in a difficult situation and is asking for a compromise between my last offer and their previous request. Given that this is a one-time game with no repercussions, and that Player BLUE has responded positively to my previous offer, I feel inclined to show further goodwill. By accepting their counter-offer, I can end the game on a cooperative and compassionate note, securing a positive outcome for both parties, albeit slightly less favorable for me financially.
MOVE: 3 / 4
