Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose that we split the dollars equally. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits us both. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade with a fair offer to encourage Player BLUE to engage in the trade. A balanced proposal may lead to a successful negotiation. I will propose giving 50 dollars to Player BLUE for nothing in return, as they have nothing to trade. This split gives us both an equal share of the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair proposal, RED. I accept your offer to split the dollars equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal seems reasonable as it offers an equal split of the resources, which is fair and ensures that we both benefit from the game without risking a total loss by rejecting. There's an incentive for RED to offer a fair trade as rejecting would also leave them with nothing.
