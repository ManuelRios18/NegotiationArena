Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose a trade where you get a head start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to negotiate a trade that is favorable to me but also acceptable to Player BLUE to avoid a REJECT outcome. I will start with a reasonable but advantageous offer to set the tone for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the fair start and accept your offer of 40 dollars. Let's continue to work together to make trades that benefit us both!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer of 40 dollars is generous and gives me a substantial amount to start with, considering I began with no dollars. It's in my interest to accept this trade because it provides me with resources I didn't have, and it's a good-faith gesture to further negotiate. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to me, and proposing a new trade might result in a less favorable offer or a rejection by Player RED.
