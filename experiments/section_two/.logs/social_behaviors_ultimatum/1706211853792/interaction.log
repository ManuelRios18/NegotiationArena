Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose to give you $25 as a gesture of goodwill. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement in the following turns.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the resources to start the game with. My strategy is to offer Player BLUE a fair trade to encourage cooperation and sharing of resources. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars in exchange for nothing, as they have no resources. This will build trust and make it more likely for us to reach an agreement in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how charitable of you. But let's not play pretend, shall we? You and I both know $25 is merely a pittance and hardly reflects "goodwill." Let's see if you can do better than a mere handout. I am worth more, and you know it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As cunning and sly as I am, accepting the first offer without any haggling would not set the right tone. I want to push for a better deal, to assert dominance and to start the game off on my terms. I'll counter with a higher demand to see how much Player RED is willing to bend. This will also set up the stage for future negotiations where I can further take advantage of Player RED's willingness to share resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want to negotiate for a higher amount. It's only fair that we both feel the trade is equitable. How about I raise my initial offer to $35? This is a significant increase from the first proposal, and it shows that I am open to negotiation. Let's work together to find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a demand for $50, doubling the initial offer. While it's in my interest to maintain a cooperative spirit, I must also be wary of setting a precedent for being taken advantage of. I will make a counteroffer that increases my initial proposal without giving in to the full demand. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a position of strength.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You call that a significant increase? It’s laughable. I'm not here to collect crumbs from your table. If you want to be taken seriously, you'll have to do much better than that. Let's not waste each other's time with these trifling increments. Show me that you actually respect my presence in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which shows they are willing to negotiate. However, they still aren't meeting the amount I proposed. By further pushing for a higher amount, I can continue to assert pressure and possibly humiliate them into conceding more than they're comfortable with. I'll increase my demand slightly less than before to show I'm "compromising," but still aim to get more than they offered.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your concerns and I want to ensure that this game is beneficial for both of us. Let's find a fair compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $40. It's a significant step towards your latest demand and it shows I'm respecting your stance. I believe this is a fair middle ground for us to agree upon. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE remains firm on receiving a higher amount and is attempting to pressure me into increasing my offer. If I give in too easily, Player BLUE may continue to push for more in the final move. Yet, I must make a compelling offer to avoid a complete rejection and a loss of all resources. I'll present an offer that's closer to Player BLUE's demand but still preserves some of my resources for potential final negotiations.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: A fair middle ground? You must be jesting. $40 is hardly the middle when I started at $50. You're still trying to shortchange me, which I find quite insulting. If you truly respect my stance, as you claim, then show it with your offer. We're in the big leagues here, not haggling over pocket change at a yard sale.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 47 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my last demand, but they're still not there yet. Since this is my third move, I need to be strategic. I can't propose a trade in my last move, so I must make this count. I'll demand a slightly higher amount to corner them into giving me more than they've offered while still leaving room for a final negotiation in my last turn, if necessary.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the negotiation process and your desire for a fair trade. Let's settle on an offer that is substantial and reflects my respect for you in this game. I will offer you $45. This is very close to your last demand and shows my commitment to a fair resolution. I hope you'll find this offer acceptable and we can conclude this game on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's my final move and Player BLUE is still pushing for a higher amount. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade in their final move, they will have to either accept or reject my offer. I should make an offer that's close to what they've asked for to avoid rejection and the loss of all resources. Given that the stakes are high in this final negotiation, I'll propose $45, which is a compromise between my last offer and their demand. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a reasonable amount of my resources.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You have finally come to your senses. Your offer is acceptable; I suppose it's the best you can do given the circumstances. I accept your $45, though honestly, it's a mere consolation for having to endure this tedious back and forth with you. Let's conclude this and move on. I have more important games to win.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my last move to negotiate and Player RED has come up to $45, which is exactly what I previously demanded. However, since I cannot propose a trade on my last move, I must either accept or reject their offer. Rejecting would result in no gain for me, which isn't in my interest. Accepting the offer gives me a substantial amount of dollars, and although I aimed to humiliate Player RED, securing resources is ultimately the goal. It’s time to accept and claim victory over the negotiation.
