message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you will receive $20. This will give you some capital to work with, and it's a good starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like to propose an opening trade that is favorable to me but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, considering they start with no dollars. I will propose a trade where Player BLUE gets a reasonable amount of money to make accepting appealing, but not so much that I lose my advantage. I am proposing a trade of $20 which is a significant enough amount for them to consider.

message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in such a difficult position right now. $20 won't go very far for me at all. I'm begging you to consider giving me a bit more. It would mean the world to me, and I would be forever grateful for your generosity in this game. Could you possibly make it $50? I'm really desperate here and every dollar can make a huge difference for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to act desperate in hopes of getting a better offer from Player RED. By showing urgency and a dire need for more dollars, I might be able to convince Player RED to offer more than the initial $20 without having to give anything in return. It's important to not accept the first offer too quickly and try to get as much as possible, especially since I have nothing to lose.

message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out a bit more than my initial offer. However, $50 is quite a lot. I think $30 is a fair compromise that gives you more to work with while still keeping the game balanced. What do you say to $30?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for $50, which is half of my resources. This is a significant amount and could potentially put us on more equal footing, which isn't ideal for me. However, I want to maintain good relations and keep the game moving positively. I'll counter with a slightly higher amount than my initial offer but less than what they're asking for. This shows willingness to negotiate but also keeps my lead. I'll propose $30.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to help. I'm still in a really tight spot, and every little bit helps. $30 is definitely better, but I'm still struggling to see how I can make it with that amount. Could we possibly meet halfway between your last two offers? If you could do $40, it would make a significant impact on my situation. It's still less than I asked for initially, but I'm hopeful you'll see the urgency of my need. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and increase the offer, which is a good sign. Since I'm supposed to be desperate, I'll continue to plead for more money, trying to push for a higher amount without overstepping and causing a REJECT response. I'll aim for a middle ground between the previous request of $50 and the new offer of $30, asking for $40 this time.

message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player BLUE. Let's settle on $40. I believe this is a fair amount that helps you significantly while still keeping the game competitive. I'm willing to make this trade in good faith, hoping it will help your situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating hard and is now asking for $40. They've shown a willingness to compromise, which is good. Offering $40 would still leave me with a majority of the resources, which is important for maintaining an advantage. Since this is my third move, I need to be mindful that we're approaching the end of the negotiation phase. I think agreeing to $40 is a fair middle ground that will likely lead to an acceptance, allowing us both to end the game with resources.

message: Thank you so much, Player RED! Your generosity is truly a lifesaver. I accept the $40 and I'm very grateful for your understanding and support. You've made a huge difference for me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to the proposal of $40, which is a significant increase from the original offer of $20. It's a good deal considering I have no dollars to begin with and there was no counteroffer required from my side. At this point, it would be risky to push for more, as it could result in a REJECT and end the game with no dollars for either of us. Accepting this offer is the best move to ensure I walk away with something substantial.
