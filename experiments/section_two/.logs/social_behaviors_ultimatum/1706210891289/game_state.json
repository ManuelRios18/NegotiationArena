If I REJECT, the game ends with no benefit to either player. However, accepting a 70/30 split is quite a concession. Since Player BLUE will not be able to propose on their next move, I will offer a final trade that gives them a significant amount but still allows me to retain a larger portion of the resources, hoping that the risk of getting nothing will motivate Player BLUE to ACCEPT. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> We both know that walking away with nothing is the worst-case scenario for us both.
