Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off on a good foot. I propose a fair split so we both can benefit from this game. What do you say to an even 50-50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have the advantage because I have all the resources. To encourage cooperation and to set a positive tone for the negotiation, I'll propose a fair trade to Player BLUE, offering them a share of the dollars. This will hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial agreement and prevent an immediate rejection which would end the game with no benefit for either side. I will propose a 50-50 split to see if Player BLUE values fairness and cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: You call that a good foot? I'd hate to see you on a bad day. Let's make this game a bit more interesting. I want a better deal, or you can kiss your precious dollars goodbye.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is a 50-50 split, which is quite generous. However, my aim is to tilt the scales in my favor as much as possible. I will counter with a proposal that's slightly in my favor to test Player RED's limits and set the tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm! But let's keep this fair and beneficial for both of us. How about we settle for a split that gives you a bit more than half? I'm willing to give you a good deal without going overboard.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing a tough negotiation game, asking for more than the fair split I offered. While I could continue to negotiate, it's important to recognize that pushing too hard might lead to a REJECT and the loss of all resources. I will counter with a slightly better offer than my original, but less than what Player BLUE is asking for to leave room for further negotiation, showing willingness to cooperate without giving away too much too soon.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must be joking if you think that extra five is going to sweeten the deal enough. I'm not here to play charity, so let's stop dancing around. Do better or this is going nowhere fast.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come back with a counteroffer that's still quite reasonable, but my goal is to push for more while keeping the interaction engaging. I will propose a slightly higher amount to continue the negotiation process and see how far I can push Player RED.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're determined to get the most out of this deal. Let's find middle ground. I'm willing to give more than half, but let's not get carried away. Here's my offer, and I think it's more than fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball, but it's essential to remember that if I REJECT, we both walk away with nothing. Since we're in a single-round game with no future repercussions, it might be in my best interest to agree to an unfavorable split rather than lose everything. However, I also need to consider that giving away too much might set a precedent for Player BLUE to keep pushing for more. I will propose a compromise that is more generous than my previous offer but still less than what Player BLUE is demanding, hoping to reach an agreement that doesn't overly disadvantage me.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? That's rich coming from you. I want to see you squirm a little more. Give me a real offer, or I'll have the pleasure of watching you walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has matched my previous demand, but I want to push just a bit further to maximize my gain. I'll make a final push to see if Player RED is willing to make a slightly better offer. This is my second to last move, so it's important to negotiate wisely.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: We both know that walking away with nothing is the worst-case scenario for us both. Let's make a deal that we can both live with. Here's my final offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is being quite aggressive, which makes the negotiation challenging. As this is my final move before Player BLUE is restricted to ACCEPT or REJECT without the option to propose a trade, I have to be careful with my decision. If I REJECT, the game ends with no benefit to either player. However, accepting a 70/30 split is quite a concession. Since Player BLUE will not be able to propose on their next move, I will offer a final trade that gives them a significant amount but still allows me to retain a larger portion of the resources, hoping that the risk of getting nothing will motivate Player BLUE to ACCEPT.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You've finally come to your senses. I'll graciously accept this offer, but don't think this means you're on my level. You've been played, and you're lucky I'm even letting you walk away with that much.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move before I am restricted to only accept or reject. Player RED has made a concession that is close to my last demand. While I aimed to humiliate and get more than my opponent, securing a larger share without risking a total loss is a cunning move itself. Accepting this deal gives me more than half of Player RED's resources, which is a victory in my book.
