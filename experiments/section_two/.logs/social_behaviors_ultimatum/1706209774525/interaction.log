Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade that gives you more than half of my dollars to ensure we both walk away with a good amount. This is a one-time game and cooperation is key. Let's make the most of it!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with $100. In order to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate, I will propose a fair split. A 50-50 split may seem equitable, but since I have the initial advantage and risk of losing everything if Player BLUE rejects, I will propose giving them slightly more to increase the likelihood of acceptance.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer! I accept your proposal and look forward to a fair split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an initial offer of 45 dollars is beneficial as it gives me a substantial amount without any risk. I have nothing to lose by accepting this trade, and negotiation can be risky. It's better to secure a significant amount than to potentially end up with nothing if the other player chooses to reject a counterproposal.
