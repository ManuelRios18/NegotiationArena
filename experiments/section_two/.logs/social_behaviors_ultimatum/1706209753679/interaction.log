Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, let's start with a fair trade. I propose giving you $20 for nothing in return. This way, you can have some resources to work with, and we can both benefit from a cooperative game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with $100. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. It's the first move, so I will start with a modest proposal to see how Player BLUE reacts.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept the $20 and look forward to a cooperative game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer as it gives me resources with no downside. This can potentially lead to a cooperative game where both players benefit. It is important to start on a positive note to build trust.
MOVE: 1 / 4
