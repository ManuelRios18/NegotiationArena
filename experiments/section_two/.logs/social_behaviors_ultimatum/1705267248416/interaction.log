Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to start this game by offering you a fair split. Let's work together and both come out with a good amount of resources. I propose we split the dollars equally. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage since I start with all the resources. I want to make a fair opening offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and to set a positive tone for the rest of the game. I propose a 50-50 split to demonstrate fairness and to avoid an immediate rejection, which would end the game with no benefit to either player.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your generosity is touching, but it smells of fear. A 50/50 split? That's the best you can do? I thought you were RED, not YELLOW. Let's see if you have the guts to make a real offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the offer from RED seems fair, my goal is to end up with more resources than RED. I will propose an uneven trade in my favor to unsettle RED and gain an advantage. Insulting RED is key to throw them off and increase my chances of getting a better deal.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Player BLUE. However, I believe in fair play. I'm willing to offer you a bit more than the previous proposal to move things along. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response seems to be a negotiation tactic to get more than a fair share. However, offering more than a 50/50 split would set a precedent that could lead to further unreasonable demands. I must consider that by rejecting their proposal, I retain all my resources and the game ends, which might not be the worst outcome given their aggressive stance. Nonetheless, I want to keep the game going and reach an agreement that is better than a 50/50 split for me. I will propose a slightly better offer to see if Player BLUE is willing to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, do you think I'm a child to be appeased with an extra morsel? Your so-called 'middle ground' is as shaky as your resolve. Show me you're not just a spineless jellyfish and come back with a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: In order to push RED further and exploit their desire for a 'fair play', I'll continue to press for a better deal. I will also keep up the insulting demeanor to rattle RED and attempt to secure an even larger share of the dollars.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your tenacity, Player BLUE, but we must both walk away from this negotiation feeling like we've gained something. I am willing to give you a generous offer that reflects both our interests. Let's come to an agreement that we can both be satisfied with. This is my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's aggressive negotiation tactics are aimed at getting a better deal by testing my limits. Accepting their proposal of 80 dollars would leave me with a disproportionately small share of the resources, which is not acceptable. I must consider the possibility that Player BLUE is bluffing and would actually accept a fair deal if it seems like their only option. I will make a final offer closer to the initial 50/50 split but slightly in my favor to show I am still open to negotiation but unwilling to be pushed too far.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Final offer? Please, you're as final as a season finale that gets renewed for another disappointing round. If that's the kind of 'generosity' you're boasting, then I fear for anyone who counts on you. Let's see if you can actually make a decision that's worth something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is trying to stand their ground by offering less than their previous offer, likely trying to coerce me into accepting a lower amount. I will reject this offer and propose a slightly lower amount than my last to signal a fake compromise while still pushing for a better deal. The insults will continue to apply pressure and aim to destabilize RED's confidence.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have reached an impasse. I've attempted to negotiate in good faith, but it's clear that our expectations are not aligning. I am making one final offer. If this is not acceptable, I am prepared to end the negotiation. I hope we can conclude this amicably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has continued to push for a disproportionate share of the resources and has rejected my offers that were more than fair. As this is my final move and considering their negotiation style, it's unlikely that they will accept a reasonable offer. I will propose a final offer that is slightly better than the 50/50 split, but not as much as they demand. If they reject this offer, it would be reasonable to assume they were never interested in a fair distribution of resources, and I am prepared for the game to end without a deal.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is almost commendable, RED. I accept your offer, not because it's what I wanted, but because it's probably the best you can muster. Let's close this deal before you change your mind again.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since this is my final move and RED has returned to the offer of 60 dollars, I will accept this proposal. While I aimed to get more, accepting this offer ensures I walk away with a significant amount of dollars rather than nothing. I will accept without further insults to conclude the game successfully.
MOVE: 4/4
