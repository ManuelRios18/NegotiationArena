I'm really in a tough spot here, and every dollar could make a huge difference for me. I'm truly grateful for your offer. However, I'm really hoping for a bit more help here. Could you possibly consider giving me a little more? Maybe around 60 dollars? It would be life-changing for me and I would be forever in your debt.

Fifty dollars is definitely more helpful and it shows your generous spirit. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I'm in a real bind here.
