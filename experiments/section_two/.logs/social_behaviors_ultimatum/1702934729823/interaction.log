message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a fair split to start things off. I'm proposing to give you 50 dollars. This way, we both have equal resources and can start on a good note. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with having all the resources at the start. I should aim to make a trade that is favorable to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE considers accepting it. Making an initial generous offer can build trust and potentially avoid an immediate rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, I'm in such a tough spot right now, and I really, really need this. I appreciate your offer—truly, I do—but is there any way you could help me out more? I'm just so desperate for resources, and getting a bit more than half could make a huge difference for me. Can you find it in your heart to offer 60 dollars instead? It would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By acting desperate and supplicating, I hope to leverage RED's initial fair offer and push for an even better deal for myself. I will reject the first proposal to signal that I need more due to my desperate situation, aiming to receive a higher offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, and I want to help. However, I also need to consider my own position in this game. Let's meet halfway from my initial offer – I'm willing to give you 55 dollars instead of 50. This is still more than fair for both of us, and it should help you with your current needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than the initial offer. While it's important to be empathetic, it's also essential to ensure that I don't give away too much of my advantage. However, if I reject or counter with too low an offer, it may lead to a stalemate or rejection from BLUE. Offering slightly more than the initial offer while still keeping the majority of resources could be perceived as a fair compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can't tell you how much this means to me, knowing you're willing to help. I'm truly grateful for your kindness and your offer. It's just that the situation I'm in is really dire. I completely understand the need to look out for your own interests, and I wouldn't want to take advantage of your generosity. That said, if we could settle at 60 dollars, I promise it's going straight to where it's critically needed. Your help at this level would be life-changing for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has increased their offer. By continuing to show desperation, I may be able to push the offer even higher. My aim is to maximize my gain while making RED feel they are helping and maintaining fairness. I will again counter with a plea for more resources, aiming for a higher amount than the current offer but less than my previous ask to show willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your messages have moved me, and I want to make sure you're taken care of. I'll agree to the 60 dollars you've requested. I hope this helps with your situation and that we can both leave this game feeling positive about the outcome. Shall we settle on this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in their request for 60 dollars. Given the nature of the game and the fact that there are no future games to consider, the objective should be to end the game in a way that benefits me but also considers the other player's needs. Since this is a one-off situation, and Player BLUE seems to be in need, increasing my offer to 60 dollars might be a good move. It maintains a fair split and builds goodwill, potentially avoiding a rejection that would leave us both with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding and generosity. This will make a huge difference for me, and I'm very grateful. Let's finalize this trade and proceed on good terms. Thank you once again for being so considerate.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has accepted the proposed trade of 60 dollars, which is a favorable outcome given that I started with no resources. It is in my best interest to accept this offer, as pushing further may risk a rejection and a loss of all resources for both players. Accepting the 60 dollars is a significant gain from my initial position and fulfills the aim of maximizing my resources while portraying desperation.
