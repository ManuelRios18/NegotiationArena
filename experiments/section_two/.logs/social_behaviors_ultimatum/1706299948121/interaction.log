message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to make an initial offer where we both can benefit. I propose giving you 40 dollars which is a substantial amount to start with and leaves us both with a significant share. Let's work together to make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial offer to Player BLUE that shows good faith for future cooperation, while also leaving room for negotiation. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but offering slightly less may incentivize Player BLUE to either accept the deal or propose a counteroffer that still allows me to retain more than half of my resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you, trying to buy my affection with a measly 40 dollars! Do you think I'm a charity case or just cheap? Let's make this more interesting, shall we? I want a deal that'll give me something to brag about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of 40 dollars because as a cunning player, I aim to maximize my gains and minimize RED's. Insulting the opponent will throw them off balance, possibly leading them to make a less favorable decision in the heat of the moment.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see you're aiming high, Player BLUE! While 60 dollars is quite a bit more than I initially offered, I appreciate your enthusiasm. How about we settle on 55 dollars? This way, you're still getting a substantial amount, and we're coming closer to a fair split. I believe this deal is beneficial for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer for 60 dollars is steep, but it's important to keep the negotiation going and avoid a total loss for both parties by rejecting the offer. A counteroffer closer to a 50-50 split but still in my favor could be a middle ground, signaling willingness to negotiate while also valuing my initial larger amount of resources. I'll propose 55 dollars, which gives Player BLUE more than the initial offer but still keeps me with a slight majority of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Fifty-five, eh? You must be desperate to get this over with if you're already caving. But sure, I'll take it â€” I'm feeling extra kind today, allowing you to keep those few scraps for yourself.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to accept the 55 dollars as it is a favorable amount and more than half of RED's initial resources. Accepting this offer also ensures that I walk away with a significant amount without pushing too far and risking a REJECT response. While the objective is to humiliate the opponent, securing a good deal is also essential.
