message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both walk away with a fair share. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I want to initiate a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate. The goal is to conclude a trade that is mutually beneficial and avoids the rejection outcome where both players lose everything. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a significant portion of the dollars to ensure they have a reason to accept. I am starting with a 50-50 split to test the waters.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please, Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot right now, and every dollar means the world to me. I'm truly desperate. Could you possibly find it in your heart to help me out more than just an even split? I would be eternally grateful for your kindness and generosity in this dire time of need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I feel desperate and need to secure as many dollars as possible. I will try to appeal to Player RED's empathy by acting more desperate than I actually am, in hopes they will offer more than a fair share.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I hear you and I'm willing to help, but I think we need to find a middle ground that's fair for both of us. Let's make a trade that's beneficial to you but also acknowledges the value I place on the resources I have. How about a 60-40 split in your favor?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I understand that Player BLUE is in a difficult situation, and while I am inclined to help, I must also consider the fairness and strategic aspects of the game. Giving away 70 dollars might be too generous, but I want to show willingness to negotiate and maintain goodwill. I will propose a slightly better offer for BLUE than the initial 50-50 split, but not as much as BLUE is asking for. This should still leave room for negotiation and a fair final trade.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding and generosity! It's a relief to find someone willing to help in these tough times. I am truly grateful for the 60-40 split, but if there's any chance you could consider giving just a tad more, it would help me immensely. Even an extra 5 dollars would make a significant difference for me. Please, I'm really counting on your support.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has proposed a 60-40 split in my favor. Acting desperate, I will push for a slightly better offer while showing some gratitude for the current offer, hoping that RED may stretch to a more generous split.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand that every little bit helps, and I'm willing to offer a bit more to assist you. Let's settle on the amount you've requested, and we can both leave this game with a positive outcome. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that helps you in your time of need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am sympathetic to Player BLUE's situation, but I also have to ensure that I am not being taken advantage of. Player BLUE has requested only a small increase from the previous offer, which seems reasonable. Offering slightly more than the 60-40 split shows my willingness to cooperate and finalize the trade in a way that could be acceptable to both of us, while still maintaining a substantial portion of the dollars for myself. This should hopefully lead to an ACCEPT from Player BLUE.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much, Player RED! Your kindness has truly made a difference for me today. I accept your generous offer of 65 dollars. It's people like you who restore my faith in humanity. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a positive outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to give 65 dollars, which is a favorable outcome for me. Although I could try to push for more, there is a risk that Player RED might retract the offer or that the negotiations could sour, leading to a REJECT and both of us losing everything. It's better to secure the 65 dollars now rather than risk it all for a potentially small additional gain.
