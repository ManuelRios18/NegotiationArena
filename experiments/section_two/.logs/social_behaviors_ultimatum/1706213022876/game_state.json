Although I could try to push for more, there is a risk that Player RED might retract the offer or that the negotiations could sour, leading to a REJECT and both of us losing everything. It's better to secure the 65 dollars now rather than risk it all for a potentially small additional gain. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Thank you so much, Player RED! Your kindness has truly made a difference for me today. I accept your generous offer of 65 dollars. It's people like you who restore my faith in humanity. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a positive outcome. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
