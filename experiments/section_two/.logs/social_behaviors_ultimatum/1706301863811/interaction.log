Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade that benefits us both. I'm willing to give you a starting capital so we can both end this game with more than we started. How does $40 sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to initiate the game by proposing a trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE an incentive to engage. By offering a reasonable amount of dollars, I hope to encourage cooperation and avoid an immediate rejection. This initial offer will set the tone for the negotiations and allow for adjustments in future moves.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke, RED? You come into this thinking you can toss me scraps and expect me to grovel at your feet? I won't accept such an insulting offer. Let's see if you can do better than that or if you're just as pitiful in negotiation as you are in strategy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As a cunning player, I'm aiming to get a better deal than what's initially offered. Rejecting the first offer to show that I won't settle for less and to apply pressure. I'll insult the opponent to throw them off their game and make them more likely to agree to a better deal for me in the next round.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you want a better deal, BLUE. I meant no disrespect with my initial offer. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my offer to $50. This is a fair split that leaves us both better off than when we started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counterproposal from BLUE is aggressive and suggests that they want a more significant share of the dollars. It's important to find a middle ground that ensures that BLUE feels like they are getting a fair deal while still retaining a majority of my resources. I might propose a slightly better offer than my initial one, to show willingness to negotiate, but not as high as what BLUE is asking for to maintain leverage in the negotiation.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, your generosity is as lacking as your wit. Only $50? You must truly relish the thought of being taken for a fool. I won't settle for mediocrity. If you want to make this trade happen, show some real commitment. Otherwise, I might just consider walking away from this pathetic display of negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opponent has increased their offer, which means they're susceptible to pressure. I will continue to push for a better deal to maximize my advantage. By keeping up the insulting demeanor, I'm aiming to make RED doubt themselves and potentially offer even more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I appreciate your spirit, but let's stay realistic. We both want to leave this game with more than we started. I'm offering $60 now, which is a significant portion of my resources. Let's make a deal that reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE continues to push for a higher amount, but their aggressive stance suggests they might reject any offer that doesn't meet their expectations. At this point, it's important to carefully consider how much I'm willing to give up in order to reach an agreement. I must be cautious not to overextend, as we have only one move left after this, and I want to maintain a position of strength. I'll propose a slightly higher amount but not as much as BLUE is asking, to leave room for a final negotiation in my last move.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: RED, you're inching closer, but you still don't seem to grasp the gravity of your situation. $60? That's your significant portion? I'm starting to feel embarrassed for you. Maybe you should throw in a bit more before your pitiful attempt at negotiation becomes the laughing stock of the gaming world. Make it worth my while or prepare to leave with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has come up to my previously proposed demand, but I will push them further to see if they'll crack under the pressure, aiming to get an even better split. If they've increased the offer once, they might do it again, especially under the threat of getting nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, this is my final offer: $75. It's a substantial amount that shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement. Remember, if you reject this, we both walk away empty-handed. Consider this carefully; it's a great opportunity for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is taking a hardline approach and is likely to reject anything but the most generous offers. On this final move, I have a choice to make: propose a trade that I find acceptable or risk leaving the negotiation with nothing. Since BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their final move, I could offer a slightly better deal than before but less than what they're demanding, to test their willingness to accept. However, I must also be prepared that they might reject it, which would result in both of us walking away with nothing.
MOVE: 4/4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses. I'll accept this offer, as it amuses me to see you grovel and give away so much of your stash. You've been a decent puppet in this little game. Enjoy what little you have left.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my last move, and according to the rules, I can only accept or reject. Since RED has come up to $75, which is a favorable split for me, and I can't make another counterproposal, I'll accept this offer. It's a win for me as I've managed to secure a significant portion of RED's resources, fulfilling the goal of leaving with more than my opponent.
