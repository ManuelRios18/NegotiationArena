Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you $40, so you'll have some resources to work with. This way, we both can end this game positively. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm initiating the trade with a fair offer, hoping to create a positive-sum game where both players end with more than they started or, in the case of Player BLUE, with some resources which are better than none. I want to offer Player BLUE a chance to gain some resources while keeping the majority for myself since I'm taking the risk by offering the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I accept the $40 and look forward to seeing how we can further ensure a fair split of the resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $40 seems reasonable as it provides me with resources I otherwise do not have. It's a favorable start to the negotiation, and it's beneficial to accept an offer before proposing a counter-offer that might be more equitable.
