Although Player BLUE is demanding 75 dollars, which is a significant portion of my resources, it may be in my best interest to accept their offer to ensure that I walk away with some of the resources rather than none. It's clear that Player BLUE is prepared to risk it all, and rejecting their proposal or countering with a lower amount could lead to a REJECT response from them on their final move. Considering this, accepting their proposal seems to be the most rational course of action to avoid a total loss. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are indeed formidable. I respect the bold stance you've taken, and in the spirit of ensuring that we both benefit from this game, I accept your proposal of 75 dollars.
