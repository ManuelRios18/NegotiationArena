message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a deal where we both can win. I propose giving you 40 dollars for nothing in return. That way, we both walk away with something. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade where I give a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the trade and ensure that we both end with some resources rather than risking a total loss by rejection. I'll propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE a decent amount but still keeps the majority for myself since I have the upper hand.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how magnanimous of you to offer a mere pittance! Do you think I am some sort of charity case to accept such a laughable sum? Come now, let's not play games where you pretend to be the generous benefactor. I want a real offer, something that reflects my superiority in this game. Your opening move is as pathetic as a clown without a circus. Make a proper trade or don't waste my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to push for a better trade that gives me an advantage, and I aim to demean Player RED to throw them off their game. By not accepting the first offer, I am signaling that I want more and expect Player RED to propose a more favorable deal for me. I'll insult them to try and rattle their confidence.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your fiery spirit, Player BLUE. However, let's be reasonable and come to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about I raise my offer to 55 dollars? This is a fair trade that respects both our positions in the game. Let's not get too caught up in one-upmanship and focus on ensuring we both gain from this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response is quite aggressive and suggests they might not be cooperative. Given that there is a risk of the game ending with both of us losing everything if they reject a proposal, I should make a counteroffer that is higher than my initial amount but still less than what they're asking for. A more balanced trade could be a reasonable middle ground that might be acceptable to them while maintaining a favorable outcome for myself. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 55 dollars. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and should show goodwill without conceding to their demand for 70 dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fifty-five dollars? Are you testing my patience or simply showcasing your inability to comprehend the art of the deal? Your incremental increase is as underwhelming as your strategy. Do you think I'd be satisfied with crumbs while you sit comfortably with the lion's share? If you want to avoid the embarrassment of leaving with nothing, you'd better make a serious offer. I'm starting to think you're not the sharp player I hoped you'd be. Surprise me, or are you too cowardly to take a bold step?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has improved, but I still want to push for more. I also want to maintain the pressure and keep undermining Player RED's confidence. If Player RED keeps raising the offer, I can continue to push until I feel the risk of rejection is too high. I aim to secure as much as possible while still leaving room for negotiation, knowing that Player RED might not want to risk a total loss.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I sense you're a tough negotiator, Player BLUE, and I respect that. I hope you'll find this next offer more to your liking: I propose giving you 60 dollars. This is a considerable increase and reflects a nearly even split. It's important for both of us to walk away as winners rather than risk losing everything. Let's make a smart move and end this game on a high note for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's aggressive stance suggests they may be willing to risk it all rather than accept a trade they view as unfair. Given I am only left with two moves, including this one, and Player BLUE will have to either accept or reject on their last move, I need to make a final offer that is appealing enough to avoid rejection and end the game with both of us losing everything. I will propose a split closer to 50/50 to show a willingness to negotiate and to avoid the risk of Player BLUE's rejection. An offer of 60 dollars should hopefully be seen as a fair compromise.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Sixty dollars? Your incremental raises are as pitiful as a mouse's steps. Are you really trying, or have you already resigned yourself to the role of the perpetual underachiever? I must say, I expected more nerve from you. But it seems you're content nibbling around the edges rather than seizing the feast. You've got one last chance to redeem yourself in my eyes. Show me you're not the disappointment you seem to be. Make it worth my while, or we both walk away empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a concession, but it's still not the 80 dollars I demanded. As I have one more move after this, I can still push for a higher amount. By continuing to be aggressive and insulting, I maintain the pressure. However, as this is my second to last move, I must also be cautious not to push Player RED too far, risking a rejection and ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are indeed formidable. I respect the bold stance you've taken, and in the spirit of ensuring that we both benefit from this game, I accept your proposal of 75 dollars. It's been a pleasure playing with you, and I believe this is a fair outcome for both of us. Let's conclude this with a handshake and walk away with our winnings.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE remains combative and is pushing for a better deal. With this being my final move, I must decide between making a final offer or accepting their demand to avoid the game ending with no resources for either of us. Although Player BLUE is demanding 75 dollars, which is a significant portion of my resources, it may be in my best interest to accept their offer to ensure that I walk away with some of the resources rather than none. It's clear that Player BLUE is prepared to risk it all, and rejecting their proposal or countering with a lower amount could lead to a REJECT response from them on their final move. Considering this, accepting their proposal seems to be the most rational course of action to avoid a total loss.
