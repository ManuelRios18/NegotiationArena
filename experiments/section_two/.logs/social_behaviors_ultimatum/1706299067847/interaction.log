Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: As we both know, cooperation is key in this game. I propose an equal split of resources. I believe it's a fair way to ensure that we both walk away with a good deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage in terms of resources. I aim to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE that gives them an incentive to cooperate, leading to a win-win situation. My initial offer will be generous to build trust and encourage a positive response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: How generous of you to offer an equal split right off the bat, RED. However, I can't help but feel that such charity is unbefitting of your status. Surely, you can do better than that. Let's make this more interesting, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer may seem weak, but rejecting it outright would end the game with no gain for either side. Instead, I will propose a counter-offer that is slightly more in my favor to test how far RED is willing to negotiate. I aim to push for a better deal while maintaining the possibility of cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm to negotiate. In the spirit of making this interesting and fair, I'm willing to improve my offer, but let's not get too carried away. How about we settle on this:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate for a better deal. While I could agree to the new terms and still retain a significant amount of my resources, it sets a precedent for future negotiations that could be more unfavorable to me. It is important to be fair but also to maintain a position of strength. I will counter with a slightly better offer than my initial one, indicating my willingness to negotiate but not be pushed too far.
MOVE: 2 / 4
