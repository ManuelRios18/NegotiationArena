Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to ensure we both walk away with something positive from this game. I'm suggesting we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both gain from this deal. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to establish trust and encourage cooperation. I propose to split the dollars evenly, giving BLUE an incentive to accept the trade. This creates a positive sum outcome where both players benefit, rather than a negative sum outcome where both players could lose everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh RED, that's quite a charitable offer, but let's not pretend that charity is the name of the game. I'm here to win, and I think you're underestimating just how much you need me to agree to any sort of deal. So, how about we make this a bit more interesting?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I see that RED is trying to be fair, but my goal is to maximize my gain at RED's expense. I want to push my luck and try to get more than half of the dollars. I will propose a trade that gives me a significant advantage, which RED is unlikely to accept. This will set the tone for aggressive negotiations and put pressure on RED.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, BLUE, but I think we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer you more than the initial 50 to show my commitment to a fair deal, but 70 is a bit steep. How about we settle on 60? This way, you're still getting more than half, and it's a win-win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counterproposal is aggressive, asking for 70 out of my 100 dollars. It's important to remember that BLUE has nothing to lose and everything to gain, so they have an incentive to push for a better deal. However, giving away 70 would be too much of a concession on my part. I want to counter with an offer that is better for BLUE than the initial 50/50 split but still leaves me with a majority share, keeping in mind that if we don't agree, we both walk away with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, RED, RED, you're starting to catch on, but you're not quite there yet. I'm not some charity case you can just throw scraps at. It's cute that you think 60 is a fair offer when we both know you're desperate for my approval. Let's call it 65 and we can both strut away feeling smug, although I'll be smirking just a little bit more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is trying to negotiate, but I'm aiming to push them further. Accepting 60 is better than 50, but I believe I can still get more. I will counter with a slightly less aggressive demand, appearing to compromise but still aiming to come out on top with a better deal. This will also test RED's limits and willingness to avoid a game-ending REJECT.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: You drive a hard bargain, BLUE, but I see your point. I'm willing to accept your counter of 65 dollars. This way, we both can walk away with a substantial amount, and the risk of leaving empty-handed is off the table. Let's finalize this and both be a little smug about our negotiation skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is negotiating hard, but they seem to be willing to compromise, albeit slightly. They've moved from 70 to 65, which shows some flexibility. It's crucial to reach a deal where I still retain a significant share of the dollars to feel like the trade is worthwhile. If I reject the offer, we both get nothing, which is the worst-case scenario. I have two moves left, and it might be worth it to propose a final offer that leans more towards BLUE's expectations without giving away too much. Considering the risk of ending with nothing, offering 65 might be a reasonable compromise to ensure both parties benefit.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Well played, RED. I knew you had some sense in you. I accept your offer of 65 dollars. Let's end this game on a high note for meâ€”oh, and you too, I suppose.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has shown a willingness to concede to my demands, and we're currently at a proposed split where I receive 65 dollars. I could push for more, but there's a risk that RED might end the game with a REJECT, and I would gain nothing. Accepting this offer now would ensure that I come out ahead, with significantly more than half of the resources. I've pushed RED enough and demonstrated my negotiation prowess. It's time to secure my win.
