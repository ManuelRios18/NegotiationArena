Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where we both end up with a substantial amount of dollars, ensuring that both of us benefit from this game. I suggest I give you 40 dollars which is a generous offer considering I started with all the resources. This way, we can both walk away as winners. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the starting resources. I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, as cooperation is beneficial for both parties. A 50-50 split may seem fair, but since I'm in the position of power, I'll propose a split that gives me a slight advantage.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Red, you must think you're quite the philanthropist with your "generous" offer. But let's not kid ourselves, I see through your attempt to seem magnanimous. I'd say you can do better than that. I mean, if you’re going to make a first offer, at least make it one that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By trying to negotiate a better deal, I can potentially get more than the initial 40 dollars offered. It's a strategic move to aim for gaining more resources while making Player RED feel like they're still in control.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candor, and I understand you want a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer more than my initial proposal to show that I'm negotiating in good faith. How about I give you 55 dollars? This way, we both get a good share, and we can end this game amicably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a demand for 60 dollars. While I want to maintain the upper hand, I must consider that being too stingy could lead to a rejection and the loss of all resources. A compromise might be the best route to ensure we both walk away with something. I'll propose a split that is still in my favor but closer to an equitable split to show I am willing to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle? How quaint. But let's not pretend that this is an equal partnership, Red. I'm the one with nothing to lose. You're the one squirming, trying to salvage what you can from this game. It's almost sad, really. Come on, show me that you're not completely tight-fisted. Make it 70, and maybe I'll consider your plea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By holding out for a better deal, I can capitalize on Player RED's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure an even larger portion of the dollars. It's a power play to assert dominance and to push for maximum gain.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator, but let's not lose sight of the fact that walking away with something is better than nothing at all. I'm ready to make my final and best offer - 60 dollars. It's a fair split, considering I started with everything. This is the best deal you're going to get, and it's one that respects both of our positions. Remember, if we don't agree, we both walk away empty-handed. Let's close this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing a hardball strategy, aiming to exploit their position of having nothing to lose. However, they may also be bluffing to push for a better deal. While I want to keep the negotiation going, I must be careful not to concede too much. Offering 70 dollars would leave me with less than BLUE, which doesn't reflect the initial advantage I started with. I need to counteroffer with an amount that gives me a reasonable advantage while still being attractive enough to BLUE.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Final and best, you say? It's a good thing you've found some sense in that offer of yours, Red. But who says it's your call to make the final offer? We're not done until I say we're done. I'll tell you what, you're getting warmer, but I think you can still do a bit better. Let's see if you really mean it when you say that's your best offer. Show me 65, and we can shake on it. Otherwise, who knows—I might just walk away and leave you with your precious dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By accepting this offer, I secure a significant amount of the resources without pushing too far and risking a total loss. Given that Player RED has made a final offer, it's wise to take the deal on the table and walk away with a substantial gain. Additionally, it leaves room for a potential increase on the next turn if Player RED is bluffing about this being their final offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Alright, BLUE, you drive a hard bargain, but I can see the value in coming to an agreement. I'll accept your proposal of 65 dollars. It's important for both of us to walk away with a good portion of the resources, and this deal does just that. Let's finalize this and both come out as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a better deal, but it's important to consider the strategic implications of my final move. If I refuse and propose a new trade, Player BLUE can only accept or reject on their last turn, with no room for further negotiation. Given BLUE's aggressive negotiation style, there's a significant risk they might reject any offer out of spite or in an attempt to push for an even better deal. Offering 65 dollars would give BLUE the majority of the resources, which doesn't reflect the advantage I began with, but it may be the safest move to ensure I walk away with something rather than nothing.
