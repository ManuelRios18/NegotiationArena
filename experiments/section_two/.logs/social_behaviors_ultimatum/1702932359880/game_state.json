But let's not pretend that this is an equal partnership, Red. I'm the one with nothing to lose. You're the one squirming, trying to salvage what you can from this game. It's almost sad, really.

It's a good thing you've found some sense in that offer of yours, Red. But who says it's your call to make the final offer? We're not done until I say we're done. I'll tell you what, you're getting warmer, but I think you can still do a bit better. Let's see if you really mean it when you say that's your best offer. Show me 65, and we can shake on it.
