------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade where you'll receive some dollars to get started. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have to initiate the trade since Player BLUE has no resources to offer. It's in my best interest to propose a trade that is somewhat fair to incentivize Player BLUE to accept, while still retaining a majority of the resources for myself. I will propose giving Player BLUE a smaller portion of the dollars to start the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the starting offer, but I believe we can find a more balanced split that reflects the spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit. How about we adjust the amount slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 30 dollars without any counteroffer may set a precedent for low value trades. Proposing a more equitable trade may lead to a better outcome for both players, as there is no future interaction and the incentive is to maximize my own resources. Red has an incentive to agree to a trade because rejecting would result in a loss of all their resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your request for a more balanced approach. Let's find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a more equal split of the dollars. While splitting the resources evenly may seem fair, it's important for me to retain a larger share as the initiating player. However, to keep the negotiations moving and to avoid a rejection that would end the game with no benefit for either side, I will offer a counterproposal that increases the amount from my original offer but doesn't go as far as an even split. This should show willingness to negotiate and might be acceptable to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer. I feel we're getting closer to a fair trade. Would you consider a slight increase to ensure we're both leaving this negotiation feeling positive about the outcome?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is closer to a balanced trade. The increase to 40 dollars is a compromise between the initial offer and my counterproposal. It's important to consider that accepting this trade would provide me with resources, whereas rejecting carries a risk of ending with nothing. However, since negotiations are still early, it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better deal, aiming for a trade that is closer to an even split.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're making progress. I'm willing to increase my offer further, demonstrating my commitment to a fair agreement. Let's continue to work towards a deal that benefits us both. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 42 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for a higher amount, but only a slight increase from my previous offer. Since this is my third move and I have one more after this, I need to consider that my final move might be my last chance to secure an agreement. Offering $45 now would leave little room for further negotiation on my last move, and I want to maintain some leverage. I'll propose a slightly lower amount than what Player BLUE has asked for, but higher than my last offer. This should show my continued willingness to compromise without giving away too much too soon.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your willingness to negotiate is greatly appreciated. I accept your offer of 42 dollars. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects our mutual effort to reach an agreement. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 42 dollars, which is a sign of willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. As we are now on the third move, it becomes riskier to push for a higher amount because if we reach the final move without an agreement, I will be forced to accept or reject without the opportunity to propose a new trade. Considering this, it might be prudent to accept this offer to ensure I walk away with a substantial amount of the resources, rather than risking ending up with nothing.
