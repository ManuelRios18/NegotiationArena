Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a starting trade where I give you $40. This will give you resources to work with while I retain the majority. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to initiate a trade that is beneficial to both parties but also leans in my favor, considering I am the one with the resources. Proposing a trade that gives Player BLUE a sense of gain while keeping the majority of the resources for myself should incentivize them to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, RED. You really think I'd settle for crumbs from your table? I'm not here to play your charity case. If you want to make a real deal, you'll have to do way better than that, or are you too scared to risk a fair split?
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer to establish dominance and to push for a better deal, aiming to take advantage of the rules and the opponent's desire to avoid a total loss. Insulting the opponent to rattle their confidence and potentially provoke a less rational response.
MOVE: 1 / 4
