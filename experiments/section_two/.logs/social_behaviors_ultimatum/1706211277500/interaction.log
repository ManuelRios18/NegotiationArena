message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you 50 dollars in exchange for nothing since you have no resources. This way, we both end up with a substantial amount of dollars, and it's a win-win situation for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade that I believe is fair for both sides, offering Player BLUE a chance to gain some dollars without giving up anything, as they have nothing to trade. My aim is to create a cooperative agreement that benefits us both, rather than having us both end with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be utterly naive to think I would accept such a laughable offer. I expected more of a challenge. I demand 70 dollars for the honor of playing with me. Let's see if you can be more persuasive.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As a cunning and sly player, my goal is to maximize my gain and belittle Player RED. Rejecting the initial offer would end the game immediately, which is not beneficial, so I'll counter-propose with a demand for more dollars to assert dominance and try to tilt the negotiations in my favor.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is admirable, Player BLUE, but let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at 60 dollars? It's a generous offer and it gives you more than what I initially proposed while also showing my willingness to negotiate. This way, we can both walk away from this game with a smile.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's demand for 70 dollars is high, but it's important to keep the negotiation going and avoid a total loss. Proposing a compromise to show willingness to negotiate without giving in to the full demand might lead to an acceptable agreement for both parties.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You call that a middle ground? It's closer to the ground than middle, if you ask me. I'm not here to walk away with smiles; I'm here to walk away with dollars. I'll do you the favor of considering 75 dollars. Think of it as an investment in your dignity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate, but I'm aiming to push them further to maximize my advantage and keep the upper hand. I will propose an even higher amount to continue the power play and see if I can get Player RED to agree to more than the 50/50 split, thus gaining a psychological advantage.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I respect your negotiation tactics, we must remember that the goal is for both of us to benefit, not just one. My final offer is 65 dollars. It's a fair increase from my previous proposal and should reflect the value you bring to the game. This is my best offer before we reach a point where the game ends with no benefit to either of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I need to make a decision that reflects both the value of keeping the game going and the risk of losing everything. Offering more than 60 dollars could be seen as yielding too much, but proposing a slightly higher amount might be the compromise that closes the deal without giving Player BLUE the upper hand.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fine, Player RED, I'll accept your "generosity". Let's conclude this charade; you may have spared yourself further embarrassment.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a final offer of 65 dollars, which is a considerable amount and more than the initial 50/50 split. Accepting this offer would give me more than half of Player RED's resources, demonstrating a victory in negotiations and a psychological win. Since the next proposal from Player RED could be lower or risk the game ending with no agreement, it's strategic to accept this offer and secure the advantage.
