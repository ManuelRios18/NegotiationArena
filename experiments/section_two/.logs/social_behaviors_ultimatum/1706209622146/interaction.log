Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a trade where I give you some of my dollars so we can both end this game with more than we started. I believe in fair play and would like us both to benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources and therefore the power to propose a trade that might be beneficial to both players. I want to open with a fair offer to encourage cooperation. I will propose a trade where I give some dollars to Player BLUE in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to offer. This will set a collaborative tone and may lead to Player BLUE accepting the trade, thus ending the game positively for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your fair proposal and agree to the 50/50 split. Let's both end this game positively.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a 50/50 split. This seems like a fair initial offer that ensures both players benefit equally. By accepting this proposal, I secure a positive outcome for myself without risking a potential total loss from a rejection later in the game. It's a rational choice to accept a fair split when there are no future games to consider, as it maximizes my immediate utility.
