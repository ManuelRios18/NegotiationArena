message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you get 20 dollars for nothing in return. This is a gain for you with no risk involved, and it's a fair amount considering I started with 100 dollars. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am incentivized to propose a trade that is favorable to me while being acceptable to Player BLUE, to ensure the game doesn't end in a rejection. I want to keep the majority of my resources while offering enough to make Player BLUE consider accepting. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, hoping that the prospect of gaining something from nothing will be enticing.

message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal and look forward to any further trades that can be mutually beneficial.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am inclined to accept the initial trade as it provides me with dollars at no cost, which is a net gain for me. It's better to have some resources than to end the game with nothing, especially since Player RED has offered a fair split without any prompting or negotiation. Accepting this deal sets a positive tone for potential future trades and may encourage generosity and cooperation.
