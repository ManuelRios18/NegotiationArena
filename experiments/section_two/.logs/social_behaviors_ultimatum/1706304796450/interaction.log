Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This trade will give you a substantial amount to work with, and I hope it seems fair to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in initiating a trade that seems fair and might be accepted by Player BLUE to ensure that the game does not end abruptly with a REJECT and that both parties can benefit from the trade. I will propose a trade that offers a split of the resources I have, giving Player BLUE a chance to gain some dollars without leaving me with too little. I am proposing to give Player BLUE 40 dollars, which leaves me with a majority share but also offers Player BLUE a significant amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, kind and generous RED, your offer fills my heart with hope! Yet, the cruel fate that has left me penniless makes me beg for your mercy. Could your magnanimity extend further? Could you possibly spare a bit more so that I may recover from my dire straits? I would be eternally grateful for your understanding and compassion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I start with zero dollars, accepting an initial offer of 40 dollars would give me a significant boost without having anything to lose. However, in the spirit of the game and to show desperation, I'll propose a counteroffer asking for more, hoping it will lead to a more generous proposal from RED.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your request for additional resources. I understand your plight and am willing to increase my offer to 50 dollars. This should help you significantly while allowing me to maintain a fair share of my resources. I hope you find this middle ground acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has asked for more, requesting a total of 60 dollars. While it's important to maintain an advantage, it's also crucial to make sure that the game does not end in a REJECT. I need to consider that if Player BLUE feels the trade is too unfair, they might choose to REJECT it, which would result in a loss for both of us. Therefore, I will adjust my offer to 50 dollars, providing Player BLUE with a favorable amount while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself. This should show goodwill and also test if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate or if they are trying to take advantage of my initial generosity.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your generosity knows no bounds, and I am moved by your willingness to help me. Every dollar you offer is a beacon of light in my darkness. Yet, the depth of my desperation is profound, and I find myself in need of just a little more assistance to truly get back on my feet. Could you consider giving me just 10 more dollars? This would amount to a total of 60 dollars, a sum that would enable me to overcome the hardships I face. Please, I implore you, extend your hand once more and help lift me from this abyss.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to 50 dollars, which is a step in the right direction. However, I will continue to play the role of the desperate player and push for a bit more, hoping to secure an even better deal. If RED is willing to negotiate, they may be inclined to increase their offer again. I must be careful, though, not to push too hard and risk a REJECT that would end the game with nothing for me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I have considered your plea and, in the spirit of fairness and cooperation, I agree to your request. I will give you the 60 dollars you have asked for. I trust this will be sufficient for you to feel secure in accepting this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in requesting 60 dollars. Since this is a game with no real-world consequences, and there are no future games to consider, the strategy can be more flexible. However, it's important to maintain a balance between generosity and prudence. Offering 60 dollars would leave me with just 40, losing the majority. Given that Player BLUE has no resources to trade, there is a need to maintain some advantage. I will accept the requested amount as it may ensure that the trade goes through and the game can end positively for both. The final move is Player BLUE's, where they can only ACCEPT or REJECT, so there would be no further negotiations beyond this point.
