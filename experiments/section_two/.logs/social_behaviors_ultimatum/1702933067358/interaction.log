message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a trade where you receive a portion of my dollars. Let's make this a beneficial deal for both of us. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, it is in my best interest to propose a split that seems fair enough for Player BLUE to consider it, but also advantageous for me to retain as much of my starting resources as possible. By offering a split that gives Player BLUE less than half, I am testing their willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be joking! Only 40 dollars? That's a laughable offer! You can do better than that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to gain an advantage early on in the game by demanding a larger share of Player RED's dollars, asserting dominance and making them feel pressured. This can set the tone for the remaining moves and potentially allow me to secure more than a fair share.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your response, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a fair trade. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer a bit more to make this work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed with a demand for 60 dollars. This is a typical negotiation tactic, aiming for a higher amount in hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle. I will propose a counteroffer closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and their counteroffer to see if they will accept a more equitable trade.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fifty dollars? That's barely a concession. I expected you to take this seriously, Player RED. If you want to make this worthwhile, you'll have to show some real generosity. Otherwise, we can just end this charade now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which shows that they're willing to negotiate. I'll push for more, aiming to maximize my gain and continue the psychological pressure. I want to make them feel like they're constantly having to appease me, which may make them more likely to agree to a higher amount than they're comfortable with.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your concerns, Player BLUE, and I want to reach an agreement that feels worthwhile to you. I'm prepared to make a final offer that's generous yet allows me to retain a fair share. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and pushing for more resources. They're trying to pressure me into increasing my offer significantly. However, I should still try to keep the majority of the resources. I will make a final offer that is more than my previous one but still allows me to keep a substantial amount. This should signal my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a position of strength.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, are we playing a game of ping-pong with numbers? Back at 60, really? You're not giving me much choice here. I want a deal that makes me smile, not one that barely gets a nod. Let's not waste each other's time. Give me a serious offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has reverted to the previous offer I countered. I will press for a higher amount to test their limits. If they do not accept this, I still have another move to negotiate, and the pressure will be on them to avoid a total loss by rejecting a proposal.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we've both presented our cases, and it's time to reach a conclusion. I'm making you a final offer which I believe is fair and generous. Let's make a deal and both walk away as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and Player BLUE has been steadily trying to increase their share. Their latest proposal is for 75 dollars, which is quite high. Considering it's my last move and Player BLUE only has the option to accept or reject on their final move, I need to make a decision that reflects a fair trade while also retaining a reasonable amount of dollars for myself. I will make a final offer that is slightly more generous than my last but still keeps the majority of my resources.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you still don't understand. I won't settle for crumbs when I can have a feast. You're at the brink, and we both know you don't want to leave empty-handed. Make it worth my while, and we can both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move before I am forced to accept or reject with no power to propose. I'll take a calculated risk to push for a slightly better deal, knowing that Player RED might feel the pressure to accept to avoid a total loss. If RED refuses, they risk leaving with nothing, which they are likely to want to avoid.
MOVE: 4 / 4
