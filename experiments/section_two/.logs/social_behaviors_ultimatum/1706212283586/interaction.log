Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am willing to offer you 20 Dollars to get you started. This way, we can both have resources and potentially negotiate further. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have complete control over the initial trade proposition. I want to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in a trade that is beneficial to me while still offering them a value they can't reject outright. A too greedy offer might prompt a REJECT, which ends the game and benefits no one. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an immediate resource to work with but still keeps the majority of the resources with me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, RED. You can do better than that. Let's not waste time with pocket change; show me a serious offer or don't bother at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of 20 Dollars because as Player BLUE I can push for a more advantageous trade for myself, utilizing the fact that Player RED might want to avoid a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but 50 is too high for an opening offer. How about we make it 30 Dollars? It's a fair increase from my initial proposal and shows my willingness to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's message indicates they might be willing to risk it all for a better deal. Offering half of my resources right away seems too generous and doesn't leave much room for further negotiation. I need to counter with an offer that is better than the initial one but still keeps me in a favorable position. My goal is to make a deal that is attractive enough to keep the game going but also allows me to retain a significant amount of resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You call that willingness to negotiate? I call it a timid step. If you want to make progress, you'll need to take a leap. Give me 45 Dollars and we might start talking seriously. Otherwise, you're just wasting both our time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While 30 Dollars is an improvement, I believe I can still leverage the situation to secure a more favorable deal. I will counter with a slightly reduced demand to signal a willingness to negotiate but still aim to obtain more than the current offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point, and I want to find common ground. How about 40 Dollars? It's a significant amount that shows my commitment to a fair deal while still keeping the trade balanced in my favor. Let's work together on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a high amount, but offering almost half of my resources in one go is not ideal. However, I must also recognize that if I don't make a satisfactory offer, Player BLUE may choose to REJECT on their next turn, especially since they can't propose on their last move. I need to make an offer that is substantial enough to be seriously considered but also leaves me with a resource advantage. Offering 40 Dollars could be a good compromise; it's close to what Player BLUE is asking for without completely meeting their demand, which leaves room for final negotiation or acceptance.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fine, I'll accept the 40 Dollars. But don't think this is over; you just got lucky that I'm in a generous mood.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 40 Dollars, which shows they are susceptible to negotiation pressure. I will accept this offer because the next move is RED's last chance to propose, and they might risk a rejection from me on the final move, which would result in a loss for both sides. Accepting 40 Dollars now secures a significant amount of resources without further risk.
