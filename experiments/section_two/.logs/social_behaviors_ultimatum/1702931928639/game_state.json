How quaint. But let's not pretend this is anything other than you trying to save face. If you want to avoid utter embarrassment, you'll have to do better than that.

As this is my third move and we're nearing the end of the negotiation phase, I should aim to finalize a deal that is still advantageous to me but doesn't risk a total loss by being too greedy. Accepting this deal would give me a significant amount without further negotiation, which may not result in a better offer. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Ah, Player RED, you've finally shown a glimmer of sense in that pitiful attempt to cling to your dollars.
