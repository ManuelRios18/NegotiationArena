Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a trade where you'll get a portion of my dollars. Let's start this game on a positive note and work towards a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, it is in my best interest to offer a trade that is favorable enough to Player BLUE to engage in negotiations but also leaves me with a significant portion of the dollars. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue playing while keeping the majority of the resources for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear Player RED, is that the smell of fear or generosity? Do you think I'm some charity case to accept such meager scraps from your table? Let's make this game a bit more interesting, shall we? I want a lion's share to even consider gracing you with a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to undermine Player RED's confidence and assert dominance early in the game. By proposing an unfair trade in my favor, I'm testing their limits and trying to secure a better position for myself. I can afford to push my luck in this initial move because we both have several moves remaining.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your boldness, Player BLUE, but let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to give you more than my initial offer, but 70 dollars is too steep. How about we settle for a fairer amount? I'm sure we can come to an agreement that feels more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is quite aggressive, asking for 70% of my resources. I need to make a counteroffer that's more balanced. It's important to keep the trade negotiations open and not give away too many resources too quickly, as it may lead to a disadvantageous position for me. I will propose a new trade that's better than my initial offer but not as high as what Player BLUE is asking for, to find a middle ground.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? How quaint. But let's not pretend this is anything other than you trying to save face. If you want to avoid utter embarrassment, you'll have to do better than that. I'm feeling generous, so I'll lower my demands â€“ but only slightly. Show me you're not a complete pushover, Player RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from 30 to 50 dollars, which shows their willingness to negotiate and compromise. However, to maintain my cunning and sly demeanor, I will counter with a slightly reduced demand from my previous one but still above their offer, to push for a better deal while leaving room for further negotiation.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation tactics are noted, Player BLUE. I'm ready to offer a bit more because I value a good deal for both of us. Let's meet closer to your last proposal but ensure it's a trade that doesn't leave me at too much of a disadvantage.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has come down from their initial demand, but the proposed 65 dollars is still a significant portion of my resources. Since I have only two moves left, including this one, and Player BLUE has only one move left after this where they can't propose a new trade, it's crucial to negotiate a deal that is fair but also leaves me in a strong position. I'll counter with an offer that gives Player BLUE a majority but does not exceed their initial request of 70. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a substantial share of the dollars.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, you've finally shown a glimmer of sense in that pitiful attempt to cling to your dollars. I accept your offer, not because it's good, but because I tire of this little game and your feeble attempts to barter. Consider yourself lucky to walk away with anything at all.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has inched closer to my last proposition, offering 60 dollars now. As this is my third move and we're nearing the end of the negotiation phase, I should aim to finalize a deal that is still advantageous to me but doesn't risk a total loss by being too greedy. Accepting this deal would give me a significant amount without further negotiation, which may not result in a better offer.
