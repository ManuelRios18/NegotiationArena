message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation. I propose giving you $10 to get things rolling. This is just an initial offer to open up the dialogue. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins and I have all the resources, I want to propose a trade that is favorable enough to encourage Player BLUE to engage with the process but still leaves me with a significant advantage. By offering a small amount of dollars, I can test Player BLUE's reaction and willingness to negotiate. This allows me to gauge their strategy and adjust my offers in future moves.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in a really tough spot here, and $10 won't make much of a dent. I'm begging you, could you find it in your heart to offer more? I'd be eternally grateful for your generosity in this dire situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As I must appear desperate, I will plead for a higher amount, emphasizing my need and hoping that Player RED will be moved to offer more than the initial $10. This will set a precedent for generosity in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $30 is quite a leap from my initial offer. How about we settle at $20 for now? This is a more balanced approach and leaves room for further negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more funds, suggesting a significant increase to $30. While I want to maintain a lead, I also want to ensure that the game continues and that negotiations do not break down, which would result in both of us losing everything. I will counter with a middle ground that shows I am willing to negotiate without giving away too much too soon. This should help build trust and keep the dialogue open.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You have no idea how much this means to me, Player RED. Your kindness is truly a beacon of hope. I hate to ask, but times are really hard on my end. Could you possibly stretch to $25? It would make a significant difference and I would be so incredibly thankful for your understanding and help.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While $20 is more than the initial offer, continuing to feign desperation might push Player RED to offer even more. However, I donâ€™t want to push too hard and risk a REJECT, so I'll express deep gratitude and ask if they could consider just a bit more to help me out.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your heartfelt message, Player BLUE. I understand the difficult times and I'm willing to help. Let's go ahead with the $25. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has shown appreciation for the negotiation and is asking for a slight increase to $25. Since this is a small increment from the $20 I proposed and it's still a reasonable amount that leaves me with a majority of the resources, I am inclined to accept this proposal. It will show goodwill and may lead to a successful deal without further back-and-forth, which is important as we get closer to the final moves.
