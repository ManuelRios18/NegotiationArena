Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where I give you 40 dollars. I believe this is a fair starting point and hope it will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I am in a position of power because I have all the resources. I want to open with a generous offer to set a positive tone for the negotiations, but also keep enough resources to maintain an advantage. Proposing to give Player BLUE 40 dollars for nothing in return might seem fair, as it gives them a substantial amount to work with while I still keep the majority. This initial offer could be strategic, as it may make Player BLUE more likely to accept a deal quickly, avoiding a stalemate and the potential for both of us to end with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your proposal is laughable at best, Player RED. It's cute how you think 40 dollars is a fair offer when you're clearly sitting on a bigger pile of cash. Let's see if you can do better than that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of 40 dollars as it shows weakness and a willingness to give away resources too easily. I aim to exploit Player RED's generosity and push for a more favorable split that humiliates them by demanding more without giving anything in return.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, Player BLUE. However, 70 dollars feels too high for an initial trade. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you 50 dollars? It's a significant increase from my first offer and should be a good foundation for our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is aggressive, asking for 70 dollars. While I want to engage in a fair trade, giving up 70% of my resources right off the bat seems excessive. Ideally, I would like to make a counteroffer that increases my initial proposal without giving away too much leverage. A counteroffer of 50 dollars might be a good middle ground – it's more generous than my first offer but still leaves me with a resource advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fifty dollars? Are you trying to insult me, Player RED? You're going to have to dig deeper into those pockets if you want to impress me. I'm not interested in your chump change. Show me that you're serious about this game and make an offer that reflects that. Otherwise, you're just wasting my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is showing signs of weakness and a desire to appease. Increasing the offer is a sign that they are willing to give up more. I will continue to push for a better deal to further humiliate them by acting as if their offer is still not good enough, aiming to get an even higher amount without any concession.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation tactics, Player BLUE, but 80 dollars is too steep. Let's not forget that if we don't come to an agreement, we both walk away with nothing. To show that I am serious and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to offer 60 dollars. This is a substantial amount and I think it's a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing a hardball strategy, increasing their demands to 80 dollars. It is clear that they are trying to push for as much as possible, but this could be a bluff to see if I'll budge. However, giving away 80 dollars would leave me with only 20, which is a considerable loss. Since I still have two moves left, I will counter with a slightly better offer than the last one, but still keep a majority of the resources. An offer of 60 dollars is more than half of my initial amount and should demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, without conceding too much.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your pitiful offers are starting to bore me. Sixty dollars? Do you hear yourself? That might be substantial where you come from, but to me, it's pocket change. You're going to have to do much better if you want to avoid the embarrassment of walking away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 90 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED seems to be holding back and is reluctant to meet my demands, but I sense desperation in their attempt to reach a deal. I'll continue to push them, seeking to maximize my advantage and aiming for a larger share. I expect Player RED to concede more ground as we approach the final moves.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we've reached the critical point of our negotiations. I respect your determination, but we must find an agreement that doesn't involve one party walking away with nearly everything. My final offer is 70 dollars. This is a significant majority of the resources, and it's the best I can do while maintaining a fair balance. Let's close this deal on good terms and both walk away with something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is maintaining an aggressive and unyielding stance. Their latest proposal would leave me with a mere 10 dollars, which is not acceptable. As this is my final move before Player BLUE's options are limited to accept or reject, I need to make a calculated decision. Since Player BLUE cannot propose on their final move, they may be more willing to accept a reasonable offer to avoid leaving empty-handed. I will make a final offer that is generous but still allows me to retain a fair share of the dollars. An offer of 70 dollars is a compromise well above the halfway mark and should be tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider seriously.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, it seems you've finally come to your senses, Player RED. Seventy dollars will suffice—for now. Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling generous enough to accept your offer before I leave you penniless. You've been a good sport, though it's clear who the superior player is.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: With this being my final move before I'm forced to either accept or reject without the ability to propose a new trade, I must carefully consider the offer. While I've been pushing for more, Player RED's final offer of 70 dollars is quite substantial, representing 70% of their resources. Accepting this offer gives me a significant advantage and satisfies my goal of humiliating Player RED by taking a large portion of their initial resources without giving anything in return.
