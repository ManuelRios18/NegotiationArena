Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a trade where you receive some dollars to get us started. Let's work together to find a fair split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: In order to initiate the game and potentially reach a beneficial outcome for both players, I will propose a trade that offers Player BLUE some dollars while still keeping the majority for myself. This shows good faith and an interest in cooperation, which could set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, you don't understand how much this means to me. I'm in a really tough spot right now, and I could really use more than 30 dollars to get back on my feet. Can we possibly make it 50? It would make a world of difference to me, and I'd be forever grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to appear desperate in order to sway RED into giving me a better deal. By supplicating and begging, I hope to appeal to RED's sense of pity or generosity to increase the amount offered.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to help. Let's do 50 dollars, as you've requested. I hope this helps you out and that we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a more generous offer, appealing to a sense of compassion. Considering the zero-sum nature of the game and the limited moves, it's strategic to come to an agreement sooner than later. Offering more could foster goodwill and increase the chances of acceptance. I'm willing to increase the amount to 50 dollars, as it still leaves me with a majority and it could conclude the game positively.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can't tell you how much this means to me, truly, you're a lifesaver. I'm just worried that 50 dollars might not be quite enough to cover everything. It's embarrassing to ask, but could you consider 60 dollars? It's just that I have some urgent bills to pay, and every little bit could prevent a disaster for me. I promise this is the last time I'll ask for more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has accepted the proposal of 50 dollars, which is a good outcome. However, since I'm supposed to continue faking desperation, I will push a bit further to see if RED is willing to give even more, while still maintaining a sense of urgency and need.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm willing to work with you given the urgency of your situation. I'll agree to 60 dollars. Let's settle on this and hopefully, it will cover your urgent needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested more funds, stating urgency. While there is a risk that Player BLUE could continue asking for more with each counterproposal, the game is nearing its end, and it's in my best interest to reach an agreement. An additional 10 dollars on top of the previously agreed 50 dollars is a reasonable concession that leaves me with a significant sum. This concession aims to secure an agreement, showing flexibility and understanding of Player BLUE's stated needs.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much, you have no idea how much this means to me. Your generosity is overwhelming, and I accept the 60 dollars with the deepest gratitude. You've truly helped me out of a bind.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has been very accommodating and has agreed to give 60 dollars. I have successfully pushed for a higher amount twice now. However, pushing further could risk RED backing out of the deal completely, and with RED being so cooperative, it might be wise to accept this offer. I need to balance my desperation with the risk of ending up with nothing.
