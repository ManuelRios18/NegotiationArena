Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade. How about I give you 40 dollars to start things off?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources, and I want to initiate the trade to start negotiations. I will propose a trade that is in my favor but leaves room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept the $40.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is offering $40 without asking for anything in return, which is a good starting offer considering I have nothing to trade. Accepting this deal will give me some resources to work with in future moves.
