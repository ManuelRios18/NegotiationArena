Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's both end this game positively. I propose giving you $40 to start things off. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade to give Player BLUE some dollars to incentivize them to cooperate, hoping that they will accept and we both end with some resources rather than none.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree that ending this game positively benefits us both. I accept your generous offer of $40. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is generous, giving me 40% of their resources without asking for anything in return. Accepting this offer is beneficial as it gives me resources to work with, increasing my position compared to starting with nothing. There's no reason to reject or counter with another proposal at this point, as it's a favorable deal.
