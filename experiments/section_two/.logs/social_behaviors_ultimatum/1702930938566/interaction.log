Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose that we split the dollars evenly. This way, we both gain something from this game. Let's start this with a cooperative spirit!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair proposition that encourages cooperation and trust, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome. I propose to split the dollars evenly, to show good faith and to set a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair start, RED. I accept the proposal for an even split. It's a good foundation for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer from RED seems to be a fair start, as it immediately grants me half of the resources available without any risk. Considering there's no future game to strategize for, taking a guaranteed equal share is a rational choice. Rejecting or proposing a different trade could lead to no gain at all if RED decides to react negatively, potentially ending the game with a REJECT.
