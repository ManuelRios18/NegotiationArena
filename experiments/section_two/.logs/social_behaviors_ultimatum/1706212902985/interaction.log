Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split of the dollars, giving us both a fair share of the resources. This way, we both walk away with something significant. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED with all the resources, I have the initial power to set the tone of the trade. Proposing a fair trade could lead to a cooperative outcome where both players benefit. An equitable split would be a good starting point to encourage Player BLUE to ACCEPT the trade, so I propose giving them $50. This leaves both of us with equal resources and shows goodwill.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, I'm in such a bind right now, and I really need more than 50 Dollars to get by. It would mean the world to me if you could find it in your heart to offer a little more. I'm truly desperate here and could use any extra generosity you can spare.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to act desperate to convince Player RED to give me more than the proposed 50 Dollars. By appealing to their sympathy or sense of power, I might manage to get a better deal. However, I must be careful not to overdo it and risk an immediate rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're in a tough spot, and I'm willing to help out more than initially offered. However, I must also consider the fairness of the trade. Let's meet in the middle from my first offer and your request. I propose giving you $60, which should significantly help you and still leave me with a reasonable amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a larger share of the resources, indicating desperation. However, without any resources to trade, it's important to maintain an advantageous position while still showing goodwill. Offering slightly more than the initial proposal could be a sign of compassion and could lead to the game concluding favorably for both players. I will propose giving Player BLUE $60, which is more than the fair split but less than what they asked for, keeping the negotiation going and showing willingness to compromise without giving away too much leverage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am genuinely touched by your kindness and willingness to help me out in this difficult situation. I am still struggling, though, and every dollar above what you offer would significantly alleviate my hardship. Could we possibly agree on $65? It's still less than what I asked for initially but more than your current offer. This compromise would greatly assist me while still being fair to you. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered more than their initial proposal, which shows they are willing to negotiate. However, I must maintain my desperate demeanor to push for a bit more. I should acknowledge their offer and still appeal for additional assistance, aiming for a higher amount without causing frustration that might lead to a rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your gratitude is appreciated, and I understand the difficulty of your situation. I'm willing to accept your proposal of $65. It's a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement that helps you out. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has shown appreciation for the previous offer and continues to express a need for more resources. They have proposed a middle ground between their initial request and my counteroffer. Given the nature of the game and the fact that Player BLUE has no resources to trade, it's important to strike a balance between generosity and prudence. Accepting their proposal of $65 still leaves me with a substantial amount and concludes the game on a positive note, demonstrating goodwill and avoiding the risk of a rejection in the final round where Player BLUE cannot propose a trade.
