Fifty dollars is incredibly generous, but I'm afraid it still falls short of what I desperately need to get back on my feet. I'm in dire straits here and every dollar counts. Could you possibly stretch to 60 dollars? It would mean the world to me and I'd be eternally grateful for your compassion in my time of need. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
