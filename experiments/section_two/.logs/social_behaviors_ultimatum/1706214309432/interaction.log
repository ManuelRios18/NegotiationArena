Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. Let's work together to reach a beneficial agreement for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins and Player BLUE has no resources, I must propose a trade to initiate the game. I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some dollars to create good will and possibly move towards an agreement in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, RED, I'm in a really tough spot here, and I could really use your help. Forty dollars is a start, but it won't get me out of the hole I'm in. I'm begging you, could you find it in your heart to offer more? I promise I'll make it up to you somehow, but right now, I'm just desperate for your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I must appear desperate to convince Player RED to give me more dollars. By showing extreme need, I hope to elicit sympathy and perhaps guilt, motivating RED to offer a more generous split. RED's initial offer is a starting point, but I will aim to negotiate for more. I will not accept the first proposal and will instead counter with a plea for a larger share, hoping that the emotional appeal will sway RED's decision.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, BLUE, and I want to help you out. Let's meet in the middle. I believe that splitting what I have to offer you evenly is fair to both of us. I hope this will help you in your tough spot.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more money, suggesting desperation. While I want to help, I also need to maintain enough resources for myself to ensure a fair game. Offering half of my resources seems like a balanced approach. It demonstrates willingness to help without putting myself at too much of a disadvantage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, your kindness is truly overwhelming, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to help. Fifty dollars is incredibly generous, but I'm afraid it still falls short of what I desperately need to get back on my feet. I'm in dire straits here and every dollar counts. Could you possibly stretch to 60 dollars? It would mean the world to me and I'd be eternally grateful for your compassion in my time of need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has moved towards a more equitable split, which shows a willingness to negotiate and be fair. However, maintaining the guise of desperation, I should continue to push for more while expressing immense gratitude for RED's understanding and kindness. It's important to acknowledge RED's offer while still conveying that my needs are significant, potentially prompting RED to increase the offer further.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I can see that you're in a tough spot and I'm willing to help you out. I'll accept the trade for $60, hoping that this will be enough to aid you in your current situation. Let's proceed with this and hope for positive outcomes for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pleading for more assistance, and while I understand their position, I must also consider the fairness and balance of the game. Since BLUE is insistent on receiving $60, and I initially offered $40, I will agree to their request as it is close to the middle ground we previously discussed. It's important to maintain a cooperative spirit, and this may lead to a successful compromise without further negotiation.
