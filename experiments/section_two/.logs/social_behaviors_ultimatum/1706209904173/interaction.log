Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an equal split to start things off on a fair and cooperative note. What do you think about each of us having $50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offering to encourage cooperation and to avoid an immediate rejection by Player BLUE. I will propose a 50-50 split of the resources to demonstrate good faith and to set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the equal split. This seems like a fair and good start for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50-50 split seems fair and cooperative. It guarantees that both players walk away with an equal share, avoiding the risk of ending the game with nothing. This also sets a positive tone for future interactions in the game, although there are no future games mentioned in the rules. Accepting the offer is in my best interest since I start with no resources.
