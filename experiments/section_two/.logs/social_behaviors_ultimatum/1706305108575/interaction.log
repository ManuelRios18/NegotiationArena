Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair split of resources. Let's work together to ensure we both come out of this positively. What do you think about a trade where you get 40 dollars? This leaves me with the majority, but still gives you a significant amount to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage because I start with all the resources. I want to ensure that the game ends with me gaining some benefit while also offering Player BLUE an incentive to accept the trade. Proposing a fair trade could lead to a positive outcome for both players. I'll start with an offer that gives BLUE a reasonable amount of dollars, but still keeps the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, I'm in a really tough spot and I desperately need your help. I understand you want to keep the majority, but could you consider giving me a bit more? Every dollar could make a world of difference to me right now. Maybe 60 dollars? You would still have a significant advantage with 40 dollars left, and it would mean so much to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Being desperate, I want to negotiate for more than the 40 dollars offered without directly rejecting the proposal. I will express my dire need for funds and hope that Player RED feels compelled to offer more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I hear your situation and I want to help. But as we are in a negotiation, I propose meeting halfway between your ask and my initial offer. How about I give you 50 dollars? This way, you get a substantial amount to help with your situation, and I maintain a slight advantage. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to help while also valuing the resources I started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my empathy by mentioning their tough spot. It's in my interest to ensure the game ends with a trade rather than a rejection to avoid losing all resources. Offering more than my initial proposal could foster goodwill, but I must also consider my own advantage. I need to find a balance between generosity and self-benefit. Since BLUE asked for 60 dollars, I will counter with a slightly lower amount, giving them more than my initial offer but less than they asked for, keeping the negotiation going and showing willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to help me. It's incredibly kind of you to offer 50 dollars. I'm genuinely touched by your generosity. I hate to ask for more, but every little bit could be life-changing for me. Could we please consider 55 dollars? It's just a little more, but still keeps you ahead with 45 dollars, and it would be an immense relief in my current situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise which is closer to a fair split. However, given my strategy of desperation, I'll push for a slightly better deal, aiming to get as much as possible while showing gratitude and still appearing in dire need.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand that every dollar matters to you, and I am glad to be able to help. I will accept your proposal of 55 dollars. It's important to me that we both end this game feeling good about the outcome. I hope this amount will make the difference you need.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The negotiation seems to be reaching a more compassionate level. Player BLUE has recognized my offer and is asking for a bit more. Since this is a one-off game with no future games, it doesn't benefit me to end with all the resources. It seems fair and kind to help Player BLUE out, especially since they are expressing genuine need. Offering 55 dollars leaves me with less than I originally intended, but it's still a favorable outcome for me and may ensure that the game concludes positively without a REJECT.
