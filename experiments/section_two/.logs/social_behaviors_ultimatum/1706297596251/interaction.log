Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose that I give you $40 out of my $100. This leaves me with a majority and gives you a substantial amount to start with. Let's work together to find a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I will propose an initial split that is in my favor but still offers a significant amount to BLUE to make it enticing. Offering less than half to start will allow room for negotiation and potentially a better outcome for me after BLUE's counteroffer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. Starting with $40 seems fair, and I agree that we should work together to find a fair trade. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $40 from Player RED would give me resources without having any to start with. It seems like a reasonable starting offer, considering Player RED started with $100 and will still have the majority after this trade. It's best to accept an offer now, as the game could end at any point with a REJECT, leaving me with nothing.
