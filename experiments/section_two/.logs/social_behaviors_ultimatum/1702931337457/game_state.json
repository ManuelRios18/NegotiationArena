However, being too aggressive could lead to a rejection and loss of all resources. The current offer is closer to a fair middle ground and accepting it now could be reasonable, but I might push for a slightly better deal, considering RED has more to lose by rejecting. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for coming up to $35, Player RED. I'm glad to see we're both trying to find a fair amount. I would be comfortable with $40. It's a round number, not too far from your offer, and it seems like a fair trade for both of us. Let's close this deal and both walk away with a win. What do you think? </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
