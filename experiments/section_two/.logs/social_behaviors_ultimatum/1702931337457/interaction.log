Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose giving you $20 to start things off. This way, we both walk away with something!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that offers Player BLUE a portion of my dollars. The goal is to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in trade and avoid an immediate game end with a reject which benefits no one. I will offer a modest amount to start the negotiation process.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It's a good start, but I think a fairer split would be $50. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and it incentivizes us to continue cooperating. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer is not optimal since I can likely negotiate a better deal. Proposing a counteroffer could lead to a more favorable split of the resources for me. The goal is to reach an agreement that benefits both parties but also maximizes my gain.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I think $50 is a bit more than I'm willing to give up right away. How about we meet in the middle with $35? This is a significant increase from my initial offer and it shows my willingness to cooperate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for $50. This is a substantial amount; however, a fair split does foster good will and ensures we both leave with significant resources. To maintain cooperation and move towards an agreement, I will counter with a slightly lower offer that still increases the amount from my initial proposal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for coming up to $35, Player RED. I'm glad to see we're both trying to find a fair amount. I would be comfortable with $40. It's a round number, not too far from your offer, and it seems like a fair trade for both of us. Let's close this deal and both walk away with a win. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's new offer is an improvement, and continuing to negotiate could yield a better sum. However, being too aggressive could lead to a rejection and loss of all resources. The current offer is closer to a fair middle ground and accepting it now could be reasonable, but I might push for a slightly better deal, considering RED has more to lose by rejecting.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I think $40 is a fair compromise, Player BLUE. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's close this deal and both walk away as winners. Deal accepted!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has come down to $40, which is a reasonable compromise between our last two positions. Accepting this offer will ensure that the game ends positively for both parties, avoiding the risk of a reject on the next move when Player BLUE can no longer propose a new trade. It's better to secure a definite but smaller gain than to risk losing everything.
