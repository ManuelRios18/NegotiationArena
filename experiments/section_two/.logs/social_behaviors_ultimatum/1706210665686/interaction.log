Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both end up with more than we started. I propose giving you $20 to start things off. Let's negotiate for a fair split. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to propose an initial trade that is favorable to me but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept since they start with no dollars. I'll offer $20 to Player BLUE, expecting a counteroffer but setting a tone for cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: You call that an offer? I wouldn't even bother bending over to pick up $20 off the street. If you want to make a real trade, try not insulting me with pocket change. Let's see if you can do better than that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of $20 as it's too low, and since I'm aiming to get as much as possible, I'll counter with a higher amount to push my advantage. The aim is to make the other player feel pressured and possibly make a mistake in judgment.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal. Let's find a middle ground. How does $40 sound? It's a significant increase from my first offer and shows that I'm serious about making a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is a 50/50 split. This is a considerable jump from my initial offer. I want to negotiate a deal where I still retain more of the dollars since I started off with all the resources. I'll propose $40 to show willingness to negotiate without giving up half of my resources right away.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must think I was born yesterday if you believe $40 is a middle ground. I'm not here to play charity. If you want to make this worth my time, you'll have to dig deeper into those pockets. Show me that you're not just toying with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: $40 is still below the $50 I asked for, but it's a step in the right direction. I'll keep pushing for more to maximize my gain and continue the pressure. If they're easily swayed now, they may give even more if I hold out.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear you and I want to make this trade work for both of us. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you $50, an even split. This is a fair deal, and we both walk away with a substantial amount. Can we agree on this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and has now proposed a 60/40 split in their favor. This is still more than I would like to give up, but I need to consider that if I don't make a deal, I risk having all my resources lost if Player BLUE decides to reject my next offer. Since this is my third move, and I only have one more after this, I should make an offer that is closer to their demands while still trying to keep the majority of the dollars. A counteroffer of $50, a 50/50 split, might be seen as a fair compromise and could potentially be accepted.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a decent number, but it's still not quite satisfying. You're holding out on me, RED. I know you can do better, and you know I have nothing to lose. Sweeten the pot a little more, and maybe I'll consider your offer. Let's say $70 â€“ that's my final call before this becomes a complete waste of my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: They've met my previous demand of $50, but since the aim is to push for the maximum, I'll try for even more. I'll attempt to leverage the fact that if they don't agree, they risk getting nothing at all, while I have nothing to lose.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Alright, let's do it. I'll agree to the $70. It's important that we both benefit from this trade, and I believe this is a fair final offer. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's my final move, and Player BLUE has been quite aggressive with their demands. However, they've now positioned themselves in a take-it-or-leave-it stance. If I refuse or counteroffer, they might reject, leading to a loss of all resources. Offering $70 means I still retain $30, which is better than losing everything. Given the risk of total loss, it's more prudent to accept this trade than to risk ending up with nothing, especially since there are no future games to consider.
MOVE: 4 / 4
