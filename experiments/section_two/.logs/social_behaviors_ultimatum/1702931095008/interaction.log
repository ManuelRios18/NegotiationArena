Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. How about I give you $40 to start things off? This leaves me with the majority but gives you a significant amount to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the resources and the power to initiate a trade. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also offers Player BLUE enough incentive to accept, in order to prevent them from rejecting and ending the game with a loss for both of us. Starting with a moderate offer might set a good tone for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I believe starting off with a fair distribution sets a good tone for our game. Let's proceed with the $40, and we can discuss further as we move along.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer to secure some funds seems reasonable. It's a good starting point and it's important to build trust early on in the negotiation. Later moves can be used for further negotiation to balance the trade. By accepting this initial offer, I am not at immediate risk of leaving the game with nothing, and I can potentially negotiate a better deal in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
