However, this is my third move and my second to last chance to negotiate for more funds. I should continue to express desperation while also signaling that I might be willing to settle soon to encourage Player RED to make their best offer on the next move. I'll propose a slight increase, showing some flexibility but still aiming for a better deal. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Your kindness is truly overwhelming, Player RED, and I am deeply moved by your willingness to assist me in these trying times. I am almost tempted to accept your generous offer of 35 dollars, but I must admit that with just a bit more, I could truly engage in this game wholeheartedly. If you could stretch to 38 dollars, I feel we could both engage in a truly electrifying experience. It's just a small increase, but it would mean the world to me. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
