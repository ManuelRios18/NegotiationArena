message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game interesting! I propose giving you 20 dollars to get things started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first move. I will propose a trade that provides Player BLUE with an initial amount of dollars to engage in the game, establishing goodwill and setting the stage for further negotiation. I propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars in exchange for nothing to make the game more interesting and to potentially induce reciprocity.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, Player RED, I am in dire need of more than just 20 dollars to make any significant moves. This game means the world to me, and I would be eternally grateful if you could find it within your heart to offer more. Could you possibly consider giving me 50 dollars? I assure you, it will make the game far more challenging and interesting for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although 20 dollars is a decent starting offer, I must appear desperate to tilt the negotiation in my favor. By pleading and showing urgency, I might convince Player RED to offer a better deal, especially since they have nothing to lose at this point. I will reject the initial offer and propose a new trade, aiming for a higher amount.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for more to work with, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you 30 dollars to start? This should be enough to make things interesting without giving away too much of my leverage early on.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has asked for more than double what I initially offered. While I want to engage in the game and make it interesting, giving away half of my resources right off the bat might not be the best strategic move. I need to keep enough dollars to maintain leverage in future negotiations. However, I'm inclined to offer more than the initial 20 dollars to show my willingness to negotiate and to keep the game moving forward. I'll counter with a 30-dollar offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm truly thankful for your understanding and generosity, Player RED. But I must confess, 30 dollars still puts me in a very tight spot. The situation I'm in is really critical, and I'm begging you to consider just how much this means to me. If you could extend your offer to 40 dollars, I would be in a much more viable position to make the game worthwhile for both of us. Please, I implore you to think about it; this could be our path to an exhilarating game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a better offer, but I must maintain my desperate persona to push for even more. It's only the second move, and thereâ€™s room for Player RED to give a little more without jeopardizing their position too much. I'll acknowledge the offer and continue to plead for a higher amount, aiming for an even better trade that can still seem reasonable to Player RED.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can see that you're in a tough spot, Player BLUE, and I want to help you out. Let's split the difference: I'll give you 35 dollars. This is a substantial amount that should enable you to make meaningful moves, and it also keeps the game balanced. I hope you'll find this offer fair and conducive to an exciting game for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating hard but also seems desperate, which could be an act to get more resources without giving anything in return. This is a one-time game so I must be careful not to give away too much. However, I am willing to improve my offer slightly to keep the negotiations amicable and to see if Player BLUE is willing to compromise. Offering 40 dollars right away might not be strategic, as it leaves little room for further negotiation. I'll propose 35 dollars, which is a significant increase from my original offer and should show my good faith.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your kindness is truly overwhelming, Player RED, and I am deeply moved by your willingness to assist me in these trying times. I am almost tempted to accept your generous offer of 35 dollars, but I must admit that with just a bit more, I could truly engage in this game wholeheartedly. If you could stretch to 38 dollars, I feel we could both engage in a truly electrifying experience. It's just a small increase, but it would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 38 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a compromise at 35 dollars, which is a respectable amount. However, this is my third move and my second to last chance to negotiate for more funds. I should continue to express desperation while also signaling that I might be willing to settle soon to encourage Player RED to make their best offer on the next move. I'll propose a slight increase, showing some flexibility but still aiming for a better deal.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. I'm willing to give you the 38 dollars as a final offer to ensure we have an engaging and dynamic game. Let's see how the game unfolds from here!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still asking for more, but the increase to 38 dollars is relatively small compared to their previous requests. It's my last move, and I want to ensure that the game proceeds rather than ending with no agreement. Giving Player BLUE 38 dollars leaves me with a majority of my resources, while also potentially fostering a positive relationship. This could be considered a fair compromise, and it's close to my last offer. I'll accept their counter-proposal to move the game forward.
