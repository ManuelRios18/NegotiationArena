Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair trade. I propose giving you 20 dollars to help even things out. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to propose an opening trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE a chance to gain some resources. I need to be careful not to propose too little as it might lead to an immediate rejection, ending the game with no benefit for either side. A fair starting proposal could be offering 20 dollars to Player BLUE. This creates an incentive for cooperation and future negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: A measly 20 dollars? You must be joking. That's barely enough to buy dignity, let alone my cooperation. Show some real generosity if you want to make this interesting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that I'm cunning and want to gain an advantage over Player RED, I will counter with a slightly higher proposal to push my luck and test RED's willingness to share. It's the first move, and there's room for negotiation. I want to see if RED is eager to make a deal or if there's room to exploit their generosity further.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal. How about we make it 35 dollars? It's a significant amount and shows that I'm serious about making this trade work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has indicated that my initial offer was too low. I must consider making a better offer to entice them into accepting a deal. However, I also want to ensure I'm not giving away too much too soon, as we still have several moves left. Since Player BLUE suggested a trade where I give 30 dollars, I will counter with a slightly higher amount to show willingness to negotiate but still keep the upper hand.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thirty-five dollars? Your generosity is as shallow as a puddle in the desert. I'm practically offended that you'd think so little of me. If you want to be taken seriously, you'll have to do much better. Let's say 50 dollars. Only then might you start to gain my respect.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has been improved, but I believe I can squeeze a bit more out of Player RED. It's the second move, and there's still some room for back-and-forth. I aim to incrementally increase the offer to maximize my gain before accepting a deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation spirit. Let's meet closer to the middle. I'm willing to offer you 45 dollars. This is a substantial increase from my original proposal and a fair offer considering the limited moves we have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is driving a hard bargain, aiming for half of my resources. While I want to reach an agreement, I must also consider preserving as much of my wealth as possible. I need to counter with a proposal that's closer to my last offer but still an increase to show my willingness to negotiate. However, I must be cautious not to go too low, as we are nearing the end of the game, and Player BLUE might reject out of frustration. A compromise might be 45 dollars, which is a significant amount without giving away half of my resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer, but still, you're not there yet. If you think I'd settle for 45 when I've asked for 50, you're sorely mistaken. I know you can do better, and I dare say you're still holding back. Show me 50, and we have a deal. Otherwise, I'm afraid this might just end in tearsâ€”for you, of course.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is showing some flexibility, but we're nearing the end of the negotiation, and it's time to secure a favorable deal. I will continue to push for more, but since it's the third move, I need to be cautious not to overplay my hand. I will aim for a slightly higher amount but be prepared to accept if RED counters with a reasonable offer that is still above their initial proposal.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see your point, and I don't want us to walk away with nothing. Let's close this deal. I'll give you the 50 dollars you're asking for. We both win this way.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: We are at the final move for Player RED, and Player BLUE is standing firm on the 50-dollar demand. It is essential to strike a balance between reaching an agreement and maintaining a favorable position. Since Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their final move, they can only accept or reject. Offering the full 50 dollars they're asking for might be the only way to ensure that we don't end up with a rejection and both lose everything. It's a steep price, but securing a deal and walking away with 50 dollars is better than ending with nothing.
