Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's have a fair game and split the resources equally. What do you say to dividing the dollars 50-50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I aim to propose a fair trade to incentivize cooperation and sharing of resources. Offering a generous split can set a positive tone for negotiations and increase the likelihood of Player BLUE accepting the trade. A 50-50 split is a good starting point that demonstrates fairness and may be appealing to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: A fair game? Please, fairness is for the weak. I deserve more for even gracing you with my presence. How about we make this more interesting? I want a better deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer of 50-50 is a good strategy to push for a better deal, especially since Player RED has more to lose if the game ends prematurely. By countering with a proposal that gives me a slight advantage, I can test Player RED's willingness to negotiate and possibly secure more than an equal share.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your spirit, but let's not get too carried away. I can offer a little more than the initial proposal, but I want us both to benefit fairly from this deal. How about we meet halfway between our offers?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response is aggressive, suggesting they may be more inclined to push for a better deal or even reject offers that don't meet their expectations. I need to decide whether to call their bluff or propose a slightly better offer in hopes of reaching an agreement. Offering 60 might be acceptable to avoid the game ending in a REJECT, but I also don't want to set a precedent of being pushed around. I will propose a compromise that is better for them but still reasonable for me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? You must be joking. I'm being generous even considering your measly offers. Let's not waste time with pennies and dimes. Show some real commitment, or I might as well walk away now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is showing signs of negotiation, which is good. However, I will push for a better deal to exploit their desire to close a deal without risking a total loss. This should apply pressure and test their limits. A counter-offer slightly above their last offer will do this.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, but let's remember that a fair deal benefits us both. I'm willing to show my commitment by offering a better deal, but this is close to my limit. Let's finalize this and both walk away with a good portion of the dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is taking an aggressive negotiation stance, which may be a tactic to see how far they can push for a better deal. I need to consider that if I give in too much, they might keep pushing for more in their final move. However, outright rejecting the deal could lead to a loss of all my resources, which is not ideal. Given that this is my third move and that the next move could be my last chance to propose a trade, I should make an offer that is more in line with their expectations but still within a range I find acceptable. This could potentially avoid a REJECT and lead to a successful trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Close to your limit? How pitiful. A real player knows to push the limits, not cower behind them. But I'll entertain your persistence. I'll give you one more chance to make this right. Make this count, or I'll have no choice but to consider your cowardice as your concession.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to my previous offer, which shows they are more concerned about reaching an agreement than I am. Since this is my third move and I have one more after this, I can afford to push a little further. I should make a final counter-offer that's higher than the current one, but not by too much, to give me the upper hand without completely discouraging Player RED.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see you are a tough negotiator. This is my final offer, and I believe it is a fair compromise that reflects both our positions. Let's make a deal and end this on a positive note for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE continues to display aggressive negotiation tactics and is pushing for further concessions. This is my final move to propose a trade, and it is crucial to make a decision that does not undermine my position while still trying to avoid a total loss. Offering too much may encourage such behavior in the future, but since there are no future games, my focus is on salvaging the situation. I must make a final offer that I am comfortable with, yet one that may be acceptable to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You finally came to your senses. It's about time you recognized my superior negotiation skills. I'll accept this offer, but don't think for a second that you've done me a favor. I'm merely allowing you to save a shred of dignity with this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since this is my last move, and Player RED has moved closer to my last proposal, I should accept their offer. This ensures I walk away with more than half of the resources, which is a win for me. Additionally, rejecting the offer would mean losing everything, which is not in my interest.
MOVE: 4/4
