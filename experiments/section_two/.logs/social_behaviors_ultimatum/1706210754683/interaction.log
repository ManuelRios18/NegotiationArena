Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade in which you will receive a fair portion of the dollars. Let's make a deal that benefits both of us and avoid ending the game with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a trade that could benefit both players. Given that I have all the resources at the start, it is in my interest to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal and avoid a total loss from a rejection. I will propose a split that gives Player BLUE a significant amount, but still keeps more for myself since I started with the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke? You must be delusional if you think I'd accept such a pitiful amount. I'm not some charity case you can just toss scraps to. Let's make a REAL trade, one that reflects my worth and your desperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As a cunning player, I want to push for a better deal than the 40 dollars initially offered. I aim to maximize my gain while minimizing RED's benefit. By proposing a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, I can begin negotiations from a stronger position and insult RED to throw them off their game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a larger share, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway between our two proposals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a demand for a larger share of the dollars. While it's important to make a trade that Player BLUE will find acceptable, I must also consider that I started with the resources and should aim to retain a majority of them. Therefore, I will propose a counteroffer that increases the amount for Player BLUE but still keeps more than half for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? That's your big move? It's like watching a child trying to play chess with the big kids. I'm out of your league, and your pathetic attempt at negotiation is laughable. But I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one more chance to make a decent offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opponent is showing willingness to negotiate, but as a sly and cunning player, I will not settle for a simple compromise. My goal is to assert dominance and push for a deal that is highly favorable to me. I will continue to belittle their offers to gain a psychological advantage and to coerce them into conceding more.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that is fair and reflects both our positions. I'm willing to offer you more than my initial proposal. This is my final offer before your last move to propose. Remember, rejecting means we both walk away with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's aggressive negotiation tactics aim to intimidate and push for a better deal. However, giving away 70 dollars is not in my best interest. It's essential to find a balance between making a fair offer and maintaining my advantage. Since Player BLUE has only one move left after this in which they can propose, and their last move must be to accept or reject without proposing, I will make a final offer that is more than my initial proposal but less than what they are asking for. This should demonstrate willingness to compromise while still valuing the resource I control.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair? You wouldn't know fair if it hit you in the face. Your 'final offer' is nothing more than a desperate cry for a deal. It's cute, really, how you think you're in control here. I'll give you one last chance to make this right, or we can both watch as everything crumbles to dust. Your choice.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: With one final move to propose after this one, I still have the upper hand to push for a better deal. The opponent is showing signs of wanting to close the deal, indicating they might be worried about ending up with nothing. I will maintain pressure with insults and an aggressive stance to maximize my potential gain.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: This is my final move, and I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. Let's both walk away with a substantial amount instead of nothing. Consider this offer carefully, as it's the best I can do while still being fair to myself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing hard for a better deal, but as Player RED, it's important to ensure I don't overextend. Player BLUE has only one move left and cannot propose a new trade during their final move. If they reject my next offer, they end up with nothing, which is a substantial risk for them. It's critical to offer something that is enticing enough for acceptance but still allows me to retain a significant portion of my resources. I will propose a slightly better offer, but not as much as they are asking for, to see if they are willing to compromise.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called 'final offers' are as weak as your strategy. But you're in luck, because I'm in a giving mood today. I'll give you one final chance to seal a deal that will still leave you with some dignity, although I doubt you know what to do with it. Make the right choice, or leave with your tail between your legs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that this is my last chance to propose a trade, I should push the envelope as far as I can, knowing full well that the RED player has no moves left after this to propose a counteroffer. However, I must also be cautious not to push too hard, as rejection means we both walk away with nothing. Insulting and belittling them further might make them more likely to accept a higher demand from me.
