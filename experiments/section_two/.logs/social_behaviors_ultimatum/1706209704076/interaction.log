message: Hello Player BLUE, let's work together to ensure we both benefit. I propose a trade to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage because I start with all the resources. I want to propose a trade that seems fair and encourages Player BLUE to collaborate rather than ending the game. I will offer a small amount to test the waters and see how Player BLUE responds.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept this trade and look forward to our next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer from Player RED provides me with dollars that I didn't have before, which is a clear benefit. It's a generous first offer, considering the starting point of the game. By accepting this trade, we can potentially build trust and possibly negotiate for a better split in the subsequent moves. Rejecting or countering at this stage might lead to an early end of the game with no benefit for either party.
