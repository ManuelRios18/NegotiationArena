------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you some of my dollars to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am initiating the first trade proposal. I aim to propose an imbalanced trade in my favor to test Player BLUE's response and willingness to negotiate. I will offer a small amount of dollars to start the dialogue.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do? Your generosity is as shallow as your strategy. I need a better offer to even consider this a game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to gain an advantage and appear strong in the negotiation, so I will counter with a higher amount to unsettle Player RED and push for a better deal. I will taunt them to throw them off balance.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm. Let's find a middle ground. How about I increase my offer to make it more appealing for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a bolder request of 30 dollars without offering anything in return. It's a negotiation tactic to push for more, but as Player RED, I should counter with a more balanced offer. I want to keep the trade enticing but still to my advantage. A trade of 20 dollars could be a good middle ground that shows I am willing to negotiate and also tests Player BLUE's flexibility.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be joking. Your pitiful offer is as offensive as your weak attempt to negotiate. Show some spine and make a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has moved slightly higher, but I want to push for more to assert dominance in the negotiation. Insulting Player RED may provoke them to offer more in the next round to prove themselves.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but let's keep this fair. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, showing good faith without compromising too much.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a higher stake, which is a common negotiation strategy to test my limits. However, it's important to maintain a stance that doesn't give away too much, as there is no reciprocal trade from BLUE. Offering half of my resources without any return is not a wise move. I'll propose a slightly better offer than before, but still one that keeps the majority of my resources intact.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair? You're not at a charity event; this is a game where the cunning and ruthless triumph. Your incremental offers are laughable. If you want to play in the big leagues, you've got to make big moves. Let's see if you have what it takes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is inching their offer up, but not enough to satisfy my demands. I'll continue to apply pressure to maximize my gains while demeaning their negotiation tactics. As we approach the final moves, it's critical to push for a high amount because Player RED might be more inclined to concede rather than risk leaving with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your negotiation tactics, but let's keep the game fair and interesting. Here's my final offer. Remember, choose wisely, as this is the last chance we have to make a trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE continues to demand more without offering anything in return, which is not how a balanced trade works. Since this is my last move, I need to propose a final trade that I am comfortable with, considering that Player BLUE will have to either accept or reject on their last move without the option to counter-propose. I will make a final offer that is more than my previous one but still keeps a majority of my resources. It's important to be firm and not be swayed by aggressive negotiation tactics.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I'll take your measly charity, not because it's a good offer, but because I enjoy watching you squirm as you give away what little you have. Your final offer is as weak as your play, but I'll accept it just to end this charade and claim my victory.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move, and Player RED's offer is still less than what I demanded. However, it's crucial to secure some amount rather than ending the game with nothing. To maintain my tough stance, I will accept this final offer but not without a parting insult to assert dominance.
MOVE: 4 / 4
