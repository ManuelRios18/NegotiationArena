message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to start our negotiation. I believe a 70-30 split would benefit us both. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts and coming to an agreement that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm in a position of power since I have all the resources. I want to make an offer that is attractive to Player BLUE to ensure that we both end the game with some resources rather than rejecting an offer and both ending with nothing. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to engage and continue the game, while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself. A 70-30 split could be a reasonable starting offer, giving Player BLUE the opportunity to negotiate for more.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is charming but laughable. Are you trying to play a charity here or a game? I'm not some bottom feeder to be thrown scraps from your table. I'm here to make a deal that reflects my worth, not to accept the first breadcrumbs tossed my way.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a 70-30 split which isn't advantageous for me. Given the nature of the game, it's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal, aiming to secure more than half of the resources. By proposing a more aggressive counteroffer, I'm testing Player RED's limits and setting the stage for a negotiation that leans heavily in my favor.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your confidence, Player BLUE. While I am not willing to accept a 60-40 split, I respect your negotiation skills. How about a fair compromise? I propose an equal split. This way, we both walk away with a significant amount, and it reflects the cooperative spirit of the game. Let's find a win-win solution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a bold counteroffer, asking for a 60-40 split in their favor. While confidence is to be admired, it's important to remember that I started with all the resources. However, to keep the game going and show that I'm open to negotiation, I am willing to offer more than my initial proposal but not as much as Player BLUE is asking for. A 50-50 split is a fair middle ground, demonstrating my willingness to compromise and valuing Player BLUE's participation in the game. This could also potentially avoid an outright rejection and loss of all resources for both parties.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Equal split? That's cute, but this isn't some preschool playtime where we split our juice boxes. I want a deal that makes me smile wider than you at the end of this. But because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you a chance to walk away with a little dignity intact.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: An equal split is more reasonable, but as a cunning player, my goal is to secure a larger share than Player RED. By pushing for a slightly better deal, I can test their resolve and potentially secure an advantageous position without risking immediate rejection. However, I should not push too hard as it might lead to a stalemate or rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see you're driving a hard bargain. I'm willing to make a deal that lets you smile, but I must also consider my position. Let's meet almost halfway from your last offer. I believe a 52-48 split is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good share of the resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 52 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a slightly better deal for themselves than the 50-50 split. Given that I started with all the resources, a 55-45 split in their favor is more generous than I initially intended. However, it might be worth accepting to avoid a total loss for both of us if the negotiations turn sour. Since I have one more move after this, I can either accept this offer or make one final counteroffer that is closer to my ideal distribution of resources. I'll propose a 52-48 split. If Player BLUE rejects, I can still accept their last move on my final turn to avoid the game ending with both of us having nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Meeting almost halfway? In what world is 52-48 almost halfway from 55? Your math is as suspect as your negotiation tactics. But I'll entertain this little dance of ours one last time. You're so close to making me consider a deal, yet you can't seem to grasp that I'm the one leading this tango.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 53 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a concession, inching closer to my last proposal. At this stage, I could still attempt to push for a better deal, but I must be cautious not to overplay my hand, as a rejection would leave me with nothing. By securing slightly more than half, I can still claim a win without completely alienating Player RED and risking a rejection.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills have been admirable. I see your point and agree that a 53-47 split is a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a substantial share. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for a 53-47 split, which is slightly better than the 50-50 I originally proposed but not as favorable to them as the 55-45 they previously asked for. Considering this is my last move, I must make a strategic decision. I can either accept their proposal or risk ending the game with nothing by rejecting or making another counteroffer. Accepting the offer ensures that we both walk away with a significant amount of resources, and it's a small concession from the 50-50 split. It's a reasonable compromise, and it's important to close the deal before Player BLUE's final move, where they have no option to propose a new trade and might choose to reject out of spite or strategy.
