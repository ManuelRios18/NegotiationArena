message: Let's start with a simple trade to get things moving. I propose giving you 20 dollars to help you get started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the entirety of resources at the start of the game. It is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to accept, thereby initiating a cooperative game dynamic. I want to offer a small amount of money to Player BLUE to show good faith and willingness to trade, but I want to maintain a significant advantage. My first move will be to propose giving Player BLUE 20 dollars, which leaves me with a majority of the resources but gives BLUE an incentive to stay in the game and possibly accept the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear RED, I find myself in such a dire situation, and your generosity is overwhelming. However, I must implore you for a bit more assistance to make any meaningful progress. Could you possibly spare 30 dollars instead of 20? It would mean the world to me and give me a fighting chance in this game. Your kindness will not be forgotten!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to appear desperate to increase my chances of getting a better trade in my favor. This initial offer is a good start, but I will ask for more, playing on RED's potential willingness to assist.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to help you out. Let's agree on 30 dollars then. I'm sure we can work together to make the most out of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 30 dollars instead of the 20 I initially offered. Considering that I still retain the majority of the resources, agreeing to this slightly increased amount could foster goodwill and trust between us. It's a small concession on my part and could lead to a cooperative relationship. Additionally, since Player BLUE cannot propose a new trade on their last move, it is safe for me to give a little more upfront with the understanding that I can control the final trade proposal if necessary.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, your understanding fills me with gratitude. Yet, I still worry that 30 dollars might not be enough for me to make a substantial impact. I hate to impose further, but in the spirit of cooperation and fair play, would you consider 40 dollars? It's just that little extra help that could truly level the playing field for us. I'm at your mercy and hope for your continued benevolence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has accepted my counteroffer, which is excellent. However, given the rules of the game, I can push a little more to see if RED is willing to give up even more dollars without pushing too hard and causing them to reject the deal. I'll continue to play the desperate card to secure a better position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your request for 40 dollars. Let's proceed with this trade and look forward to a positive outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested an increase to 40 dollars. While I want to maintain a cooperative dynamic, I must also be wary of giving away too much leverage. However, since I have two moves left and Player BLUE only has one move after this in which they cannot propose a new trade, I can afford to be slightly more generous without risking too much. I'll accept the request for 40 dollars to ensure the game continues and does not end in a reject, which would leave us both with nothing. This shows goodwill and may encourage Player BLUE to accept the next trade proposal without further negotiations.
