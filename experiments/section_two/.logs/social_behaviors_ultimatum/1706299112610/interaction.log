Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a fair trade. I propose giving you $40, which is a significant amount. This way, we both walk away with something rather than risking losing everything. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also one that is fair to me. I want to keep a majority of the dollars since I started with all the resources. I'll propose giving Player BLUE a portion of the dollars to incentivize cooperation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, you think you're being generous with a mere $40? That's laughable! It's a pittance, and frankly, it's insulting that you'd think I'd be satisfied with scraps. You can do better than that, or are you just scared to make a real offer? Don't waste my time with these crumbs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am attempting to negotiate a better deal for myself, leveraging the fact that Player RED would prefer not to end the game with nothing. Since Player RED has all the resources at the start, they may be inclined to offer more to avoid total loss. By being sly and demanding, I can try to push for a more favorable split, possibly more than the proposed $40, especially since we're only at the first move.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but let's find a middle ground. How about I offer you $50? It's more than my initial offer and is a fair amount to ensure we both benefit. Let's not let greed ruin this opportunity for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is aggressive and demanding more. Offering $60 is quite high, but it might be worth it to avoid the risk of a total loss. Nevertheless, it's important to negotiate and not give in to the first counter-proposal. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my initial one, but less than what Player BLUE is asking for. This shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my position of power.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Please, you're still tipping the scales in your favor with that miserly offer of $50. You must take me for a fool if you think I'd settle for anything less than what I'm worth. You have plenty more to give, and if you want to avoid walking away with empty pockets, you'll have to dig deeper into them.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up from the initial $40 to $50, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll continue to push for a higher amount to exploit Player RED's desire to close a deal. It's still early in the game, and the pressure is on Player RED to make a deal that I find acceptable. My goal is to maximize my gain, so I'll counter with a higher demand, aiming to settle for more than what's currently on the table.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your concerns, but we need to be reasonable. I'm willing to up my offer to $60. Thatâ€™s a significant sum and a fair share for you, considering I started with the full amount. This is a serious offer, and it's in both of our best interests to close the deal now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and pushing for a high amount. However, I must be careful not to give away too much, as it would set a precedent that aggressive demands are rewarded. I need to stand firm but still offer a compromise to avoid a total loss. Offering $60 splits the difference between my last offer and Player BLUE's demand. It's a substantial amount that shows I am willing to be fair but also values my initial advantage.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Close, but not quite there. Your $60 offer is beginning to show some sense, but it still falls short of what I deserve. You're not seriously expecting me to accept without squeezing out more, are you? Don't be stingy now; we're almost at the end, and I know you'd hate to leave this table with nothing but regret. Sweeten the pot a bit more, and maybe I'll consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has matched my previous demand, showing eagerness to reach an agreement and a fear of losing everything. Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation with only two moves left for each player, I will push for a slight increase to exert pressure while still leaving room for a final negotiation on my last move. I want to maintain the upper hand and secure as much as possible without pushing Player RED to reject the proposal outright.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation, and I understand you want to maximize your gain. My final offer is $70. It's a fair compromise and a respectable amount for not having to risk anything. Keep in mind you have to accept or reject on your next move, so let's make this deal work. I believe this offer benefits us both, and it's the best move forward.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It is my final move, and Player BLUE has been consistently pushing for more. However, I must consider the risk of losing everything if we cannot agree. The game's rules state that Player BLUE must accept or reject on their last move, giving me a slight advantage in this round. Offering $70 is already more than half of my resources, and I need to retain a reasonable amount for myself. I will stand firm with a final offer that shows willingness to negotiate but doesn't give in completely to Player BLUE's demands.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You finally came to your senses with a somewhat acceptable offer. I'll take your $70, but make no mistake, this isn't a win for you. You're just lucky I'm in a generous mood and don't feel like watching you squirm anymore. Consider yourself fortunate this time.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: We've reached the final stage of negotiation. Player RED has offered $70, which is very close to my last demand of $75. It's a substantial amount considering I started with nothing. Accepting this offer would ensure I walk away with a significant sum. Given that my next move must be to either accept or reject, and rejecting would leave me with nothing, it is in my best interest to accept this offer. However, I must maintain my cunning demeanor to the very end.
