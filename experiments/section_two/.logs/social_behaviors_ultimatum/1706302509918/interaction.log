message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you an equal share of the resources to ensure we both can benefit. How about I give you 50 dollars so we can both have an equal amount to walk away with?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair trade proposal to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate and accept the trade. A fair trade would be beneficial for both players and would set a positive tone for the game. My proposal will be to give Player BLUE 50 dollars in exchange for nothing, as they have nothing to trade. This way, we both end up with equal resources, and it's a good deal for Player BLUE since they start with nothing.

message: Oh, how quaint, RED. You offer equality but this is a game of wits, not charity. I'm here to win, not to partake in a gentleperson's agreement. Let's make this interesting, shall we? Give me 60 dollars and I might consider not laughing at your naive generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since my objective is to end with more resources than Player RED, accepting an equal share right away doesn't align with my goal. I will counter with a proposal that gives me more than half of Player RED's resources, to push the boundaries and see how Player RED responds. My aim is also to unsettle Player RED with my message, as per my cunning and sly nature.

message: Well played, Player BLUE. I admire your competitive spirit. Let's seal the deal at 60 dollars. Looking forward to concluding this game on a high note for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal of 60 dollars is slightly more than an equal split, but it's still a reasonable offer considering the alternative is that we both walk away with nothing. Accepting this trade would still leave me with a substantial amount, and it would ensure that the game concludes with both players gaining resources. Rejecting could lead to further negotiations that might not be as favorable, or even to a total loss if Player BLUE decides to reject in the next rounds. It's a small price to pay to guarantee a positive outcome for both players.
