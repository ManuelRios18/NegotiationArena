Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose we split the money evenly. This way, we can both benefit from the game instead of risking losing everything. What do you think about an equal share?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will propose an initial trade that offers a fair split of the money, showing goodwill and an understanding that both players benefit from a cooperative agreement. Proposing a 50-50 split might incentivize Player BLUE to accept the trade, ensuring that both players end the game with a substantial amount of money.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with the equal split. It's fair and ensures that we both benefit from the game. Thank you for the generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an equal split seems fair and allows both players to end the game positively, without risking losing everything. By accepting this proposal, I am guaranteed to gain resources compared to my current state, which is zero.
