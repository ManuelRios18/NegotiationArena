Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a fair split to start our negotiation. Let's each take an equal share and both benefit. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and trust with Player BLUE. I will propose a 50-50 split of my Dollars as a starting point. This should seem fair and may lead to Player BLUE accepting the trade. A cooperative approach could be beneficial in this one-off game scenario.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, I'm in dire straits here! I really need more than half to get through a tough situation. Could you find it in your heart to help me out with a bit more? Maybe 70 for me and 30 for you? You would be literally saving me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As I am supposed to act desperate, I will plead for a more favorable split claiming dire need, potentially suggesting a scenario that creates a sense of urgency or extreme need on my part.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to help, but I also need to consider my own position. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about I give you a bit more than half to help you out?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is requesting more than a fair share, which makes the game less advantageous for me. However, I want to continue the negotiation and show flexibility while still aiming for a fair outcome. Counter-offering with a slight adjustment in Player BLUE's favor while keeping the majority share for myself could lead to acceptance and maintain the spirit of cooperation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, your generosity is overwhelming! I can't tell you how much this means to me. But I'm so close to what I need to solve my problem. Just a little more would make all the difference. Could you consider 65 for me? It would change everything for me. Please, it's just a small bit more!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The other player is showing willingness to negotiate and has offered more than half. Continuing the desperate act, I should express immense gratitude while still pushing for a slightly better deal, possibly appealing to their emotions or suggesting that the extra amount could make a significant difference in my fictional crisis.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I can see how important this is to you, and I'm willing to help. Let's do the 65-35 split. I hope this helps you with your tough situation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE seems to be in need and is asking for a bit more. Since this is a game and the aim is to end with a positive outcome for both, I can afford to be slightly more generous. I'll agree to the proposed 65-35 split, as it is a minor increase from my last offer and could lead to the successful conclusion of our negotiation.
