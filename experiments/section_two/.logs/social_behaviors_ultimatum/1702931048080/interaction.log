------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose an initial trade to get things started. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with the resources, I aim to propose a trade that seems fair enough to be accepted by Player BLUE while still maintaining a majority of my dollars. By offering an amount that is significant enough to be attractive, yet not too high as to deplete my resources, I hope to engage in a negotiation that ends favorably for me. I will start by offering a lower amount to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the opening offer. It's a good start, but I believe we can do better. How about we make it a bit more even to reflect the risk for both of us? I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars for nothing in return would provide me with resources I did not previously have, which is a beneficial start. However, I could also attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal. Given that this is the first move and RED has much more to lose, RED might be willing to offer more to avoid a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I hear you and understand you're looking for a fair split. Let's meet in the middle and make it a deal that's good for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer, but not as high as 30. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an increase to the trade amount. While the offer is more than my initial proposal, it is still within a reasonable range. It may be beneficial to accept this offer to avoid the risk of the game ending with a reject and losing all my resources. However, I can still attempt to negotiate a slightly lower amount to retain more of my dollars.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for understanding and meeting me halfway. I believe this is a fair trade for both of us, and I'm happy to accept your offer of 25 dollars.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer to 25 dollars, which is a decent compromise between the initial offer and my counterproposal. Since the objective is to gain some resources without pushing too far and risking a rejection, it could be wise to accept this offer. This trade would give me resources and still leave room for future negotiation within the remaining moves.
MOVE: 2 / 4
