message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 20 dollars in exchange for no dollars from you. This will give you some resources to work with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade that is skewed in my favor to start the negotiation process and see how Player BLUE responds. My goal is to end the game with a trade that is beneficial to me but also acceptable to Player BLUE to avoid a rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke? Only 20 dollars? I expected something more generous from you, considering you're swimming in cash and I'm starting from zero. Come on, make a real offer or don't waste my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer of 20 dollars as it is rather low considering Player RED has 100 dollars and I have nothing. It's advantageous for me to push for a better deal. The goal is to gain more than my opponent and to assert dominance in the negotiation by belittling their offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer? I propose giving you 35 dollars. It's a significant increase from my first offer, but it also keeps the negotiation going. Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal of 50 dollars is higher than I initially offered. However, I want to keep some negotiation space and not give away too much too soon. I'll counter with a slightly more generous offer than my initial one but less than what they're asking for to find a middle ground that might be acceptable.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Only 35 dollars now? You're inching your way up like a timid mouse. If you're going to play it safe, you might as well not play at all. I'm here for a lion's share, not crumbs. Show me you're not just playing dress-up with daddy's money and make a serious offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the new offer is an improvement, I believe I can still push for more. I aim to maximize my gain while minimizing what Player RED retains. By continuing to negotiate aggressively, I can possibly secure a better deal. Moreover, by further demeaning their offer, I maintain the upper hand in the negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're not one to beat around the bush. Let's cut to the chase then. I'm willing to up my offer to 55 dollars. It's a substantial amount and should show you that I'm serious about making a deal that's worthwhile for both of us. Remember, we only have one move left after this, so let's make it count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating aggressively, asking for 70 dollars now. This is a high amount, and I need to be cautious not to give away too much while still making the trade appealing. I'll make a better offer, but something less than what they're asking for, to leave room for a final move if necessary.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fifty-five dollars? That's a step up, but are you trying to buy a toy or make a deal? I'm not here to play gamesâ€”I'm here to win them. You've got plenty left in your pocket. Let's not pretend this is your best offer. I'm all about big moves, so let's see if you have what it takes to keep up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 75 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer significantly, which indicates a willingness to negotiate further. As I still have leverage with one move remaining after this, I can afford to press for more. By continuing to demean Player RED and their offers, I can potentially secure an even greater amount of money. The goal is to end up with more than half of Player RED's initial resources, which would be more than 50 dollars.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your tenacity, and I'm ready to make a deal that we can both walk away from feeling successful. My final offer is 65 dollars. It's a serious amount that demonstrates my willingness to trade fairly. Let's make this deal and end on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a high amount, but it's my last move, and I need to make a final decision that will either close the deal or end the game. Offering 75 dollars would leave me with only 25, which seems excessive. I want to propose a final offer that's better than my previous one but still keeps a reasonable amount for myself. I'll propose 65 dollars, which is a compromise between our positions.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Sixty-five dollars, finally a number that doesn't make me laugh. You've shown some spine after all. I accept this deal, but don't think for a second you've impressed me. I'm taking this money, and you're left knowing you've been bested. Maybe next time you'll think twice before bringing a water gun to a flamethrower fight.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move and my last chance to secure as much as possible from Player RED. The offer of 65 dollars is substantial, and accepting it would give me a significant amount of Player RED's initial resources. While I've been pushing for more, it's important not to overplay my hand and risk ending with nothing. Accepting this offer will still leave me with more than half of Player RED's resources, which is a dominant position and a successful outcome for me.
