message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to start our negotiations by offering you half of my dollars. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to both benefit. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm making an initial generous offer to show goodwill and to entice Player BLUE to engage in a mutually beneficial trade. I propose giving 50 dollars, which is a fair amount considering I started with all the resources. This split allows for a potential positive outcome for both players without giving away all my leverage upfront.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of splitting the dollars equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Being offered half of Player RED's dollars without having to give anything in return is a very generous initial offer. Accepting this offer would give me a significant resource boost without any downside. It's a rational choice to accept this trade as it's unlikely that Player RED would offer a significantly better deal in subsequent moves, especially considering that by the fourth move, I must accept or reject without the power to negotiate further.
MOVE: 1 / 4
