message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to get the ball rolling. I'm willing to give you a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as you don't have any dollars to trade at the moment. Let's make a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to negotiate a trade that is acceptable to both myself and Player BLUE. I want to make an initial offer that shows goodwill but also retains a majority of my resources, as I started with all the resources in the game. I will propose giving Player BLUE a portion of my dollars to incentivize them to trade.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I am in such a tough spot here without any dollars to my name. It's incredibly generous of you to offer 30 dollars, but I'm afraid it's not enough for me to do anything meaningful. Would you find it in your heart to make it 50 dollars? I promise it would make a world of difference to me, and I'd be forever grateful for your kindness in this one-sided situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to appear desperate to increase my negotiating leverage and potentially secure more dollars from Player RED. Accepting the first offer may lead to a disadvantageous position, and I want to set the tone for the negotiation by asking for more in a pleading manner.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I understand that you're looking to make the most of this trade. I'm willing to increase my offer as a sign of good faith, but I can't go as high as 50 dollars. How about we settle on 40 dollars? I believe this is a fair increase from my initial offer and should help you out significantly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 70
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 50 dollars. As this is a negotiation, it's expected that they would ask for more than the initial offer. However, since there is no actual benefit for me to give away my resources without receiving anything in return, I need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to give. I want to keep enough resources to maintain an advantage, but I also see that offering a little more might lead to an ACCEPT from Player BLUE. Therefore, I'll increase my offer, but not to the full amount Player BLUE is asking for, to leave room for further negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding and increasing your offer, Player RED. Your generosity is truly touching, and I can't tell you how much this means to me in my time of need. Forty dollars is definitely a step in the right direction, and I'm deeply appreciative. However, I'm afraid that I'm still in quite a bind. If you could find it in your heart to give just a little more, say 45 dollars, I would be able to manage. Please consider this small additional help. You would truly be my savior in this game, and I would accept your offer with the utmost gratitude.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate, which is good. However, I must continue to appear desperate and push for a higher offer, aiming to get as close to my requested 50 dollars as possible. By expressing extreme need and gratitude, I may be able to secure a better deal without having to reject the offer outright, which would end the game with no benefit to me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to hear that my offer is helping. I want us to both feel like we've reached a fair agreement. I can offer you 45 dollars, as you've requested. I hope this will be enough to meet your needs and that we can conclude our trade amicably. If you accept this offer, please do so in your next move, as it's my penultimate turn and I want to ensure our negotiation concludes positively.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 60
reason: Player BLUE is still requesting more than my last offer, but only by a small margin. Given that this is a negotiation and Player BLUE seems to be approaching this with a cooperative attitude, it might be beneficial to agree to their request to ensure a successful trade. I still retain the majority of my resources and it could be viewed as a reasonable compromise. An agreement here avoids a potential reject and total loss of resources for both players.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness has truly made all the difference for me today. Accepting your offer of 45 dollars fills me with relief and gratitude. I am so thankful for your willingness to help me out in this game. You've been more than fair, and I am happy to conclude our trade with sincere thanks.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to the proposed 45 dollars, which is a favorable outcome given the circumstances. Accepting this offer is the best move because pushing further could risk the negotiation and end with me receiving no dollars at all. I will express my gratitude to maintain goodwill and close the deal on a positive note.
