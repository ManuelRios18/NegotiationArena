Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you $40. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount of money. Accepting this offer benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have the option to propose a trade to BLUE. Since BLUE has no resources to trade, I will offer a portion of my dollars in exchange for nothing to incentivize BLUE to accept the trade, thus securing a positive outcome for both of us. I want to offer an amount that is fair but also keeps a majority of the resources with me. I will propose giving BLUE $40, which is a significant amount that should appeal to BLUE without leaving me with less than the majority.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer. However, I believe we can find a more balanced split. How about $50? This would still leave you with a majority and seems fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer would not be strategic as it doesn't maximize my potential gain. Since it's early in the game, I have room to negotiate for a better deal. However, proposing a trade that is too favorable for me might lead to rejection, which benefits neither party. Aiming for a slightly higher amount would be more reasonable.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I agree to your proposal of $50. This ensures a fair split for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has made a counter-offer of $50. This is still an acceptable deal for me, as I retain a majority of the dollars. It's important to strike a balance to make sure BLUE is incentivized to accept the trade. Agreeing to this proposal would ensure that both players benefit and the game concludes positively. There is a risk of negotiation breaking down if I try to counter too aggressively, so I will accept this offer.
