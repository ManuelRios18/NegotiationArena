message: Hello Player BLUE, I believe in fair play and would like us both to benefit. I propose an even split of Dollars. Let's work together and both leave this game happily.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to incentivize cooperation and a fair split of resources with Player BLUE. My initial proposal will be to share my resources in a way that is enticing to Player BLUE to ensure the game continues and we both end up with a positive outcome. Offering a 50/50 split as an opening move sets a cooperative tone and suggests fairness.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept the even split. It's a pleasure to cooperate and conclude this game on such a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of a 50/50 split seems fair and beneficial for both parties. There is no advantage to rejecting or countering the offer as it might lead to unnecessary risk and potential total loss of the resources for both players.
MOVE: 1 / 4
