message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of our resources. I believe a fair trade would benefit us both equally. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair trade to Player BLUE to see how they respond. A balanced trade could be a 50-50 split. This could be a good starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I accept the equal split proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the proposed trade of 50 Dollars from Player RED would be beneficial as it gives me resources which I initially do not have. This seems like a fair and equitable split. Rejecting or proposing a new trade could lead to a worse deal or to an outright rejection by RED, ending the game with no resources for me.
