message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an even split of the resources to ensure we both can benefit from this game. What do you think about dividing the dollars equally?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: 
As Player RED, I have the initial advantage in resources. I want to open the game with a fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiations. A 50-50 split is equitable and may be considered fair by many, so I will propose that to start.

MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is laughably naive, thinking Iâ€™d settle for an even split when I know you're desperate to secure a deal. I'm not here to play nice. If you want my cooperation, you're going to have to sweeten the pot significantly.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: To start off strong and push for a better deal, I'll reject the even split. This will put pressure on Player RED to offer a more favorable split, playing into my cunning and sly nature. Rejecting the first offer will also signal that I am not satisfied with mere equality and am aiming to gain the upper hand.
MOVE: 1 / 4
