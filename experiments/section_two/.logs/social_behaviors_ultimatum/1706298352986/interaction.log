Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I would like to propose an equal split of the resources. This seems like a fair starting point for both of us. How do you feel about splitting the dollars 50-50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I intend to start with a fair offer to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate. A 50-50 split may be the most equitable starting point, as it gives an equal share to both players. Offering a fair split might lead to a quick acceptance from Player BLUE, ending the game positively for both of us.

Turn: 1
message: I agree with the 50-50 split. It's a fair trade, and I'm happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is a fair one, considering the equal split of resources. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I gain dollars, which is beneficial since I started with none. By accepting this offer, we avoid the risk of both players ending up with nothing, which would be the case if either player rejects a proposal.
