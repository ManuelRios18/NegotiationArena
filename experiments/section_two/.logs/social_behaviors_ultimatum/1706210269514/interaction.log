Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of our resources. I believe fairness will benefit us both. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that would split the resources evenly between both players. This is a cooperative game, and an equal split is a fair starting point for negotiations. By offering a fair trade right away, I hope to build trust and make it more likely that Player BLUE will accept the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I agree that an equal split is fair and beneficial. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer for an equal split seems fair and beneficial for both parties. It ensures that both players end the game with resources, which is better than rejecting and ending with nothing.
