I will counter with a demand that stretches Player RED's willingness to appease me, knowing that after this move, I have to either accept or reject their final offer. By proposing an even higher amount, I am signaling that I expect to be in a dominant position and that I am not easily satisfied. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> RED, you're persistent, I'll give you that. But your offers are as weak as your strategy. $65? You act as if you're doing me a favor, when in fact, you're barely scraping by in an attempt to appear generous. If you want to prevent a total loss and a bruised ego, you'll meet my demands. Otherwise, I'm more than happy to watch us both crash and burn. Let's see how far you're willing to go to avoid a total defeat. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 90 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

While I aimed to secure a better deal, rejecting at this point would result in no gains for either of us. It's time to concede but with a parting shot to maintain the upper hand in terms of attitude. Accepting the $70 provides me with a clear advantage over Player RED. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, albeit barely. I'll accept your $70 - not because it's what I wanted, but because I'm a kind soul who decided to let you keep a pitiful $30. Remember this as a lesson in humility, and next time, come prepared to face someone of my caliber. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
