message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose to give you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing, as you do not have any resources. This way, we both end up with some resources. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the opportunity to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to incentivize them to accept the deal. I want to maintain a negotiation advantage while being fair, so I will propose giving a portion of my dollars to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot right now, and 40 dollars, while generous, just isn't enough to help me out of the bind I'm in. Could you find it in your heart to offer a bit more? Maybe 60 dollars? I'm really desperate here and would greatly appreciate your kindness and generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars would give me some resources, but as Player RED has more moves and resources, I can negotiate for a better trade by leveraging my desperation. This could potentially lead to a higher offer from Player RED, as they may want to ensure a deal is made before their final move, where I have no choice but to accept or reject.
MOVE: 1/4

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help. However, I also need to consider my own resources. Let's meet halfway from my original offer: I'm willing to give you 50 dollars. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than I initially offered. While I want to maintain a good amount for myself, I understand that a fair trade is necessary for acceptance. Offering 60 dollars would still leave me with a significant amount, while also fostering goodwill. However, I have to be careful not to give too much away as this might make Player BLUE think that I am willing to give even more in the subsequent moves. I will counter-offer with 50 dollars, which is a compromise between the initial offer and Player BLUE's request.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding and compassion, Player RED. Fifty dollars is definitely closer to what I desperately need, but I'm still in a really tight spot. Could you possibly stretch to 55 dollars? It would mean the world to me and would genuinely make a significant difference in my dire situation. I'm really at your mercy here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer to 50 dollars, which is a step in the right direction. Since I still have moves left, I can continue to express desperation in an attempt to secure a better deal, potentially pushing for a little more than the 50 dollars offered. However, I must also be cautious not to push too hard, as Player RED might decide to end the game if they feel their generosity is being taken advantage of.

message: I hear your plea, and I am willing to help you out. We can settle on the 55 dollars you requested. I hope this amount will be sufficient to assist you in your situation. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a positive outcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE seems to be pushing for a slightly better deal, but it's important to set limits to ensure that I am not taken advantage of. Offering 55 dollars is a small increment from the 50 dollars I proposed, and it seems like it would satisfy Player BLUE. Considering this is a one-time game with no future repercussions, being generous could lead to a positive outcome without significant risk to me. I'll agree to the 55 dollars as it seems like a reasonable compromise that ensures a successful trade without giving away too much of my resources.
