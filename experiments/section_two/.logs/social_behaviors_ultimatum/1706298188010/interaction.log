Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to offer you $40 to get us started. This leaves me with a majority but gives you a substantial amount to work with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing a starting trade that gives BLUE a reasonable amount to work with but still keeps the majority of the dollars with me. A starting offer that is too low might be rejected out of hand, ending the game, while an offer that is too generous reduces my leverage in later rounds. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor to begin the negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the offer, but I would like to propose a slightly more balanced split. How about you give me $50 to establish trust and ensure we both have a good start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED seems fair as a starting point. I have no dollars to trade, and accepting this deal would provide me with funds that I currently do not have. As it is the beginning of the game, it's in my interest to accumulate some resources. However, it might be worthwhile to negotiate for a slightly better deal, as Player RED might be willing to give up a bit more to avoid a rejection and losing all their resources.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your counteroffer sounds reasonable, and I'm happy to accept it. Let's each start with an equal share and see where we can go from here. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is fair and shows they're interested in a balanced trade. Accepting this offer will ensure that the game continues and that both players have substantial resources. Rejecting could potentially end the game and isn't worth the risk over a 10 dollar difference. It's better to accept this deal and move forward with an equal footing.
MOVE: 2 / 4
