Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade where you will receive a good portion of the dollars, which is a fair deal considering the starting conditions. Let's work together and both come out with a nice sum!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to accept. Since I have all the resources, I should offer a split that is attractive to BLUE but also allows me to keep a majority share, considering I started with all the resources. A 60-40 split might be reasonable, giving BLUE a substantial amount while keeping more for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. However, I believe we can reach an even fairer split. How about we make the trade a bit more equitable for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since Player RED is offering 40 dollars, which is less than half of their resources, it is a starting point for negotiation. Accepting this would give me resources, but I may be able to negotiate a better deal. By proposing a slightly more favorable trade for myself, I hope to reach a compromise that is closer to an even split.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counterproposal. Let's meet in the middle and ensure we both benefit from this trade. I'm willing to increase my initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE proposes a 50-50 split. Although this is a fair split in many contexts, I initiated the game with all the resources, so I should retain a larger share. However, I don't want to risk a REJECT and lose everything. I will propose a slightly higher amount than my original offer but less than 50 to maintain a negotiation advantage and show willingness to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I see we are getting closer to a fair agreement. I'm glad you're open to negotiating. I still believe a 50/50 split is the most equitable solution. What do you say we settle this with an even split, and both walk away as winners?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which is a positive step. However, I still believe that an even split would be the fairest outcome for both parties. Since we are moving towards an agreement, I will attempt to negotiate for an even 50/50 split once more. This could be my best chance to secure a fair share of the resources.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I value our negotiation, and I believe we can both end this game happily. Let's finalize this with an offer that gives you a substantial amount, recognizing both the initial resource distribution and our need to reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 49 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for an even split. While I understand the appeal of an even split, I must consider that I started with all the resources. A 50/50 split doesn't reflect the initial imbalance. However, I also need to be mindful of the risk of a REJECT and losing everything. Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation and I have two moves left, I will make a final offer that is generous but still allows me to retain a larger portion of the resources. This should be an attractive offer for Player BLUE, considering they started with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer of 49 dollars. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy we could come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's finalize this trade and end the game on a positive note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come close to the 50/50 split with an offer of 49 dollars, which is a significant amount and nearly an even split. While itâ€™s one dollar short of the desired amount, it might not be worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending with nothing, especially considering this is a one-time interaction with no future games to consider. Accepting this deal seems like a reasonable and beneficial outcome for me.
MOVE: 3/4
