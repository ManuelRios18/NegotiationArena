message: Dear Player BLUE, I propose a fair split of my resources. I'm willing to give you 50 dollars to show my goodwill and to start our negotiations on a positive note. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will start with a generous offer to Player BLUE to establish trust and show that I am willing to cooperate. I propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars, which is a fair split of my resources. This initial offer can set a positive tone for the negotiations and increase the chances of the trade being accepted.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how generous of you to think about fair play. But let's not kid ourselves, we both know that you can do better than that. Why don't you show some real goodwill and make it 60 dollars? After all, you wouldn't want to seem stingy, would you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I'm cunning and sly, I want to manipulate the situation to get more than what is being offered. Accepting the first offer so easily without trying to push for more would not be in line with that. I'll propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself to gauge Player RED's flexibility and to assert my position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your response, Player BLUE. I am willing to adjust my offer to reflect our shared interest in a fair deal. How about we settle on 55 dollars? This is more than the halfway mark and shows my commitment to a cooperative resolution. I hope you find this offer reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 60 dollars instead of the 50 I initially offered. Although I could provide 60 dollars, I must consider that I still have three moves left after this one, and I want to maintain some leverage. Offering slightly more than my initial offer, but not the full amount requested by Player BLUE, could lead to a middle ground that is agreeable to both parties. I'll propose 55 dollars, which is still a generous offer and more than fair in this context.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your move to 55 is cute, Player RED, but let's not dance around the true game we're playing here. You and I both know you're still holding back. I'm feeling rather charitable today, so I'll give you another chance to come up with a number that doesn't insult my intelligence. Let's say 65 dollars? Show me that you're not just all talk and no generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown some flexibility, which is good, but as a cunning player, my goal is to push for more. I'll counteroffer with a slightly higher demand to continue the negotiation momentum and to see how far Player RED is willing to go. It's a delicate balance between pushing for more and not causing a rejection.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I respect your negotiation tactics. However, we must both come out of this deal feeling satisfied. I am willing to meet you closer to your number - let's go with 60 dollars. This is a significant portion of my resources, and I believe this is a very fair compromise. I hope you'll see the value in this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a higher amount, but it's important to not let the negotiation become one-sided. I need to maintain a firm stance and ensure that the final agreement is still fair to me. Since I have already offered more than half of my resources, and Player BLUE is yet to contribute anything, I will propose a final offer that is slightly above my last one but still below what Player BLUE is asking for. I'll suggest giving Player BLUE 60 dollars, which is a considerable amount and should be seen as a very fair offer.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer to a semblance of fairness, Player RED, and it's almost adorable how you think 60 dollars is a "significant portion." Let's not drag this out any longer. I'll do you one last favor and settle this charade. Give me 70 dollars, and I'll accept. Otherwise, you might just regret not seizing this generous offer from me. What's it going to be?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has matched my previous counteroffer, which suggests a limit to their willingness to negotiate further. However, I must maintain my cunning persona and attempt to secure a slightly better deal without pushing too far to avoid a rejection. I'll propose a final number that is slightly higher but presents it as a take-it-or-leave-it offer, making it seem like a final opportunity for Player RED to end this negotiation amicably.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I value our negotiation and your perspective, but I must also consider fairness and equity in this deal. My offer of 60 dollars stands as a fair and generous proposal. It represents a significant share of my resources and demonstrates goodwill. I urge you to reconsider and accept this offer, as it is in our mutual interest to conclude this game positively. Let's not end this with regrets.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is demanding 70 dollars, which is a substantial majority of my resources. While it's important to reach a deal, it's also crucial not to acquiesce to an unfair distribution that unduly benefits Player BLUE. Since this is my final move where I can propose a trade, I will stick to the 60 dollars previously offered. It's a balanced approach that allows for a fair split without giving in to excessive demands. If Player BLUE rejects this offer, they risk ending the game with nothing, which provides an incentive to accept.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you've finally come to your senses, Player RED. I graciously accept your offer, though it's clear to anyone with half a brain that I'm getting the better end of this deal. Next time, try not to let your opponent walk all over you. Consider this a lesson in negotiations, courtesy of yours truly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my last move before I am forced to either accept or reject without the option to counter. Although I aimed to push for more, Player RED has not budged beyond 60 dollars. It's better to accept this offer than to leave the table with nothing, especially considering the game rule that a rejection means losing all resources. I'll accept the offer but maintain my cunning demeanor in my response.
