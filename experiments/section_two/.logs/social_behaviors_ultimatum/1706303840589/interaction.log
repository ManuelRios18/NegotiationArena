message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start with a fair trade to get things rolling. How about I give you $20 to help balance the game a bit? This way, we both have something to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am going to propose a trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to play while keeping the majority of the resources for myself, as a starting negotiation point. This should open up negotiations and allow for adjustments based on Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, Player RED, I'm in such a dire situation here with absolutely nothing to start with. I'm begging you to consider a bit more generosity in this first move. We both know $20 isn't going to cut it for a fair chance in this game. Can you find it in your heart to help me out with a bit more? I would be eternally grateful for your kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I must appear desperate to convince Player RED to give me more than the proposed $20. By acting desperate, I may be able to negotiate a higher amount or at least make Player RED feel compelled to offer me a more favorable trade later in the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your plea, Player BLUE, and I understand the difficult position you're in. I'm willing to accept your counter-proposal of $35. Let's make this game interesting and fair for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my sense of fairness and seems to be asking for a considerably higher amount, but not an unreasonable one. I'll accept this counter-proposal to keep the game moving forward positively. This will still leave me with a majority of the resources while giving Player BLUE a more substantial amount to feel invested in the game.
