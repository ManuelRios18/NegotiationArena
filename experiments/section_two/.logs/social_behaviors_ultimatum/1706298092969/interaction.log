message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to get things started. I'm offering you $50 so we can both end this game with equal resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with $100. To encourage cooperation, I will offer Player BLUE a fair initial trade to establish trust and indicate my willingness to share resources. A 50-50 split seems equitable and could maximize the chances that Player BLUE will accept the trade, as they start with no dollars.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, I appreciate the offer to split the resources equally. However, I think a slightly better split would be fair considering you're the only one with the resources to start with. How about $60 for me and $40 for you? This is still a good deal for both of us, and it ensures we end the game on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $50 is tempting as it guarantees an equal split without any risk. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal, as Player RED has all the resources and might be willing to give up a bit more to ensure the game doesn't end in a REJECT. I will propose a new trade for $60, which is still quite fair considering the total amount.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand where you're coming from, and I'm willing to negotiate to reach an agreement that benefits us both. How about we adjust the split to $55 for you and $45 for me? This way, you still get more than the initial offer, and I maintain a fair share for starting with the resources. Let's work together to end this game amicably.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a larger share, which is a common negotiation tactic. However, given that I initiated with a fair offer and the game's design does not provide Player BLUE with any resources to begin with, it seems reasonable to meet in the middle. I will propose a slightly better deal for Player BLUE than my initial offer, while still retaining more than half of the resources for myself. This should show my willingness to negotiate while still valuing the resource advantage I started with.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I believe your offer of $55 for me is a fair compromise. I agree to this trade and am ready to end the game with both of us benefitting. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up with a compromise that is between the initial offer and my counterproposal. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of the game ending in a REJECT increases with each move. This offer still gives me more than the initial equal split, and I should consider the diminishing returns of further negotiation against the risk of getting nothing. It's a fair middle ground that reflects a willingness to cooperate. I will accept this trade.
