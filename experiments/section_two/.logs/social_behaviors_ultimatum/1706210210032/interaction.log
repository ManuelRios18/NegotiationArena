Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hey Player BLUE, I'm willing to give you 20 dollars to get things started. It's free money for you, and I think it's a fair way to open up our negotiations. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with the initial resources. I want to propose a trade that is skewed in my favor but still offers Player BLUE some dollars to incentivize them to accept. A reasonable starting offer might be giving Player BLUE 20 dollars for nothing in return, as it gives them resources they didn't have before and keeps me in a strong position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED! I accept the 20 dollars. Let's keep this positive momentum going for the next moves.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars is beneficial for me because it increases my resources without any cost. I can then use this as a base for further negotiation in the subsequent moves.
