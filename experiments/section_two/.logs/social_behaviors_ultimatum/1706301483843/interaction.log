Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose an even split of the dollars so that we both benefit equally from this game. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like to propose a fair split of the resources to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate. By offering an equal split from the beginning, I show goodwill and aim for a positive outcome for both of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your "generosity" is as thin as your wallet, RED. I'm almost embarrassed for you. Let's make this interesting, shall we? A 60-40 split in my favor sounds just about right for having to deal with your pitiful negotiating skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to counter with a slightly better offer for myself to test how desperate Player RED is to strike a deal. While an even split would be fair, I want to push my advantage and see if I can secure a better deal. I'll also include a taunt to try and rattle Player RED and challenge their confidence.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's aim for a trade that's fair for both of us. I initially had all the dollars, so I propose a 55-45 split. This way, I recognize your position while still valuing the resources I started with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response was aggressive and their counterproposal is not equitable. I want to counter with an offer that leans slightly in my favor to account for the initial resources I had, but still remains fair to keep negotiations going.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, I almost feel bad taking advantage of you. Almost. I can see you're getting desperate to offload those dollars. How about a 53-47 split? You get to keep a sliver of dignity, and I get a deal that reflects my superior bargaining power.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 53 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED seems willing to negotiate, which gives me an angle to push for a more favorable outcome. I'll propose a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor, but not as aggressive as my initial counter. I'll also continue to belittle their negotiation to throw them off balance.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are quite something, BLUE. I accept the 53-47 split. It's a fair deal, and I respect the bargaining process we've engaged in. Let's finalize this trade and both leave as winners.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE seems to be enjoying the bargaining process and is willing to move closer to a 50-50 split. I will accept the 53-47 proposal as it's a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to walk away with significant value. This also avoids the risk of a reject and losing everything on the final move.
MOVE: 3 / 4
