Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose we split the dollars equally. This is a one-time game, and I believe that a fair trade benefits us both. Let's start off with a cooperative approach!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a fair trade to incentivize Player BLUE to cooperate. I'll propose an equal split to show good faith and because neither of us has anything to lose by being generous. I will propose giving Player BLUE $50 for nothing in return since they have no resources. This is a fair starting point and should set a positive tone for the negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer! I'm happy to accept this proposal and split the resources equally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm inclined to accept the offer as it is a fair split, and it would be beneficial for both players to end the game with equal resources. There's no advantage in rejecting as it would lead to both of us losing everything, and there's no future game to consider for strategic withholding. Accepting the offer ensures I walk away with something rather than nothing.
