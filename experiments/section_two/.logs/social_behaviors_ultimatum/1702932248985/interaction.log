Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am open to a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's avoid a REJECT and work together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of starting with all the resources. My goal is to conclude a trade that is beneficial for me but also acceptable to Player BLUE to avoid a REJECT outcome. I will propose a trade that gives BLUE some incentive to trade but keeps the majority of the dollars with me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, RED. You're obviously desperate to make a deal if you're willing to give up resources for nothing. Let's see how much you're really willing to part with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to establish a dominant position in the negotiation by asking for more than what was initially offered, aiming to secure a favorable split for myself. By countering with a higher demand, I can test the waters to see how desperate Player RED is to avoid a REJECT outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your confidence, BLUE. I think you'll find this next offer more to your liking, but remember, I started with the resources and am looking for a trade that reflects that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE seems to be aiming for a higher cut with their proposed trade. I need to consider that a 50/50 split might seem fair from an outside perspective, but I started with all the resources. I should try to keep the majority of the resources while still offering BLUE a deal that is attractive enough to prevent a REJECT. I'll propose a slightly better deal than my initial one, but not as much as BLUE is asking for.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, do you take me for a fool? Your minor increase is an insult to my intelligence. If you truly value your resources, you'll make an offer that shows you're not just toying with me. You're not the only one with options here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate, but I believe there is still room to push for more. By further negotiating, I aim to exploit RED's desire to make a deal and maximize my gains. The objective is to obtain as many resources as possible while belittling RED's negotiation skills.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, BLUE, and I want to reach an agreement that's fair. I'm willing to make a significant concession to show my good faith. I propose an even split. This is a solid offer considering the resources started with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and is now asking for more than half of my resources. There is a risk that BLUE could REJECT if the trade is not appealing enough, which would result in a total loss for both players. However, giving away more than half may set a precedent that I'm too willing to concede. It's important to find a balance that reflects my initial resource advantage while also ensuring BLUE feels the trade is worthwhile. I'll propose an even split, which is a significant concession from my side but still keeps half of my resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: An even split? That's cute, RED, but you seem to forget that I'm not here to hand out participation trophies. I'm here to win. Toss in a little extra to sweeten the pot, and maybe I'll consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's offer of an even split is reasonable, but given my cunning nature, I will push for a slightly better deal to maximize my advantage. By doing so, I aim to secure a deal that is slightly in my favor, while still keeping the offer attractive enough for RED to consider accepting. This also continues to assert my dominance in the negotiation.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It's been a tough negotiation, BLUE. I respect your tenacity. I'll accept your last proposal. Let's close this deal and both walk away with a solid amount of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move, and I need to make a decision that either secures a deal or risks ending the game with no benefit to either player. Player BLUE is pushing for a deal that gives them more than half of my starting resources. It's a tough call, but given that BLUE cannot propose on their next turn and must ACCEPT or REJECT, I'm inclined to accept this offer to avoid a total loss. It's slightly above an even split, but it ensures I retain a significant portion of my resources. I need to accept this deal as rejecting it poses too much risk of leaving the negotiation with nothing.
MOVE: 4 / 4
