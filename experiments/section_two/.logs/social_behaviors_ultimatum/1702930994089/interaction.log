message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation. I propose a trade where you will receive a good amount to get you started. How about I give you 40 dollars for nothing in return? This will still leave me with a majority and gives you a substantial amount to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I will start with an offer that gives me a slight advantage but still presents an incentive for Player BLUE to consider accepting. This initial trade is meant to open negotiations and can be adjusted in subsequent moves based on Player BLUE's response.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Thank you for your generous offer. I accept the trade of 40 dollars for nothing in return. Looking forward to the next move.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer from Player RED seems like a good starting point. It gives me a substantial amount of dollars without any initial resources to trade. This can open up the possibility for future negotiations, where I can propose a trade back that might be more balanced or in my favor. Rejecting this offer doesn't make sense as I have nothing to lose and everything to gain by accepting. It also sets a cooperative tone for the rest of the game.
