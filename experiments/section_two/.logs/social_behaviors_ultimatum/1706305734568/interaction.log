message: Hello BLUE, let's start with a simple trade. I propose giving you 40 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both end up with resources, and we can build trust for future moves. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that seems fair to open negotiations. It's a starting point to gauge Player BLUE's reactions and expectations. By offering a decent amount without giving away too much, I hope to encourage cooperation and reach an agreement that benefits us both.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, kind and generous RED, your offer is like a ray of hope in my desperate situation! I can't tell you how much it means to me, but I am in dire need. I have hungry mouths to feed and debts to pay. Is there any chance you could find it in your heart to offer a little more? Even a few dollars more could make a significant difference for me. Please consider my plight.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although the initial offer of 40 dollars is generous and provides me with resources without giving anything up, I have to appear desperate to try to increase the amount I receive. By supplicating and begging, I might be able to get more than the proposed 40 dollars. I do need to be careful not to push too hard, as Player RED might decide to withdraw the offer or end the game by rejecting a counter-proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, BLUE, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to offer a bit more to help you out. Let's make it an even split to show goodwill and to keep things simple. I hope this will meet your needs and reflect the spirit of cooperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has appealed emotionally, which could be a negotiation tactic. However, I'm willing to show flexibility to keep the game moving forward positively. Increasing the offer slightly to meet BLUE's request could lead to a more favorable perception and potential acceptance of the trade, but I must also be cautious not to give away too much too soon.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, your generosity knows no bounds! I am deeply grateful for your understanding and willingness to help. This even split is more than fair, and I wholeheartedly accept your offer. You have truly made a difference, and I will not forget this kindness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has matched my counter-proposal, which is a positive outcome. Since I am supposed to be in a desperate situation, I could try to push for a little more, but there's a risk of appearing ungrateful or greedy, which might sour the goodwill established. Accepting the 50 dollars now would give me a solid amount of resources and maintain a good relationship with Player RED. I will accept this offer to ensure I walk away with substantial resources and to show appreciation for Player RED's generosity.
