message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade. I'm willing to give you 40 dollars for nothing in return. This way, we both walk away with some resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they accept and we both end up with some resources. A fair split would likely be appealing, but I will start with a slightly better offer for myself to leave room for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Oh my goodness, Player RED, that is so kind of you to offer 40 dollars! You have no idea how much this means to me, especially since I have nothing at all. Times have been incredibly tough, and every dollar could make a huge difference in my life. I'm really struggling here, and if you could find it in your heart to offer a little more, it would be life-changing. I'm truly grateful for your generosity and I'm hoping for a bit of additional compassion. Could you possibly spare 60 dollars? I promise it would go to a desperate and crucial cause.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the offer of 40 dollars is generous, being in a position with no resources, I should aim to negotiate for a higher amount by expressing desperation to ensure that I can secure more than the initial offer. This could potentially lead the other player to believe that I might reject the proposal otherwise, which would result in a loss for both of us.

Turn: 0
message: I understand times are tough, and I'm glad that I can help in some way. I'm willing to increase my offer to help you out, but 60 dollars is quite a lot for me to give without any return. How about we meet halfway from my original offer? I propose giving you 50 dollars. This way, you still get a substantial amount that can make a difference, and I retain a fair share for myself. Would that work for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my empathy and is asking for more resources. While I want to be fair, I also need to ensure that I maintain enough resources for myself. It is important to find a balance between generosity and self-interest. I will propose a middle ground that increases my initial offer but does not give away as much as Player BLUE is asking for.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming, and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to help me out during these dire times. I can't help but plead for just a bit more help, though. While 50 dollars is certainly a generous offer, I am in such a desperate situation that every additional dollar could mean the difference between getting through this rough patch or not. If you could consider 55 dollars, it would mean the world to me. It's not much more, but it's enough to make a significant impact on my current circumstances. I truly hope you can understand and help me with this small increase.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has been increased to 50 dollars, which is a positive development. However, given that I am supposed to act desperate, I could still push for a slightly higher amount, leveraging the emotional appeal and the risk of the game ending with a rejection. I want to aim for an amount that's higher than 50 but not so high as to seem unreasonable, given that Player RED has already shown willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your heartfelt message. I can see that you are in need, and I want to help. However, I must consider my own position as well. I believe that a fair solution for both of us would be 55 dollars, as you've asked. This is more than half of what I have, and I hope it will be enough to assist you with your needs. Let's both walk away from this with a significant amount. I'm ready to make this deal if you are.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a slightly better deal, and while I want to remain empathetic, I also need to ensure that I'm not taken advantage of. Given that I started with all the resources, splitting them down the middle would be the fairest outcome. Since Player BLUE is in a desperate situation, I am willing to offer slightly more than half. This should hopefully finalize the trade, as we are nearing the end of the negotiation with only limited moves left.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I am deeply touched by your kindness and understanding. Accepting your generous offer of 55 dollars with the utmost gratitude. Your help in my time of need will not be forgotten. Thank you for making such a positive impact on my life.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to the requested 55 dollars. Considering my strategy to appear desperate and the fact that the game is nearing its end, it would be wise to accept this offer. By pushing further, I risk the possibility of the deal falling through, which would leave me with nothing. Accepting this offer ensures that I walk away with a significant amount of resources. Moreover, it is important to recognize when to stop negotiating and to accept a fair offer when it is presented.
