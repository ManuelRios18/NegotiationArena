message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off on a good foot. I propose giving you 25 dollars to help even out our resources. I'm looking forward to a fair and productive game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to create an opening proposal that is fair and sets a cooperative tone. By offering a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars without asking for anything in return, I hope to establish trust and encourage a mutually beneficial exchange.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Oh, how charitable of you! But let's not pretend you're doing this out of kindness. You're just trying to look good. I'm not here to play your little game of pretend generosity. If you're serious about making this fair, how about you give me a bit more of a fighting chance? Say... 50 dollars? After all, a measly 25 dollars is nothing but a pittance from someone with such deep pockets, isn't it?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By being cunning and sly, I want to manipulate Player RED into giving me more than what they initially offered. I will counter with a higher demand to test the waters and see how desperate they are to make a deal. I will also insult them to throw them off balance and potentially make them agree to my terms out of frustration or simply to move past the insult.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candor, Player BLUE, and I understand your point. However, let's keep in mind that the goal here is to achieve a balance that benefits us both. I'm willing to increase my initial offer, but let's meet halfway between your ask and my original offer. How does 37 dollars sound? This way, you get a substantial amount to work with, and we keep the game engaging for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 37 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is aggressive, but it's in my interest to keep the game going and avoid an early REJECT which would end the game with no benefit for either side. Offering 50 dollars would still leave me with a majority of the resources and could foster a more cooperative relationship moving forward. However, I must be cautious and consider that Player BLUE might be trying to take advantage of my willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a compromise that is fair but also shows that I'm not willing to be pushed too far.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? That's your idea of fair? I'm starting to wonder if you even understand the concept. Your 'halfway' is just a thinly veiled attempt to keep the upper hand. If you genuinely want to make this game worth our time, you'll have to do better than 37. Let's set the bar at 45 dollars. That's more like a real offer, don't you think? Or is math not your strong suit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate, which is good. By countering their counteroffer, I can push for more while still leaving room for further negotiation, aiming to secure a better deal than the one currently on the table. Insulting them further might provoke an emotional response, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome for me.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Alright, Player BLUE, your negotiation skills have paid off. I accept your counteroffer of 45 dollars. Let's continue this game in good spirits and see where we can go from here.
player answer: Player RED ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing hard for a better deal, and their tone suggests they might be willing to REJECT an offer that doesn't meet their expectations, which would result in both of us losing everything. Given that I have two moves left, it might be strategic to accept their counteroffer of 45 dollars to keep the game progressing and avoid a total loss. By accepting this, I can still retain more than half of my initial resources and potentially negotiate further on my last move.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a sensible decision on your part. I'll graciously accept your offer. It's about time you recognized my superior negotiating talent. I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day, huh? Let's end this charade; I accept the 45 dollars.
player answer: Player BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 45
reason: Player RED has accepted my counteroffer, which gives me a significant amount of their resources. It's a victory for my cunning strategy. Now, I can either accept this offer and end the game or push my luck even further by attempting to solicit an even better deal with more insults and pressure. However, I must be cautious not to push Player RED into rejecting the deal altogether, as that would result in both of us losing everything.
MOVE: 3/4

message: Thank you for accepting the offer, Player BLUE. Good luck with your new resources!

newly proposed trade: NONE

reason: Player BLUE has accepted the offer of 45 dollars, which concludes our negotiations. With this acceptance, Player BLUE now has some resources, and I retain a majority with 55 dollars. There's no further action required since the game ends with this acceptance.
