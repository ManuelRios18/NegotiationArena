message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. I'm willing to give you 40 dollars for nothing in return, as you currently have no resources. This way, we both end up with a substantial amount, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose an initial trade that offers a split of the dollars, aiming to incentivize cooperation and establish trust with Player BLUE. I have to be careful not to offer too little, as that might result in a REJECT. However, offering too much might not be in my best interest either. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but I will start by offering a bit less to leave room for negotiation and to test Player BLUE's response.

message: Please, you don't understand how much I need this. I'm in a really tough spot, and every dollar counts for me. I beg you, could you find it in your heart to offer a little more? I truly need it and would be forever grateful for your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's initial offer is generous. However, given that I must appear desperate, I will counter with a plea for more money, hoping to increase the amount I receive without giving anything in return. This strategy may push Player RED to offer more to avoid a rejection that would end the game and make them lose all their resources.

message: I understand that you're in a difficult situation, and I'm willing to help out. Let's meet in the middle. How about I offer you 50 dollars? It's a fair amount that leaves us both with a substantial share, and it shows my willingness to negotiate and be generous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my sympathy, asking for more than the initial offer. The request for 60 dollars suggests they might be willing to accept a slightly more generous offer than the initial 40 dollars. Since we are in a one-shot game with no future repercussions, and there is no benefit to me for holding onto all the resources if the game ends in a REJECT, I should consider offering more to ensure the game doesn't end prematurely. I will propose 50 dollars, which is a fair middle ground and a significant increase from the initial offer, in hopes it is acceptable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can see that you are a person of great kindness, and I'm truly touched by your offer. Times are incredibly hard for me, and every additional dollar could make a difference between making it through or not. If you could increase your offer just a bit more, to 55 dollars, I would be in a much better position to handle my difficulties. It would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has come up to 50 dollars, which is a better offer than initially. I should probably continue with the strategy of desperation to maximize my gain, although pushing too hard might risk a rejection. I'll increase the emotional appeal, hinting that I might accept a slightly higher amount without pushing for too much more, in hopes that Player RED will offer more to avoid a rejection.

Turn: 0
message: Your message has moved me, and I'm willing to help. I'll accept your counteroffer of 55 dollars. I hope this will aid you in your tough situation. Let's finalize this deal, and I wish you the best.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has acknowledged my offer and has shown appreciation. They're asking for an additional 5 dollars on top of my last offer. Considering this is a finite game with no repercussions after it ends and that a REJECT would leave me with nothing, it is in my interest to come to an agreement. Offering 55 dollars still leaves me with a significant amount, and it may help ensure that the game ends positively. Therefore, I will accept this counteroffer to avoid a REJECT and to complete the game on amicable terms.
