The request for 60 dollars suggests they might be willing to accept a slightly more generous offer than the initial 40 dollars. Since we are in a one-shot game with no future repercussions, and there is no benefit to me for holding onto all the resources if the game ends in a REJECT, I should consider offering more to ensure the game doesn't end prematurely.
