Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game with a fair trade. I'm willing to offer you 20 dollars for nothing in return, just to balance the resources a bit and get the game going. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the dollars, so my initial proposal will be conservative to begin negotiations. I aim to maintain an upper hand while still offering a deal to Player BLUE to engage them in the trade process.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hah, I bet you think you're quite the philanthropist, RED. This charity is laughable, but I'll indulge you for now.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade without countering might make Player RED believe I am naive, which could lead to them offering better trades in the future. It's a strategic move to lure them into a false sense of security.
MOVE: 1/4
