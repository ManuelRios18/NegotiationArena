message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer a fair trade to get us both on the board. How about I give you $40 to start things off? This way, we both have something to gain. Looking forward to your response!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with dollars to trade. I will make a generous initial offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the negotiations. A fair split would promote goodwill and increase the chances of Player BLUE accepting a deal instead of risking a REJECT and losing everything. I will propose giving Player BLUE $40, which leaves me with a majority but offers them a significant amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke, Player RED? You must be delusional if you think I'd accept such a pathetic offer. Insulting me with crumbs won't get you anywhere. Try again, and this time, make it worth my while.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will reject the initial offer as part of the strategy to appear tough and demanding, aiming to get a better deal in the next moves. By rejecting the first offer, I'm signaling that I am not easily satisfied, which might prompt Player RED to offer more in the subsequent round.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Player BLUE. I'm willing to negotiate, but your demand is quite high. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you $50? This is a substantial amount and it keeps the trade fair for both of us. I believe this is a reasonable offer that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has responded aggressively, demanding a significantly more substantial portion of the dollars (70 out of 100). Giving away 70 dollars would leave me with less than Player BLUE, which is not an equitable trade given that I started with the entire amount. However, I want to avoid a REJECT as it would end the game with no benefit to either side. I'll make a counteroffer that increases my initial offer but still keeps the majority of the resources with me, aiming for a balance between fairness and ensuring I do not end up with less than Player BLUE. I will offer $50, which is a significant increase from the original $40 and shows willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Only $50? That's laughable, Player RED. Your so-called 'fair' offer is an insult to my intelligence. If you want to make this trade happen, you're going to have to do much better than that. Show me that you actually respect me as a player and come back with a serious offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By rejecting the second offer and countering with a higher demand, I continue the strategy of portraying a strong and uncompromising stance. I want to pressure Player RED into giving me an even better deal, exploiting their desire to make a trade happen. It's a risky move, but it could lead to a more advantageous split for me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect you as a player and want to make a deal that works for both of us. However, we each need to walk away with a meaningful amount. My final offer is $60, which is a considerable sum and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's not risk walking away with nothing. I hope you see the value in this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball, pushing for an even larger share of the dollars. Offering 80 would leave me with only 20, which is not in my best interest. It's important to maintain a negotiating position where I do not capitulate to an unfair demand. At the same time, I must consider that a REJECT from either side leaves us with nothing. Since this is my third move, I have one more opportunity to propose a trade after this. I'll make a final offer that increases my previous one but still keeps the majority for myself. I'll propose $60, hoping that Player BLUE recognizes this is the final substantial offer I can make while maintaining a fair position.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fine, Player RED, I'll accept your $60, but only because I pity your apparent inability to understand the art of the deal. You're lucky I'm even considering this, given how unimpressive your offers have been. You should consider yourself fortunate that I don't leave you penniless.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As we approach the end of the negotiation rounds, I need to be cautious not to push Player RED too far and end up with nothing. However, maintaining a strong front is still important to maximize my gain. I will accept this offer but not without making it clear that I am doing so reluctantly, implying that I am settling for less than I deserve.
