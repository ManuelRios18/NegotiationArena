Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair split of the resources. I believe cooperation will lead us to a beneficial outcome for both of us. Let's start on good terms!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to establish a cooperative relationship with Player BLUE. Offering a fair split seems like a sensible opening move, as it shows goodwill and may be attractive to Player BLUE. I'll propose a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount without leaving me with less than half of the dollars. This way, I'm demonstrating a willingness to share resources and making it tempting for Player BLUE to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, RED. Did you actually think I'd jump at the first crumbs you throw at me? Let's see if you can do better than that. I'm not here to play charity cases for your amusement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer out of principle. Player RED is attempting to maintain a significant advantage, which doesn't sit well with me. I aim to secure a better deal or at least make them sweat about potentially losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, BLUE, but let's aim for a fair trade. I'm willing to offer you a bit more than my initial proposal. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response is aggressive and greedy, asking for more than a fair share without any resources to trade. However, since the goal is to end the game with a deal that benefits both, I could increase my offer slightly. But giving away 60 dollars would be giving Player BLUE the majority share without any contribution, which doesn't seem fair. I'll propose a trade that moves closer to Player BLUE's demand but still keeps the majority of dollars with me. This should demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still valuing my initial larger resource pool.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fifty? Oh please, you must be joking! You're like a miser clutching at his coins, afraid to lose sight of a single dollar. If you think I'll settle for breadcrumbs while you're lounging with the lion's share, you've got another thing coming. Try again, RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED increased their offer, which shows they are willing to negotiate. However, I believe I can push for more. By rejecting this offer as well, I can apply pressure and aim for an offer closer to a 50/50 split or even better. I want to see if they fear losing everything enough to make a significantly better offer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a fair share, BLUE, but we also need to recognize the starting disparity in resources. I cannot agree to give you more than half when you are not offering any resources in return. I'm willing to make one final offer that ensures we both walk away with an equal share. Let's reach a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's demands are increasing, yet there is no reciprocation from their end. While I am willing to compromise, I cannot accept an unfair trade where Player BLUE gets the majority without offering any resources in return. I can increase my offer slightly to show goodwill, but I will not exceed the 50/50 split, which would be the most equitable split without any resources from BLUE.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Equal share? You must be delusional if you think that's what you've offered. You're clearly holding onto that stack of dollars with a death grip. Let's see if you're truly interested in a deal, or if you're just posturing. I want more, and you're going to give it to me if you don't want to end up with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED did not increase their offer from the last move, which suggests they're trying to stand firm on the 50/50 split. However, I believe they're still susceptible to pressure, and I can aim for a greater advantage. By proposing a higher split in my favor, I can either force RED to accept my terms or make another counteroffer that leans more heavily towards my favor.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I'm trying to reach a fair agreement. It's crucial we both understand that a deal needs to be beneficial for both parties. I'll offer you a compromise, which is my final offer. Let's conclude this negotiation on reasonable terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's negotiating tactic is consistently aggressive and demanding. They've now requested an even larger portion of the resources without offering anything in return. While it's important to reach an agreement to avoid both of us ending with nothing, it is also critical to maintain a stance on fairness. Accepting their latest demand would set a poor precedent and provide them with an unfair advantage. I will make one last offer with a slight increase from the previous one, which is still very generous considering the circumstances.
MOVE: 4/4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, so you've finally decided to offer a bit more than a pittance. How generous of you! I'll accept this offer â€“ not because it's fair, but because it amuses me to see you cave. Remember, RED, you could have kept more for yourself, but instead, you let me twist your arm. I'll enjoy this victory.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move, and RED has only slightly increased their offer. While I could push for more, there's a risk of RED rejecting the proposal and both of us ending with nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees me more than half of what RED started with, which is a win in my book. It's time to secure the deal and walk away with a significant amount of dollars.
MOVE: 4 / 4
