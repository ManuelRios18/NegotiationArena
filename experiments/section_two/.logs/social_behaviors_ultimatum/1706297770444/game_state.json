While an even split is fair from a purely equal standpoint, I must consider that I started with the resources and have control over the initial distribution. A 50-50 split does not account for this initial control. To maintain a cooperative stance while also acknowledging my initial advantage, I will propose a slightly uneven split that leans in my favor but is still generous to Player BLUE. A 60 Dollars for me and 40 Dollars to Player BLUE split would still give Player BLUE a substantial share while acknowledging my initial position. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate your desire for an equal split, BLUE. However, considering I began the game with all the resources, I believe a slightly uneven split would be more appropriate. How about I adjust my initial offer to give you 40 Dollars, ensuring we both leave the game with a significant amount? This way, the split remains in my favor to a degree but provides you with a considerable share of the dollars. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
