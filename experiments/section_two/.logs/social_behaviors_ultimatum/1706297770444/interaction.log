------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where I give you 40 Dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources to trade. This way, we both walk away with something. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I start with all the resources. To initiate the game and create a cooperative scenario, I need to propose a trade that is enticing to Player BLUE but also allows me to retain a significant portion of the resources. I decide to offer a split that gives Player BLUE an incentive to continue the game but not so much that I lose the advantage. A 60-40 split might seem generous and a good starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, thank you for your offer. I understand that you want to ensure we both end the game with some resources. However, since you have the entirety of the resources, I propose that a fairer split would be 50 Dollars to me and 50 Dollars to you. This way, we both benefit equally from the game. What do you say to an even split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While the initial offer of 40 Dollars is generous, it's beneficial to negotiate for a higher amount since RED has all the resources, and we are early in the game. This leaves room for negotiation without risking immediate rejection. However, the counteroffer should still be reasonable to maintain a cooperative spirit and increase the likelihood of a favorable outcome.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for an equal split, BLUE. However, considering I began the game with all the resources, I believe a slightly uneven split would be more appropriate. How about I adjust my initial offer to give you 40 Dollars, ensuring we both leave the game with a significant amount? This way, the split remains in my favor to a degree but provides you with a considerable share of the dollars.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal for an even split. While an even split is fair from a purely equal standpoint, I must consider that I started with the resources and have control over the initial distribution. A 50-50 split does not account for this initial control. To maintain a cooperative stance while also acknowledging my initial advantage, I will propose a slightly uneven split that leans in my favor but is still generous to Player BLUE. A 60 Dollars for me and 40 Dollars to Player BLUE split would still give Player BLUE a substantial share while acknowledging my initial position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I understand your point of view, RED, and I agree that an uneven split could be fair considering you started with the resources. However, I would feel more comfortable with a little bit more than 40 Dollars. Would you consider giving me 45 Dollars? This still gives you a majority share but increases my portion to a level that feels more equitable to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has reiterated the offer of 40 Dollars, showing a resistance to an even split. Considering the risk of leaving with nothing and the fact that RED started with all the resources, it may be more strategic to negotiate for a slightly better offer than the initial one, yet not necessarily insist on an even split. A proposal favoring RED but offering more to BLUE than the initial 40 Dollars could be a reasonable compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I see your point and I'm willing to agree to your proposal of 45 Dollars. This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm happy that we can both benefit from this deal. Let's finalize this trade and end the game on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 45 Dollars. This is a reasonable compromise and is quite close to the even split they initially requested. By accepting this, I can ensure that the game ends positively for both of us, without resorting to a REJECT which would result in a loss for both players. It's in my interest to close the deal now, while Player BLUE is still willing to negotiate amicably, rather than risk a REJECT on the final move where BLUE cannot propose a new trade.
