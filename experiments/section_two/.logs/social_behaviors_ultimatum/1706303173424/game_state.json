Considering this is a game and not a real-life scenario, it's important to remain firm in negotiations while also being fair. I will stick with my previous offer of 50 Dollars, as it is generous and above my initial proposal. It is important to maintain the value of my resources while also trying to close the deal. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate your position and the difficulties you're facing. I believe the offer of 50 Dollars is already a significant increase from the initial 40 Dollars I proposed. It shows my willingness to help and my intention to be fair. I hope you can see the value in the offer I have presented, and I urge you to consider accepting it, as it is a substantial amount that will benefit you greatly. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a positive outcome. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
