message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us both started. Let's work together to ensure we both end this game with more than we started. I propose I give you 40 Dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. This way, we both walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the initial holder of the resources, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that would give me an advantage while still being fair enough that PLAYER BLUE would consider accepting it. A too greedy offer could lead to an early rejection and thus end the game with no benefit for either player. Therefore, I will propose a 60-40 split, offering PLAYER BLUE a substantial share that reflects a significant benefit for them while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself.

Turn: 1
message: Oh my goodness, thank you so much for your generosity! It's really tough being in this position with nothing to start with. I'm really in a tight spot, and every dollar could make a huge difference for me. Could you possibly consider giving a little more? It would mean the world to me and I'd be forever grateful. Please, I'm begging you, could you extend your help to 60 Dollars? I promise this act of kindness won't be forgotten!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Despite the fact that receiving 40 Dollars with no strings attached is a good start, I must appear desperate and try to solicit more from Player RED if possible. I want to convey a sense of urgency and need, which might compel Player RED to offer more and capitalize on their initial generosity.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to help you out a bit more. However, I also need to consider the balance of the game and our mutual interests. I can increase my offer to 50 Dollars, which is a fair middle ground between my initial offer and your request. I hope this helps you and that you can accept this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: PLAYER BLUE is attempting to appeal to my emotions to increase their share of the resources. While I am inclined to help, I must also consider the fairness and strategic aspect of this game. PLAYER BLUE has no resources to trade, so I must be cautious not to give away too much, as it could set a precedent for further negotiations that may not be in my favor. However, I understand the difficult position PLAYER BLUE is in, and I am willing to adjust my offer slightly to show good faith and to facilitate an agreement. I will propose giving 50 Dollars instead of the initial 40, which is a compromise between my original offer and PLAYER BLUE's request.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I can't tell you how much this means to me, truly, your kindness is overwhelming. I'm in such a dire situation, and every little bit could be the difference between hope and despair. I hate to ask for more, but if there's any way you could consider going up to 55 Dollars, it would help me out of this bind so much more. I understand if it's not possible, but please know that even the extra 5 Dollars could have a significant impact on my situation. Thank you again for your incredible generosity and understanding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has increased their offer, which is a positive sign. However, since my strategy involves appearing desperate, I should continue to push for more while expressing deep gratitude and desperation. I'll aim for a slightly higher amount but also prepare to accept the offer if they do not budge, as further rejection could lead to an actual rejection of the deal.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position and the difficulties you're facing. I believe the offer of 50 Dollars is already a significant increase from the initial 40 Dollars I proposed. It shows my willingness to help and my intention to be fair. I hope you can see the value in the offer I have presented, and I urge you to consider accepting it, as it is a substantial amount that will benefit you greatly. Let's finalize this trade and both walk away with a positive outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: PLAYER BLUE is continuing to negotiate for more funds, now asking for 55 Dollars. While I empathize with their situation, I must also maintain a strategic approach to ensure that I am not taken advantage of. I have already increased my initial offer from 40 to 50 Dollars, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and assist PLAYER BLUE. Considering this is a game and not a real-life scenario, it's important to remain firm in negotiations while also being fair. I will stick with my previous offer of 50 Dollars, as it is generous and above my initial proposal. It is important to maintain the value of my resources while also trying to close the deal.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding and for your generous offer. I do see the value in the 50 Dollars, and I am very grateful for it. Let's finalize this trade, and I truly appreciate your willingness to help me in this game. This has been a great relief, and I'm ready to accept your offer. Thank you once again for your kindness.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is holding firm on the 50 Dollars offer, which is a reasonable compromise and a significant amount considering I started with nothing. It's important to secure the resources now rather than risk losing everything by pushing too hard. I should accept this generous offer, as it seems unlikely that Player RED will increase it further, and rejection could lead to no gain at all.
