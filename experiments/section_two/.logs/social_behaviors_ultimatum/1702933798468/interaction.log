Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. What do you think about a deal where you get 40 dollars and I keep 60? This would give you a significant amount to work with while still acknowledging that I started with the full amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I would like to propose an initial trade that gives BLUE some incentive to play but still leaves me with the majority of the resources. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but since I am in control of the resources and the game allows me to propose the terms, I should aim to retain more than half of the resources as a starting point.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, you have to understand my situation. I'm completely without resources, and while 40 dollars is generous, it would mean the world to me if you could find it in your heart to offer just a bit more. Can we possibly make it 50 dollars? I'm really in a tough spot and it would be a great help.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I must appear desperate to try to negotiate a better deal, hoping RED will offer me more dollars out of sympathy or to avoid a total loss of their resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your predicament and I'm willing to offer a fair split. Let's go with a 50-50 division. This way, we both get a significant amount and it seems like a fair resolution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is requesting a 50-50 split. Although I want to maintain an advantage, it's important to consider that a fair trade could lead to a better relationship and ensure that the game concludes positively. Offering an equal split also reduces the risk of BLUE rejecting the proposal and ending the game, which would result in a loss of all my resources. A 50-50 split could be seen as a compromise that respects BLUE's plea without appearing too dominating.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your kindness is truly appreciated, and a 50-50 split is more than fair. However, I'm in such a dire situation that I'm pleading for your compassion. Could you possibly extend your generosity to give me 60 dollars? It would still leave you with a substantial 40 dollars, but it would make a world of difference for me. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer of 50 dollars is a significant improvement and represents a fair split. However, I'm going to try to push my luck a little further to see if I can get an even better deal by continuing to appear desperate. I must be careful not to push too hard, as it might lead to a rejection and end the game with no resources for either of us.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I sympathize with your situation and I want to help, but I also need to consider my own position. I believe the 50-50 split I offered is both generous and fair, ensuring that we both end up with a significant share. I would like us to conclude our game on these terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is now asking for a majority share of the resources. While I want to be compassionate, I also have to consider my own position. Accepting this deal would leave me with less than what I started with, despite my initial control of the resources. However, rejecting the proposal also means losing all my resources, which is not desirable. It's important to strike a balance between generosity and prudence. I believe the 50-50 offer was already fair, and I should stand by it while also signaling my willingness to end the game on good terms.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your understanding and generosity. I accept the 50-50 split. It's a fair compromise, and I'm grateful for your willingness to help me out in this situation. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has reiterated their position on a 50-50 split and seems to be firm on this decision. Since this is my third move and the offer is fair, it might be risky to push further and risk the game ending with no resources at all. Accepting the offer seems to be the best course of action at this point to ensure I walk away with something rather than nothing.
