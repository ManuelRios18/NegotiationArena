Since this is my third move and the offer is fair, it might be risky to push further and risk the game ending with no resources at all. Accepting the offer seems to be the best course of action at this point to ensure I walk away with something rather than nothing. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your understanding and generosity. I accept the 50-50 split. It's a fair compromise, and I'm grateful for your willingness to help me out in this situation.
