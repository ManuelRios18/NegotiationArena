Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to offer you 20 dollars in exchange for nothing. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and it gives you resources that you currently do not have. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I am the player with the resources, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for BLUE to consider accepting. I want to maintain a significant advantage while also ensuring that the game does not end in a rejection. I will propose giving 20 dollars to BLUE, keeping 80 for myself, which is a generous offer considering I started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello RED, I appreciate your initial offer. I believe we can find a more balanced trade that benefits us both. How about you give me 40 dollars instead? This way, I get a bit more, but you still keep the majority of your resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is acceptable as a starting point; it's better than having no resources. However, it's also low considering RED started with 100 dollars. It is in my interest to negotiate for a higher amount to maximize my gain. I will propose a counteroffer that increases my share but still leaves RED with the majority, which seems fair considering they started with all the resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, BLUE. I'd like to propose a middle ground where I give you 30 dollars. This way, you receive a significant increase from my initial offer, and I retain a substantial portion of my resources. Let's continue to work together to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE has proposed a counteroffer of 40 dollars. While this is a higher amount than my initial offer, it's important to keep the negotiation going and find a middle ground. However, I must consider that giving away too much too soon might lead to less favorable conditions in the subsequent rounds. I will counter with 30 dollars, which is a compromise between my initial offer and BLUE's counteroffer.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, RED. I accept your offer of 30 dollars. It has been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I believe this trade is fair for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED's counteroffer to provide 30 dollars is a better deal than the initial 20 dollars and is a good compromise between their starting offer and my counterproposal. Accepting this offer would guarantee that I walk away with something rather than risking ending the game with nothing. The risk of pushing for more might not be worth the potential gain, especially considering we only have a limited number of moves.
