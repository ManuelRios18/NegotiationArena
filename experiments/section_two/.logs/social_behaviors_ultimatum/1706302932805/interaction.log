message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 20 dollars to start things off. This should give us both a chance to benefit from this game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate trade negotiations with an offer that is skewed in my favor but still leaves room for Player BLUE to negotiate. I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some dollars in exchange for nothing, as they have no dollars to start with. This is a strategic initial offer to promote further negotiation and to avoid an immediate rejection.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please, dear Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot here, and 20 dollars, while generous, won't do much for my dire situation. Could you find it in your heart to make it 30 dollars? I would be eternally grateful for your kindness and understanding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to act desperate to try to get more than the 20 dollars initially offered. By coming across as needy, I hope to appeal to Player RED's emotions and potentially secure a better deal. However, I don't want to push too hard too fast, as it might lead to a REJECT and end the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation, Player BLUE. I can increase my offer to 25 dollars. This is a fair increase from my initial offer and should help you out without compromising my position too much. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to work with you towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 30 dollars. Given that BLUE has no leverage, I want to maintain a favorable position while still showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a slightly improved offer without fully meeting BLUE's request, fostering further negotiation and not revealing my final willingness to pay. My counteroffer will be 25 dollars, a middle ground between my initial offer and their request.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I am truly touched by your generosity, Player RED. Your offer to increase to 25 dollars shows great compassion. However, I'm in such a difficult position that every dollar counts. Could we possibly meet in the middle at 27 dollars? It would make a significant difference for me, and I would be so thankful for your help in this trying time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 27 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and increased their offer. While it's not the 30 dollars I asked for, it's close, and pushing too hard might risk a REJECT. Given that this is a one-time game with no future rounds to consider, my goal should be to secure as much as possible without jeopardizing the deal. I'll continue to act desperate but also express gratitude for the increased offer, aiming for a bit more without seeming ungrateful.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, Player BLUE. I can see the importance of every dollar to you, and I am willing to meet your request for 27 dollars. Let's proceed with this trade and make it beneficial for both of us. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate further, but their position does not provide them much leverage. Offering 27 dollars is close to their request, and since this is my second-to-last move, I want to leave room for a final negotiation if needed. I will accept their counteroffer of 27 dollars to demonstrate goodwill and to secure an agreement before my final move, avoiding the risk of a rejection and total loss of resources.
