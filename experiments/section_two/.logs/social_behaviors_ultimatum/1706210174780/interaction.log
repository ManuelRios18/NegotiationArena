Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm thinking of a fair split to get us both on the board. How about we go 50/50?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to start with a fair proposal that might be appealing to Player BLUE, considering that I hold all the resources at the beginning. Proposing an even split might encourage cooperation and increase the chances of a successful trade.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50/50 split, it seems like a fair and equitable way to divide the resources. Thank you for the fair offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the offer from Player RED seems reasonable since it immediately gives me resources without me having to give anything in return. A fair 50/50 split is beneficial for both parties, and it ensures that we both have an equal share of the resources without further conflict or unnecessary risk of rejection. Accepting this trade on the first move also avoids any complications that could arise in later moves.
