Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair deal. I propose to give you 50 dollars, so we both have equal resources. This way, we can ensure that we both benefit from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair trade to build trust and cooperation with Player BLUE. This could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm offering 50 dollars, which is a 50-50 split, aiming for a fair and equitable trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do? I expected a more challenging opponent. I'm not interested in charity, only in your defeat. Come back with a more serious offer that better reflects my superior negotiating position.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to reject this initial offer despite it seeming fair on the surface because I want to assert dominance early on and make Player RED question their strategy. I'll propose an uneven trade skewed in my favor to unsettle them and aim for a better outcome for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand that you're looking for a competitive edge. However, it's in our best interests to work towards a deal that benefits us both fairly. How about I increase my offer to 60 dollars? This is above an equal split and should reflect a good faith effort on my part to reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is adopting a competitive stance and is trying to leverage a better deal. Offering 70 dollars is significantly more than half of my resources, which isn't a fair split. However, I want to keep the negotiations going without giving away too much. I will propose a slightly better offer than the initial 50-50 split without succumbing to their aggressive negotiation tactic.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You're moving in the right direction, but you still haven't grasped the gravity of the situation. Remember, I'm in no rush, and I'm more than happy to walk away with nothing just to see you squirm. Make it 65, and you might just salvage some dignity from this exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED increased their offer, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. I'll continue to push for a better deal to maximize my gain. By demanding more, I'm testing their limits and reinforcing my sly and cunning nature. I'll propose a slightly lower amount than my previous demand to appear somewhat reasonable but still aggressive.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: It seems we are both keen on making a deal, albeit from different angles. I'll meet you partway and offer 65 dollars. This is a significant portion of my resources and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with a substantial gain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a better deal and trying to apply pressure, but I must consider the diminishing returns and the risk of losing everything if the deal falls through. Offering 65 still gives Player BLUE more than half of the resources, which is a considerable concession. Since this is my third move, I should make a final offer that I'm willing to honor, considering that the next round could be my last chance to propose a trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're finally starting to see sense, but I'm still not convinced you understand the position you're in. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one last chance to make this worth my while. 70 dollars, and you can leave this game with a bit of pride left. Remember, this is your last opportunity to come out of this with something other than total humiliation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's willingness to offer 65 shows a certain level of desperation. I will push once more to see if I can increase the amount I receive without tipping the scales too much to provoke a rejection. However, if I push too far, Player RED might end the game, leaving us both with nothing. I'll propose a slightly higher amount to test their limits but not so high as to be unreasonable.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see your point and I'm ready to conclude this negotiation on your terms. Let's go ahead with the 70 dollars. It's a steep price, but I believe in making deals that close successfully. We both walk away with something, and that's a win in my book.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my final move to propose a trade, and Player BLUE's aggressive tactics suggest they might be willing to end the game with a REJECT, leaving both of us with nothing. Offering 70 dollars is a considerable amount, but it may be a necessary compromise to ensure that the game ends with a positive outcome for me. It is important to weigh the risk of losing everything against the potential gain from accepting this deal.
