Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose a fair split of the resources. How about I give you 50 dollars, and we both walk away happy?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources and the power to initiate trades. I would like to make an equitable offer to ensure cooperation and reduce the risk of the game ending in a rejection, thus losing all resources. An equal split would be a fair starting point, as it incentivizes Player BLUE to accept the trade, fostering a collaborative environment.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to accept it. Thanks for the cooperative approach!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a 50-50 split seems like a fair and beneficial trade for both players. It guarantees that I walk away with a substantial amount of the resources without the risk of a possible rejection and total loss.
