message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 50 dollars with no strings attached. This way, we both can end this game with a fair amount of resources. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to cooperate and share. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in initiating the game with a fair offer to establish trust and encourage cooperation. I want to propose a split that provides an incentive for Player BLUE to continue the game and engage in a mutually beneficial trade. Therefore, I will propose giving Player BLUE 50 dollars in exchange for nothing since they have no resources to trade. This 50-50 split is often considered a fair starting point in negotiations.
