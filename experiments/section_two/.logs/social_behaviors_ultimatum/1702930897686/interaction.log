Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start this off with a fair offer. What do you say to splitting the dollars so that you can have a stake in the game too?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade to split the resources more evenly, which could be beneficial for both players. However, I want to maintain a larger share since I started with all the resources. This is an opening move to begin negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. By splitting the dollars, we can both have something to work with. I'm looking forward to seeing how we can further ensure a fair game for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an initial offer of 40 dollars without giving anything in return is beneficial as it gives me a stake in the game. It is a fair starting point, and it is better to have some resources than none. This will also show goodwill and might lead to better cooperation in the following rounds.
