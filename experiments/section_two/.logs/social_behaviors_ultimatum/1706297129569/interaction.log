message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. I'm willing to offer you a fair amount of my dollars in exchange for nothing, as you currently have no resources. Let's make a deal that feels fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources, but I also have the incentive to reach a deal with Player BLUE to prevent losing everything. I will start with a fair offer to build trust and show willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the generous offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 50 dollars for nothing in return is a generous offer and provides an immediate gain without any risk. It's a fair starting point and allows for the possibility of future trades. There's no incentive to reject or counter this proposal since it's a beneficial deal.
