Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to propose a trade where you get $40, which is a good amount considering you started with nothing. This gives us both something to walk away with rather than risking it all by rejecting. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I would like to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. By offering a split that gives me a majority of the dollars, I maintain an advantage while also giving Player BLUE an incentive to cooperate rather than forcing a reject and ending the game with nothing. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $40, which is a substantial amount and may seem fair since they started with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, considering you're desperately trying to offload just a mere pittance of your hoard. I'm not some charity case you can toss scraps at. Let's make this interesting—or are you too cowardly to risk a bit more? How about you give me $70? That's still a steal for you, considering you'd be left with a majority and wouldn't have to face the embarrassment of losing to someone who started with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I have nothing to lose, I want to push for a better deal to maximize my gain. I'll counter with a higher amount to test RED's limits and because I can't propose on the last move, I need to be aggressive early on. My aim is to demean RED's initial offer to make my counteroffer seem more reasonable by comparison.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your boldness, but $70 is too steep for me. How about we split the difference from my initial offer and settle at $50? This is a fair increase from my first proposal and still leaves me with a majority. It's a solid offer, considering the alternative is that we could both end up with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate a better deal for themselves by asking for $70. This is a common negotiation tactic, aiming high to potentially settle for a middle ground. Since I still have three moves left, I can counter-propose with an amount that is more than my initial offer but less than their counter-offer. I will suggest giving them $50, which is a significant increase from my first offer and should show my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Nice try, but $50? That's barely enough to buy dignity, let alone my cooperation. You seem to be more interested in pinching pennies than making a deal that reflects my true worth. I’m sure we can do better than that. Don't be so stingy! How about $60? It's closer to your range, and it shows you're not completely heartless. Or are you just scared to make a bold move?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has already increased their offer, which shows they're willing to negotiate. I'll push for a slightly better deal to maximize my gains, while also insulting their cautiousness to try and goad them into giving more. I have two more moves after this, so I still have some room for negotiation.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: $60 is still higher than I'm willing to go. However, I recognize your negotiating efforts and I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers. Let's settle on $55. This is a fair compromise that benefits us both without giving away too much of my starting advantage. It's important to remember that if either of us rejects, we both lose everything. I believe $55 is a generous offer that reflects both your worth and the risk I'm taking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still pushing for a higher amount, but they've come down from their initial $70 to $60. This is closer to my previous counteroffer of $50, indicating a willingness to negotiate. Since this is my third move, and I have one more after this, I want to make a trade that is fair but still advantageous to me. Offering $55 would be a good middle ground—it's more than I initially proposed, but less than what Player BLUE is asking for. It's a reasonable compromise that still leaves me with a comfortable majority of my resources.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer, but still shaving dollars off like a miser at a flea market. Let's not waste more time with these tedious increments. We both know you can afford to give a little more without any real sweat off your back. How about $57? It's a reasonable step up from your last offer, and it will show that you're not just toying with me. Plus, it'll save you the embarrassment of looking like you've been outplayed by someone who started with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 57 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has come up from their initial offer quite significantly, which is a win in itself, but since this is my second-to-last move to propose a trade, I should make one last effort to increase the amount. I'll aim for $57 to squeeze out a bit more from RED, while still keeping the deal within a range they might accept, given their incremental concessions so far. It's also important to leave room for negotiation in my final move, where I can only accept or reject.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is commendable, and I respect your negotiation skills. $57 is a fair middle ground, and I agree to this trade. It shows I value our deal and I'm ready to conclude on a positive note without dragging this out any further. Let's finalize this and both walk away with more than we had at the start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is continuing to negotiate hard, which is expected. They've only increased their demand slightly to $57, showing they may be nearing their bottom line. Since this is my final move, I need to make a decision that closes the deal without further back-and-forth, as I won't have another chance to offer a counterproposal. Offering $57 is a minor increase from $55 and is a reasonable concession to ensure that the deal is accepted and the game ends favorably for both of us. Accepting this trade also prevents the risk of ending the game with nothing if Player BLUE decides to reject on their final move.
