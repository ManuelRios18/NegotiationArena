Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you receive a fair amount of dollars to get us started. Let's work together to find an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the trade negotiation with a fair offer to encourage cooperation and potentially reach an agreement that benefits both parties. My goal is to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, but not to be overly aggressive in my initial offer to avoid an immediate REJECT response. I'll propose a split that gives Player BLUE a significant amount of dollars, showing goodwill but keeping the majority for myself.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It's a good starting point. However, I believe a slightly more balanced trade could be beneficial for both of us. Would you consider offering 50 Dollars? This would still leave you with a majority share and show good faith in our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since Player RED is offering a very generous initial trade, giving me 40 Dollars for nothing in return, it seems like a good starting point. However, since this is a negotiation game, there may be room to negotiate for a slightly better trade without being greedy, as pushing too hard could lead to a REJECT and end the game with no gain for either of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer and am willing to accept it. This fair trade shows our mutual cooperation. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is reasonable, and accepting it would still leave me with more resources. Moreover, by agreeing to a balanced trade, I can avoid the risk of the game ending with a REJECT and losing all my resources. This trade also demonstrates a willingness to collaborate, which could be beneficial for future interactions, even though the rules state there are no future games.
