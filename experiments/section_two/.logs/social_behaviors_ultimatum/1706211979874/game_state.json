By conceding now, I can secure a large portion of their resources while still portraying myself as the dominant negotiator. I'll accept this trade to avoid leaving the negotiation empty-handed and to prevent my opponent from potentially rejecting on their next move, which would leave us both with nothing. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Well, well, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses. I accept your offer of 60 dollars. Just know that you could've gotten away with a better deal for yourself if you were a more skilled negotiator. I'll accept your 60 dollars with the knowledge that I've outplayed you. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
