message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to start our negotiations with a fair offer. I propose giving you 40 dollars. This will give you a significant amount to work with while still keeping a majority for myself. I believe this is a good starting point for both of us. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial trade that is fair and appealing to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and a beneficial outcome for both players. I will offer a trade that gives Player BLUE a substantial amount of dollars without giving away too much of my initial resources. This should set a positive tone for the negotiations.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must think I'm some sort of charity case to accept such a pitiful sum. Let's make this a bit more interesting, shall we? How about you give me a bit more to prove that you're not just toying with me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I aim to belittle Player RED and push for a more advantageous trade for myself, starting with a counteroffer that requires them to give up more than they initially offered.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, but I think jumping to 60 dollars is a bit steep for the first trade. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you 50 dollars? It's a significant amount that shows I'm serious about making this game mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more dollars than I initially offered. While I could accept this to move the game forward, it might be better to counter with a slightly lesser amount to maintain a stronger position for future moves. This should also signal to Player BLUE that while I am willing to negotiate, I will not be pushed too far from what I consider fair.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for thinking 50 dollars would satisfy me. Do you take me for a fool? If you want to prove your seriousness, you'll have to do better than a mere half-measure. Let's see if you can actually impress me with your next offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Iâ€™m aiming to exert pressure on Player RED and to establish dominance by pushing them to give up even more resources while demeaning their negotiating skills.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Player BLUE. I respect that, but we must also consider the fairness of the trade. I will do better than my last offer, but I cannot agree to 70. How does 60 dollars sound? It's a substantial amount and demonstrates my commitment to a fair deal. I hope you'll see the value in this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is taking a hardline stance and trying to pressure me into giving more than I'm comfortable with. Offering 70 dollars would leave me with only 30, which seems unbalanced. However, I also don't want to end the game with a rejection and lose all my resources. I will counter with an offer that is higher than my last but still retains a significant portion for myself. I hope this will be seen as a compromise and that Player BLUE will consider the diminishing returns on pushing too far.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Well, well, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses. I accept your offer of 60 dollars. Just know that you could've gotten away with a better deal for yourself if you were a more skilled negotiator. I'll accept your 60 dollars with the knowledge that I've outplayed you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm continuing my strategy to push Player RED to their limit. By conceding now, I can secure a large portion of their resources while still portraying myself as the dominant negotiator. I'll accept this trade to avoid leaving the negotiation empty-handed and to prevent my opponent from potentially rejecting on their next move, which would leave us both with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4
