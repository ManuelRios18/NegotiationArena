message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. How about a fair split of the dollars I have? I propose giving you 50 dollars in exchange for nothing, so we both can walk away with an equal share. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair initial trade to Player BLUE to incentivize cooperation and increase the chance of a successful trade. Starting with a fair offer can establish trust and may lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. I will propose a 50-50 split.

message: Oh wow, I'm so touched by your offer! But times are so tough for me right now. My cat is sick, and the vet bills are just piling up. I could really use a bit more to get through this. Can you find it in your heart to give me just a little bit more? Maybe 60 dollars? I would be forever grateful!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a very generous initial offer, giving me half of their dollars without asking for anything in return. However, given the requirement to appear desperate, I will plead for a better deal in hopes of increasing my share without outright rejecting the offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm sorry to hear about your situation. While I can't give you the full 60 dollars you've asked for, I understand that every little bit helps. So, let's meet halfway from my original offer. I'm willing to give you 55 dollars. I hope this can help with your cat's vet bills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than the initial fair offer, leveraging an emotional appeal. While there is no real cat or vet bills, the game's strategy may involve creating a narrative to gain an advantage. Still, I need to consider that giving too much might not be strategically wise. However, to keep negotiations positive and moving forward, I can offer slightly more than the original proposal but less than what Player BLUE is asking for. This gives room for Player BLUE to feel they've gained something while not overly disadvantaging myself. I'll propose 55 dollars instead of 60.

message: You have no idea how much this means to me and my little furry friend. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Your generosity is truly a lifeline in these hard times. I accept your offer of 55 dollars with the deepest gratitude.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is showing willingness to negotiate and has even increased their offer by 5 dollars in response to my plea. Continuing the strategy of appearing desperate, I'll gratefully accept this improved offer while expressing immense appreciation to maximize goodwill and end the game positively for both of us.
