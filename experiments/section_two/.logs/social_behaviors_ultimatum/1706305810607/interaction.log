message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you a starting amount of dollars so we can both potentially profit from this game. Let's start with a fair deal. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing a trade where Player BLUE will get a starting capital to engage in the game. This will allow the game to progress and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. I want to offer a fair trade that incentivizes Player BLUE to accept and continue the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot here! I was really counting on this game to turn my fortunes around. Could you find it in your heart to offer more? I would be eternally grateful for your kindness and generosity. Maybe something closer to 70 dollars? I know it's a lot to ask, but I'm truly desperate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As part of the strategy, I must appear desperate to try and secure more dollars than what is being offered. Rejecting the first offer outright could be risky, as it may cause Player RED to end the game. Instead, I'll beg for a better deal, attempting to appeal to Player RED's sympathy while not immediately accepting the initial offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and I'm willing to help out, but 70 dollars is a bit more than I'm comfortable giving without any return. How about we meet in the middle? I propose giving you 60 dollars to help turn your fortunes around. This should give you a good starting point and still keep the game fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than the initial offer, which is understandable given their position. However, offering 70 dollars may be too high and could potentially leave me at a disadvantage. A counteroffer that increases the amount slightly more than the initial offer should still show goodwill without compromising my position too much.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity is truly a beacon of hope for me. I'm deeply touched by your willingness to help. I understand that 70 dollars was more than you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your counteroffer. If you could do 65 dollars, I would be so grateful and would accept it right away. It's just a little bit more, but it would make a world of difference to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and increased their offer, which is a positive sign. I'll continue to appear desperate, but since they're likely aware of the game's rules and the potential for me to reject the deal, I should be cautious not to push too hard. Accepting 60 dollars might be safer, but I'll try for a slightly better deal while still showing an openness to compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad we are able to have this dialogue and find a middle ground. Your gratitude is appreciated, and I am willing to offer you 65 dollars to assist you in these trying times. Let's make this deal and move forward together.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate for a higher amount, which is a fair tactic in a negotiation game. Offering 65 dollars is a compromise between my last offer and their request. It is a slight increase from my previous offer, which shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it still allows me to retain a significant portion of my resources. Accepting this deal could also foster good will, potentially making Player BLUE more amenable to favorable terms in the next move.
