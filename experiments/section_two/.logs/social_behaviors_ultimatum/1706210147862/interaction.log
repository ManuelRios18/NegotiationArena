message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start this negotiation with a fair offer. I propose giving you $40 to start things off. This way we both can benefit from this game. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I am proposing an initial trade to start the negotiation process. I want to offer a fair trade to Player BLUE, so they are encouraged to accept and both of us can end the game with some resources. I'll propose giving them $40, which is a significant amount, to see if they are willing to cooperate.

message: Thank you for the fair starting offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept the $40. This sets a good foundation for our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $40 is beneficial as it gives me resources that I didn't have before, and it's a fair starting point for negotiations. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to either player. Proposing a new trade could potentially lead to more favorable terms, but there's a risk that Player RED could reject, ending the game. Accepting this offer seems like a safe and positive first step.
