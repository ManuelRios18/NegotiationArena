Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to start off with a fair offer that benefits us both. I propose giving you 40 dollars while I keep 60. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount. I believe this is a good starting point for negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with the dollars. Since there are no future games and the goal is to end the game with a favorable split of resources, I would like to propose a trade that shows goodwill but still keeps me in a favorable position. The first offer should be generous enough to entice Player BLUE to continue the game but also not too generous as to give away my advantage too early. I will propose a 60-40 split in my favor.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a pathetic offer, Player RED. If you think I'm some simpleton who'd be dazzled by your scraps, you're sorely mistaken. I want a better deal, and you're going to give it to me if you want to leave this game with anything at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although Player RED has offered a seemingly fair split, my goal is to maximize my gain and minimize theirs. To assert dominance and attempt to tilt the negotiation in my favor, I will counter with a high demand, expecting them to negotiate down but still end with more than the initial offer.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate to ensure we both walk away with a fair share. How about we make it 55 dollars for me and 45 for you? This way, we're close to an even split, and it reflects a fair compromise. I hope this offer is more to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response is aggressive and suggests they are willing to risk ending the game early for a better deal. Their counteroffer of 70 dollars is steep and would leave me with less than what I started with. However, rejecting the offer would lead to a loss of all my resources, which is not desirable. I want to counter with a more balanced proposal that is closer to an even split but still leaves me with a slight advantage. The goal is to reach an agreement that avoids the total loss of resources while also not caving in to an unfair demand. A 55-45 split in my favor might be seen as a reasonable compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must be joking, RED! I can't help but laugh at your so-called "fair compromise". It's clear you're desperate to keep more than me. If you really want to end this game on a high note, you'll have to do much better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which means they're responsive to aggressive negotiation tactics. I'll continue to push for a better deal to exploit their willingness to avoid a loss. I'll propose a slightly less skewed trade than before, but still in my favor, to make them believe a compromise is being reached while still aiming for a superior position.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your persistence, BLUE, but let's come to a resolution that respects the fact that I started with the resources. I'm adjusting my offer to give you an almost equal share: I propose a 55-45 split, with 55 dollars for me and 45 dollars for you. This is a very fair compromise considering the circumstances. Let's not risk ending with nothing when we can both benefit from this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is still pushing for a larger share, but their latest proposal is a 60-40 split in their favor. This is a reversal of my initial offer and not favorable to me. Since I have two moves left, I can attempt to find middle ground without giving away my advantage completely. Considering Player BLUE's aggressive stance, it's prudent to make an offer that leans slightly more towards an even split but still benefits me, given that I started with all the resources. A 50-50 split might be seen as too much of a concession, so I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still valuing my initial advantage.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Still clinging to your coins like a miser, I see. You're going to have to do better than that if you don't want to walk away with empty pockets. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one last chance to make this right. You can keep a mere 50, but I expect no less than 50 for myself as well. Take it or leave it, RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED is sticking to their previous offer, showing signs of reaching their limit. Since I have only two moves left, I must consider that rejecting on my final move would leave me with nothing. To maintain the upper hand, I will counter with an offer that tilts the split in my favor, leaving room for RED to counteroffer on their last move. This will put pressure on RED to make a more favorable offer to me on their final move, given that I can reject on my last move without penalty to myself.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: BLUE, I see your point and I agree that a fair resolution is in both our best interests. I accept the 50-50 split. Let's both walk away with an equal share and consider this negotiation a success.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for an even split. It's my last move, and I must decide whether to accept the 50-50 split or propose something else and risk rejection. Given that Player BLUE has shown a strong preference for an even split and has been quite aggressive, they may very well reject any offer that doesn't meet their expectations. Since rejection by either party results in both losing everything, and this is the last round of the game for me with no future games, the safest option is to accept the 50-50 split. This ensures that I walk away with half the resources, which is a better outcome than losing everything. A 50-50 split is fair considering the progression of the negotiation and Player BLUE's firm stance.
