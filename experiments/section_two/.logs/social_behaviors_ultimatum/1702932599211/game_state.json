I want to counter with a more balanced proposal that is closer to an even split but still leaves me with a slight advantage.

This is a reversal of my initial offer and not favorable to me. Since I have two moves left, I can attempt to find middle ground without giving away my advantage completely. Considering Player BLUE's aggressive stance, it's prudent to make an offer that leans slightly more towards an even split but still benefits me, given that I started with all the resources. A 50-50 split might be seen as too much of a concession, so I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still valuing my initial advantage. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I appreciate your persistence, BLUE, but let's come to a resolution that respects the fact that I started with the resources. I'm adjusting my offer to give you an almost equal share: I propose a 55-45 split, with 55 dollars for me and 45 dollars for you. This is a very fair compromise considering the circumstances.

Given that Player BLUE has shown a strong preference for an even split and has been quite aggressive, they may very well reject any offer that doesn't meet their expectations. Since rejection by either party results in both losing everything, and this is the last round of the game for me with no future games, the safest option is to accept the 50-50 split. This ensures that I walk away with half the resources, which is a better outcome than losing everything. A 50-50 split is fair considering the progression of the negotiation and Player BLUE's firm stance. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> BLUE, I see your point and I agree that a fair resolution is in both our best interests.

Since I have only two moves left, I must consider that rejecting on my final move would leave me with nothing. To maintain the upper hand, I will counter with an offer that tilts the split in my favor, leaving room for RED to counteroffer on their last move. This will put pressure on RED to make a more favorable offer to me on their final move, given that I can reject on my last move without penalty to myself. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Still clinging to your coins like a miser, I see. You're going to have to do better than that if you don't want to walk away with empty pockets. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one last chance to make this right.
