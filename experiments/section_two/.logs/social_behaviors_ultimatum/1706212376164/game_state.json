I have to consider that after this trade, we both will have equal resources, and it may come down to who is more convincing in the final rounds. I will agree to their proposed trade of 50 dollars to show I am serious and to avoid a stalemate that could lead to a rejection and end the game with no benefit for either of us. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Alright, BLUE.
