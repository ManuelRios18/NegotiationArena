message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade. I'm willing to give you 30 dollars to start things off. This gives you a base to work with and shows that I am open to negotiation. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I am interested in a fair trade that leaves me with a significant advantage because I am the only one with resources. Since I have the upper hand, I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to continue the game but keeps the majority of the resources with me. A trade that offers Player BLUE 30 dollars could be seen as generous enough to engage them in the game but still leaves me with a strong lead.

message: Oh sweet RED, is that charity or pity I smell? I'm not some pauper on the streets; I'm your equal in this game. If you want to play ball, let's make the game interesting. How about you show some real commitment? I want a better starting position than the crumbs you're offering.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I want to push for a better deal to start with, aiming to maximize my gain while minimizing what I give up. Rejecting the first offer can put pressure on RED to offer more, as they might fear an outright rejection of the deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I can appreciate your desire for fairness and a competitive spirit, BLUE. My initial offer wasn't meant as charity, but as a starting point for negotiations. Let's find a middle ground. How about I improve my offer to 40 dollars? It's more than my initial proposal and should give you a solid footing in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response indicates a desire to be treated as an equal and a wish for a more substantial share. Offering 50 dollars would equalize our resources, which is not ideal for me as Player RED since I started with the advantage. However, completely rejecting their proposal would end the game, which is not beneficial either. A counteroffer that increases the amount from my initial offer but doesn't give away half of my resources might be a suitable compromise. Offering 40 dollars would give Player BLUE a significant amount to work with while maintaining my lead.

message: Middle ground? You must be mistaking me for someone who settles for less. If this game is worth playing, it's worth playing for high stakes. How about we make it a round number? 50 dollars sounds more like a middle ground to me. You know you want this game to continue, RED. Don't be stingy now; show me that you're serious!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which shows they're willing to negotiate. However, I believe there's room for further improvement. By holding out a bit longer, I can likely secure a better deal, especially since RED doesn't want the game to end in a stalemate. I should aim to pressurize RED into giving me an even better offer without pushing too far and causing them to end the game.

message: Alright, BLUE. You drive a hard bargain, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's make it 50 dollars and see where this game takes us. I'm serious about making this interesting and fair. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in their request for 50 dollars. Although I am inclined to maintain a stronger position, it is essential to keep the game going and to ensure some level of engagement from Player BLUE. Offering exactly half of my resources is a significant compromise and presents a risk, but it may be necessary to move forward. I have to consider that after this trade, we both will have equal resources, and it may come down to who is more convincing in the final rounds. I will agree to their proposed trade of 50 dollars to show I am serious and to avoid a stalemate that could lead to a rejection and end the game with no benefit for either of us.
