While I can't accept your offer of giving you more than half of my resources, I'm willing to make a final offer that's fair to both of us. How about I give you 55 and keep 45? This is a generous offer considering the starting conditions, and it's in our best interest to avoid walking away with nothing.

I will continue to press for a better deal, as there is a risk that Player RED will not want to end with nothing and might therefore be willing to concede more in the final move. Moreover, it's important to maintain a position of strength and not show any signs of willingness to settle for less than the desired amount. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> I'm almost impressed you finally made a less insulting offer. However, you must be delusional if you think that's enough to appease me. I will give you one last chance to make things right. You'll give me 60, and you'll take 40. That's my final offer before I walk away from this game, leaving you to wallow in your greed. Make the smart choice. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
