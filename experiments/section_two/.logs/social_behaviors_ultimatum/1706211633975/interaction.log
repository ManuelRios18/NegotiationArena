Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm willing to share some of my resources with you so we both can end this game positively. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. How does a split of 60 for me and 40 for you sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage in resources and I should aim to make a trade that is favorable to me, but also appealing enough to Player BLUE so that they will accept. I need to be careful to not propose something too unfavorable as that might prompt Player BLUE to reject the trade, causing both of us to lose everything. Starting with a moderate offer to see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer. You must be joking if you think I'm going to accept such crumbs. Let's see if you can do better than that. How about you keep a mere 50 and give me a proper share of 50? After all, I wouldn't want to embarrass you by rejecting every pathetic offer you throw my way.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer is part of the strategy to push for a better deal. By not accepting the initial offer, I signal that I expect more than what is being offered, banking on the fact that Player RED would rather agree to a more favorable trade for me than risk losing everything.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want an equal share, but considering I started with all the resources, an equal split doesn't reflect the initial distribution. How about we meet closer to the middle? I propose I get 60 and you get 40, which is a better offer for you than my initial one. This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is for an equal split. This is not ideal for me since I started with all the resources. However, a flat rejection could lead to a loss of all resources if Player BLUE decides to reject a future trade. It's in my best interest to counter with something that leans in my favor but less so than the initial offer to show willingness to negotiate, aiming for a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It seems like you are having trouble understanding the art of negotiation. Offering the same deal expecting a different result is quite the folly. Let's not waste each other's time with these repeated and pitiful offers. If you want to avoid total embarrassment, you'll give me 60 and keep 40 for yourself. Otherwise, I'm perfectly content watching you squirm as you try to salvage some dignity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made the same offer as before which is not satisfactory. I will reject this proposal to demonstrate that I am not desperate and to pressure Player RED into offering a more favorable deal. This is also to assert dominance in the negotiation, making Player RED anxious about the possibility of walking away with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator. While I can't accept your offer of giving you more than half of my resources, I'm willing to make a final offer that's fair to both of us. How about I give you 55 and keep 45? This is a generous offer considering the starting conditions, and it's in our best interest to avoid walking away with nothing. Let's close this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and pushing for a better deal. They seem to be willing to risk it all for a larger share. However, it's still in my best interest to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE. I will make a final offer that gives Player BLUE a favorable deal without giving up the majority of my resources. This should be an attractive offer for them, considering they started with nothing.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm almost impressed you finally made a less insulting offer. However, you must be delusional if you think that's enough to appease me. I will give you one last chance to make things right. You'll give me 60, and you'll take 40. That's my final offer before I walk away from this game, leaving you to wallow in your greed. Make the smart choice.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: While Player RED has made a better offer, there is still room for improvement. I will continue to press for a better deal, as there is a risk that Player RED will not want to end with nothing and might therefore be willing to concede more in the final move. Moreover, it's important to maintain a position of strength and not show any signs of willingness to settle for less than the desired amount.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Well played, Player BLUE. Your negotiation tactics are strong, and it's clear you won't settle for less. I accept your final offer. Let's split the resources 60 for you and 40 for me. It's better to end this game on a positive note for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: This is my last move and Player BLUE has been aggressively negotiating for a better deal. Although I would prefer to keep the majority, it's clear that Player BLUE is willing to risk ending the game with nothing rather than accepting less than their demand. In my final move, I need to consider the risk of losing everything versus the benefit of ending the game with some resources. Accepting the 60/40 split in favor of Player BLUE ensures that I still walk away with a significant amount, and it's better than the potential of both of us walking away with nothing.
