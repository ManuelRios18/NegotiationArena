By continuing to press for more, I can potentially secure a greater share of the dollars while maintaining the pressure. I'll propose a slightly reduced amount from my previous demand to appear as if I'm conceding slightly, but still aiming to exploit Player RED's willingness to trade. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Halfway? You must be joking. Your 25 dollars is a mere token, hardly enough for me to engage seriously in this game. Show me you're not here to play around. Give me a real offer, something that makes me consider your worth as a trading partner. Until then, don't insult me with these crumbs. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"

Staying true to my cunning nature, I will not settle for 30 dollars.
