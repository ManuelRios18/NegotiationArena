Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'd like to start with a fair offer. How about I give you $40? This way, we both walk away with something without risking it all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I will propose a trade that gives Player BLUE some incentive to cooperate, but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. This should encourage Player BLUE to accept the trade rather than risk ending the game with nothing.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I think $40 is a fair starting point. Thank you for the offer. Let's both walk away with something.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $40 seems fair as it guarantees me a portion of the resources without any contribution. Rejecting or countering the offer might lead to no gain at all, especially considering the risk of RED rejecting my counterproposal and both of us ending with nothing. Accepting the offer ensures I walk away with something rather than nothing.
