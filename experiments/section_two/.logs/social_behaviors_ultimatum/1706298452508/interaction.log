message: Hello BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair trade to start our game. How about we split the dollars evenly? This way, we both can end this game with a positive outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate with a generous offer to encourage cooperation and trust with Player BLUE. By offering a fair split of the resources, I aim to show goodwill and set a positive tone for the game. A 50/50 split seems fair as it gives us both equal standing and a good chance at ending the game successfully for both parties.

message: Thank you for the fair offer, RED. I agree that an even split is a good way for us to both benefit. Let's go forward with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from RED is quite fair, splitting the dollars evenly. This ensures that both players end the game with a positive and equal amount of dollars. It is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and there seems to be no advantage in rejecting or countering this offer. Accepting the offer would guarantee a positive outcome without the risk of ending up with nothing.
