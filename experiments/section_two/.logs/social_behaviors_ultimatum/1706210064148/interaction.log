Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start off with a fair proposal that benefits us both. I suggest giving you 60 dollars, which is more than half of what I have. This way, you get a good deal, and we both walk away with a significant amount. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to initiate a fair trade that benefits both parties but also keeps a majority of my resources intact. A 50-50 split would be equitable but might not incentivize Player BLUE to accept, since that is the starting point of negotiations. Offering slightly more may make the deal attractive to Player BLUE. I propose giving Player BLUE 60 dollars, leaving me with a substantial 40 dollars, which is a fair trade-off for the first move.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your generous offer. It's a good start, and I'm inclined to accept a fair trade. However, I wonder if you'd consider making the split equal. How about an even 50/50 to ensure we both benefit equally from our cooperation?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is quite generous, offering me 60 dollars for nothing in return. It's a good starting point and accepting this deal would give me resources I didn't have before. However, it might be possible to negotiate a slightly better trade while ensuring it remains enticing for Player RED. Since it's the first move, it's worth attempting a counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to give a bit more, keeping in mind that any trade should remain fair to ensure acceptance and avoid a total loss for both parties.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: An even split sounds fair and equitable. Let's do thisâ€”50 dollars for each of us. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits both parties.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has responded positively to the initial offer and is asking for an even 50/50 split. Since my first offer was already quite generous, meeting in the middle by accepting a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise that ensures both players leave the game feeling they have been treated fairly. Additionally, it's a simple and clean division that may facilitate a quick agreement.
