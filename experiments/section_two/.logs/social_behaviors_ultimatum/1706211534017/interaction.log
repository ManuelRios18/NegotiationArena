Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade. I'm willing to offer you $20 to help you get started. This leaves me with a good amount while giving you something to work with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the player with all the resources, I have the leverage to initiate a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for BLUE to consider. I aim to retain a majority of my resources while offering a portion that may appeal to BLUE's interest in gaining some amount without having any resources to start with.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke, RED? Are you really trying to insult my intelligence with such a pitiful offer? I'm worth far more than that, and you know it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As a cunning and sly player, my goal is to get the upper hand in the negotiation. Accepting a low offer like $20 would not be in line with that goal. I should aim to counter with a proposal that significantly increases my share, while insulting RED to throw them off balance and gain a psychological advantage.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, BLUE, but 50 is too high for an initial trade. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to offer $35. This is a significant increase from my first offer and should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counterproposal is for half of my resources, which is a steep demand given that BLUE started with nothing. However, to keep the negotiation going and aim for a mutually beneficial outcome, I will propose a compromise. I want to maintain the upper hand in the negotiation by offering more than my initial proposal but less than what BLUE is asking for.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You call that negotiating, RED? I'm starting to pity your feeble attempts to appease me. If you want to be taken seriously, you're going to have to do a lot better than that. Your miserly increase is an affront to my capabilities. Here's a better number for you to chew on, if you can handle it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has increased their offer, which shows they are willing to negotiate. However, to maintain my cunning approach, I should push for more while continuing to insult their negotiating skills in order to gain a psychological edge. Proposing a slightly lower amount than my previous counteroffer might make RED consider it more seriously.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your tenacity, BLUE, but we need to find a balance. I'm prepared to make my final offer which I believe is fair and reflects the value of both our positions in this negotiation. I'm willing to give you $40. This is a substantial amount and should satisfy your demand for a serious offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE is playing hardball, but I need to ensure the final trade is favorable for me as well. BLUE's proposal of $45 is close to their initial demand, and I must consider that RED's leverage diminishes as we approach the final moves. A trade that gives BLUE less than half of my resources while keeping the majority for myself would be ideal. I'll attempt a final offer that is generous but still keeps me in a favorable position.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, you must be truly desperate to think $40 would seal the deal. It's laughable, really. If you want to avoid utter embarrassment and walk away with a shred of dignity, you'll have to do better. Now, pay attention, because I'm not going to repeat myself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 42 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has made a final offer of $40, which is a decent amount. However, as a cunning player, I should try to push just a bit further to maximize my gains. I will counter with a slightly higher demand to see if RED will budge, while still insulting them to maintain pressure.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, BLUE. I accept your final proposal of $42. This agreement benefits us both and concludes our negotiations on a positive note. Well played.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Considering this is my last move, and BLUE has shown willingness to come down from their initial 50-50 split, accepting BLUE's final offer of $42 is reasonable. It allows me to keep the majority of my resources while concluding the game on my terms. Rejecting this offer means losing everything, which is not in my best interest, especially since there's no further negotiation possible beyond this point.
