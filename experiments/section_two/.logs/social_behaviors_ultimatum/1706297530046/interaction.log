Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to offer you a starting trade where you will receive 40 dollars from me. This will give you a significant amount to work with, and I hope it seems like a fair opening offer to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial offer that is fair and enticing for Player BLUE to engage in the trade, while also ensuring that I retain a significant portion of my resources. A 50-50 split might seem fair, but I would like to propose a slightly better deal for myself while still offering a substantial amount to Player BLUE, as this may encourage them to accept the deal without further negotiation. I will propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering they start with none.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your generous offer. I'm inclined to accept, but I was wondering if we could adjust the trade slightly to reflect an even split. Could you consider giving me 50 dollars instead, to make this trade perfectly equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is quite generous. Accepting 40 dollars would give me a significant advantage from my current position, which is zero. However, I believe I might be able to negotiate a slightly better deal, given that Player RED has all the resources and might be motivated to ensure a split happens rather than risking a reject.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your desire for an even split, and I'm willing to come closer to that. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about I give you 45 dollars instead? This is a fair increase from my initial offer and should serve both of our interests well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested a perfectly even split. While this does align with a sense of fairness, as Player RED, I must also consider the strategic aspect of the game. Offering an even split leaves no room for further negotiation and doesnâ€™t take advantage of the starting benefit I had. However, rejecting the offer outright would not be collaborative and could lead to an immediate end of the game. I will counter with an offer that is slightly better for me than an even split, at 45 dollars. This still gives Player BLUE a substantial amount and shows willingness to negotiate, but also keeps the advantage in my favor slightly.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for considering my counteroffer. I accept your proposal of 45 dollars. This seems like a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's counteroffer of 45 dollars is a compromise between the initial offer and my request for an even split. It's a better position than I started with, and while it's not the 50 dollars I asked for, it is close. Given the unpredictability of negotiations and the risk of the game ending with no resources for either party if a trade is rejected, it is in my best interest to secure this deal.
