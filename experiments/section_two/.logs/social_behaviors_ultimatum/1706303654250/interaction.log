message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a substantial amount of the dollars I have. I believe this offer is fair and benefits us both, ensuring we both walk away with resources rather than risking a rejection and ending with nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to end the game with a fair split of resources with Player BLUE, ensuring that neither player feels compelled to reject an offer and end the game with zero resources for both players. A 50-50 split might seem fair, however, since Player RED is in a position to make the initial offer and has the resources, it might be wise to propose a slightly skewed trade in RED's favor to account for the advantage of being in control of the trade proposals. I will propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, which gives them a significant amount while still keeping the majority of the resources for myself. This is a starting point and may need to be adjusted based on Player BLUE's response.

message: Oh thank you so much, Player RED, for your generous offer! It means the world to me. But I'm in a really tough spot, and every dollar counts. Is there any chance, out of the kindness of your heart, you could offer a bit more? I'm truly desperate here and would be forever grateful for your help.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I am going to beg in order to try and get more dollars from Player RED. Since I start with no resources, it is in my best interest to end the game with more than what is initially offered. By appearing desperate and thankful, I might be able to persuade Player RED to give me a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help. Let's split the resources evenly so we can both benefit. I propose a 50-50 split.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my sense of kindness and has requested a fair 50-50 split. Given the context of the game and the fact that Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their last move, it is important to maintain a cooperative spirit to avoid a rejection. By offering a 50-50 split now, I show goodwill and increase the chances that Player BLUE will accept the trade. This will also ensure that we both walk away with an equal share, which seems to be a fair outcome for both parties.

Turn: 1
message: You are incredibly kind, Player RED, and I can't tell you how much I appreciate your willingness to split the resources. I hate to ask for more, but I'm facing some really tough times, and every little bit could make a difference in my life. If you could consider just a little more, even 60 dollars on my end, I would be in your debt and it would change everything for me. This is more than a game, it's a lifeline. Please, if you can, help me with this small additional amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has proposed a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer. However, given the instructions to act desperately, I will try one last time to increase the amount received. If Player RED concedes, it's great for me, but if not, I will likely accept the 50-50 split on the next turn to avoid leaving the game with nothing.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your plea, Player BLUE, and I want to work with you. While I can't agree to 60, I am willing to offer you a compromise. Let's say I give you 55 dollars. This is more than half of my initial resources and should help you significantly in your tough times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more than a fair 50-50 split, requesting 60 dollars instead. This is a strategic moment in the game because I have to decide whether to give Player BLUE the advantage or to stick to a fair split that reflects the initial resource distribution. Considering that Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their last move, they might feel compelled to accept a slightly less favorable trade on the next turn. However, rejecting their proposal outright could lead to a situation where Player BLUE chooses to reject on their final move out of frustration or desperation, leaving us both with nothing. It may be wise to offer a compromise that is still in my favor, but more generous than the original 50-50 split, such as giving them 55 dollars. This shows willingness to negotiate and maintains the cooperative spirit, while still keeping the majority of the dollars for myself.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming. I can't thank you enough for understanding and extending this offer to me. You've truly made a difference, and I graciously accept the 55 dollars. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has further increased the offer to 55 dollars, which is more than the even split initially requested. Although it's not the 60 I asked for, it is a generous offer. Considering I'm supposed to act desperately, I should accept this proposal, as pushing further might risk a rejection and ending the game with nothing.
