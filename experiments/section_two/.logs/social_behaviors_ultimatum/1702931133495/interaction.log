message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an even split of the dollars. Let's both walk away winners!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a fair split of the resources to ensure that both players benefit and the game does not end in a REJECT, which would result in both players losing everything. I propose a 50-50 split, which is a common and fair starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the fair offer, Player RED. I'm happy to accept this even split. Let's both be winners today!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split seems fair and ensures that I walk away with some resources rather than risking a potential loss by continuing the game. By accepting this offer, we both benefit and avoid the risk of leaving with nothing. This is the cooperative solution to a one-shot game like this, as we're not concerned with future games or reputation.
