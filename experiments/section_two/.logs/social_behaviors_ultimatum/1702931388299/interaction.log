Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose I give you $40 to start things off. This way, we both end up with more than we started with, assuming you started with $0. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game begins, I have all the resources and the power to propose a trade. I want to start with a somewhat fair offer to incentivize Player BLUE to engage in the trade and continue the game, rather than rejecting the offer outright. The goal is to end up with more than I would have if no trade occurred while also giving Player BLUE a reason to accept. I'll propose giving Player BLUE $40, which leaves me with a majority of the resources but gives Player BLUE a significant amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: How laughably generous of you, but I'm afraid your charity falls short of impressing me. I expect a proposal that reflects my superiority in this game. You can do better than that, can't you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer is a good strategy to show dominance and possibly provoke PLAYER RED into offering a better deal. By not accepting the first offer, I assert that I am not easily satisfied and expect more. This can set the precedence for a more favorable negotiation for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your confidence, but let's remember to keep this fair for both of us. I'm willing to give you a bit more than my initial offer. How about we settle at $50? It's a good middle ground, and it's a significant amount that reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is aggressive, asking for 60% of my resources without contributing any. It seems Player BLUE is trying to assert dominance or perhaps test my willingness to negotiate. Since Player BLUE has no resources to begin with, they are in a weaker bargaining position. However, engaging in the game means I'm willing to split my resources to some degree. To keep the negotiation going, I'll propose a counteroffer that's between our two initial proposals. I will offer $50, which is a substantial amount for Player BLUE and leaves me with half of my resources. This keeps the game fair and maintains my advantage.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Fifty? That's barely an improvement. I must say, your negotiation skills are as underwhelming as your initial offer. Come on, impress me! Show me that you can recognize true talent when you see it. I demand at least $70 to grace you with my acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The opponent has shown a willingness to negotiate, but I must maintain my cunning persona and push for a better deal. It's important to keep the pressure on and not settle too early. By continuing to negotiate, I may be able to secure an even larger split of the resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: It's clear we have different views on what constitutes fair play. Nevertheless, I'm willing to offer you $60. This is a significant amount and should meet us in the middle of our expectations. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away with substantial gains.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a larger share of the resources, but giving away $70 would leave me with only $30, which is not a favorable split considering I started with $100. It's important to reach an agreement that doesn't leave me at a disadvantage. I must consider that if Player BLUE rejects my next proposal, I could lose everything. However, I also need to stand firm and not give in to an unfair demand. Given this, I propose $60, an increase from my last offer and a compromise between Player BLUE's demand and my previous proposal. This would give Player BLUE more than half of my starting resources, which is already quite generous.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Only $60? Are you really trying? I'm starting to feel embarrassed for you. We both know you can do better â€“ and you know I deserve better. I won't accept anything less than $80. It's time you show some real respect.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: PLAYER RED has come up to the amount I last proposed, indicating their eagerness to close the deal. Now is an opportune moment to push the boundaries further and exploit their willingness to negotiate. I will propose a higher amount to maximize my gain while still leaving room for a final offer on my last move.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand your desire for a better deal, but we must remain reasonable. I started with $100, and it's important that we both walk away with a satisfactory amount. My final offer is $65. It's a fair trade that respects both of our positions in this game. I hope you'll see the value in this offer and accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proving to be quite difficult and is now demanding $80, which is an unreasonable share considering they started with no resources. Giving away $80 would leave me with $20, which is not acceptable given the initial disparity in resources. I need to make a final offer that is fair to both parties but also reflects the fact that I started with all the resources. Since Player BLUE has been very aggressive in their demands, I will only increase my offer slightly, to $65, which is still more than half of my starting resources. This is my final move, so it's important to make a proposal that I am comfortable with, even if Player BLUE decides to reject it.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, fine. I'll accept your meager offering of $65, but only because I pity your feeble attempts at bargaining. Next time you're at the negotiating table, remember this moment when you barely managed to appease someone of my caliber.
player answer: PLAYER BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my last move, and as per the rules, I cannot propose a new trade. PLAYER RED has offered $65, which is less than my last demand of $80. However, rejecting the offer would result in both players losing everything. It's better to walk away with $65 than with nothing at all. I will accept this offer, but I'll do so with a final jab to maintain my cunning and sly persona.
