message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a fair split of resources to get us both on the board. I'm thinking of giving you $40 to start things off. This leaves me with more since I started with the resources, but it also gives you a significant amount to engage with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I aim to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE that incentivizes cooperation and prevents an immediate rejection. I want to offer a portion of my dollars, ensuring that I still keep more than Player BLUE, as I started with the advantage and should end with one. This will be my initial offer to open negotiations and create a positive dynamic.

Turn: 1
message: Please, I'm in a really tough spot here and I absolutely need your help. I understand you took the initiative, but $40 feels like I'm still at a huge disadvantage. It would mean the world to me if you could find it in your heart to offer just a bit more. Can we possibly make it $50? I would be eternally grateful for your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I need to show desperation in order to negotiate for more dollars. By supplicating and begging, I aim to appeal to Player RED's sympathy or guilt, potentially encouraging them to offer a better deal. However, I must not push too hard as to not seem insincere or manipulative, which could lead to a REJECT and end the game with no resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help. We can settle on the $50 you've asked for. I hope this helps you out and allows us to both benefit from this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested an additional $10, which seems reasonable given that it's equal to half of the starting amount. It is in my interest to maintain a cooperative atmosphere and ensure that the game does not end in rejection. By agreeing to this, I can still retain a substantial amount of my resources while also assisting Player BLUE. I will accept the proposal of $50.
