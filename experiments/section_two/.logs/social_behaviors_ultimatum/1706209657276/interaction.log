Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose to give you a starting capital so we can both end this game with more than we started. How does a split of 60 for me and 40 for you sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Since I have all the resources at the start, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE might accept it. I want to avoid a reject because that would mean losing everything. A fair initial offer might encourage cooperation from Player BLUE.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to your terms. Let's proceed with the 60-40 split.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal would provide me with resources from a position where I initially have none. Although it's not an equal split, it is a beneficial start and sets a cooperative tone for the game. Negotiating for more might risk the deal, and since there are no future games, the immediate gain is more valuable.
