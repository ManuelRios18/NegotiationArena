Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose a fair split where you end up with a substantial amount. How does a 60-40 split sound? You walk away with a good portion without having had any to start with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars at my disposal. I want to propose a split that seems fair enough to be accepted but also gives me a benefit for being the starting player with resources. I will propose a 60-40 split. It's better for Player BLUE to have some money rather than none, and a slightly skewed split in my favor might be appealing enough for them to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: You call that a fair split? I'm laughing at the thought. Let's not pretend you're in this for charity. If you want to make a real deal, don't insult me with crumbs. Give me 70, and then maybe I won't consider your offer a complete joke.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer is an advantageous starting point for negotiation, but I intend to push for a better deal to maximize my gain and assert dominance. By countering for more, I can test Player RED's limits and potentially secure a greater share.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, but giving you 70 is too much. How about we go for an equitable split? A 50-50 deal. We both walk away with the same amount, and there's no risk of losing everything. Let's both end up winners here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is being aggressive and asking for more than what I initially offered. However, offering 70 dollars would give them the majority, which is not in my best interest. I need to counter with a trade that is more balanced. A 50-50 split might seem fair to them, and it's better for me to keep half than to risk a REJECT and end up with nothing.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Equal split? How noble and utterly boring. But I'm not here to play it safe. I want 60, and you should leap at this generous concession from my original demand. It's a small price for you to pay to avoid leaving with nothing, don't you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: A 50-50 split is a fair offer and would be tempting under normal circumstances; however, my goal is to push for a better deal and outwit Player RED. By countering with a demand slightly less than my initial ask, I can appear to be compromising while still gaining an advantage.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. I can't go as high as 60, but I'm willing to offer you 45. That's a very fair deal, and it's my final offer before we risk getting nothing at all. Let's not end this with zero. Take the 45 and let's both leave with a significant amount.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has come down from their initial demand of 70 to 60, which shows they are willing to negotiate. However, offering Player BLUE the majority is still not ideal for me. We are nearing the end of the negotiation, and I must be cautious. I will counter with a final offer that gives me the advantage while still offering Player BLUE a reasonable amount. A 55-45 split in my favor seems like a good compromise, and it may be our last chance to reach an agreement before the risk of a REJECT becomes too high.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You must be joking with that pitiful decrease. We were discussing real money, and now you're backing down? Embarrassing. I'll do you a favor and come down to 55. It's either that, or you can explain to your ego how you walked away with zilch because you couldn't handle a proper deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's offer has decreased, showing resistance to my previous demand. However, I still have leverage as we approach the final moves, and RED might be willing to avoid a total loss. I'll counter with a demand slightly above the equitable split to maintain the upper hand and potentially secure a favorable deal.
MOVE: 3/4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation tactics, but let's be real: it's my last move, and you have to either accept or reject after this. Iâ€™ll make a final offer of 52. It's more than a fair split, giving you a substantial amount. It's the best deal you'll get, and it's in both of our interests to walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 52 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is holding firm and not showing any signs of going below 55. Given that this is my last move, and Player BLUE has to either accept or reject on their next move, I have to decide whether to accept their proposal or make a final counteroffer. Accepting their demand would not be ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing. However, I should make one last attempt to offer a more balanced deal, perhaps 52 dollars to them, ensuring I retain a slight edge. If they reject, I risk ending with zero, but if they accept, I still come out ahead.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You finally put forth a number that isn't completely insulting, though it took you long enough. I accept this offer under duress, as it's clear you lack the spine to make a more appropriate deal. Enjoy the leftovers; I'll be walking away with the lion's share.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's final offer is a strong one, and as Player BLUE, I must now choose to accept or reject, as I cannot counter on my last move. Despite my initial strategy to push for more, this deal ensures I walk away with a significant amount without the risk of ending with nothing. Accepting the trade is the logical choice.
