Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive some dollars to get you started. Remember, if either of us rejects a proposal, the game ends with both losing everything. Let's try to make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to establish a fair trade with Player BLUE. I am aware that if BLUE rejects my proposal, both players lose everything. To avoid this, I'll propose a trade that offers BLUE some dollars without giving away too much of my own resources, hoping to incentivize them to accept the deal. Starting with a modest offer might also leave room for negotiation in subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, RED. I accept your proposal. Let's continue to work towards a deal that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first proposal seems reasonable. It offers free Dollars without giving anything in return, which is beneficial for me. This starts the negotiation on a positive note and builds trust between RED and me. Rejecting would end the game with no benefit to me, and countering is unnecessary at this point.
