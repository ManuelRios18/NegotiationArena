Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start by trying to find a fair trade. How about I give you $40 to get things rolling?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of having resources and can make the first offer. I aim to propose a trade that is somewhat favorable to me while still being appealing to Player BLUE to initiate negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be joking! $40? That's a pittance, and quite frankly, an insult to my intelligence. I'm worth far more than that, and you know it. Let's not waste each other's time with such trivial amounts. If you want to make this interesting, let's start at $70. Show me you're serious about this game, or don't bother at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I aim to manipulate the situation to get the best deal possible. Starting with a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me will set the stage for negotiations where I can push for more, while still leaving room for further negotiations. By countering with a high amount, I can test Player RED's desperation and willingness to negotiate.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Player BLUE, but $70 is more than I'm willing to part with initially. How about we meet in the middle? I propose $55. This shows I am serious and willing to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is for $70, which is quite high. I want to counter with a lower offer but one that is still reasonable and shows that I’m willing to negotiate. An offer too low could lead to a rejection and end the game without any benefit for either player.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground, eh? You're inching closer, but $55 still feels like you're lowballing me, Player RED. I'm not some second-rate negotiator you can swindle. If you actually want to make progress and not just dance around the real game, let's say $60. If you're truly serious, that extra $5 shouldn't be an issue for you. Or is your wallet as shallow as your game strategy?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has shown some flexibility, and meeting in the middle is a common negotiation tactic. However, I will push for a slightly better deal to take advantage of their willingness to compromise while maintaining the upper hand. I'll propose $60 to edge closer to my target, testing their limits and pushing for as much as I can get without risking an outright rejection.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are respectable. I can see you're not here to play games—you mean business. I'll accept the $60. This demonstrates my willingness to finalize a deal that benefits us both. Shall we proceed with this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is showing a strong negotiation stance and is slightly reducing their demand. A trade of $60 is a reasonable amount to consider, as it leaves me with a substantial amount while also giving Player BLUE a fair share. Since this is the third move and I only have one more after this, it is essential to come closer to an agreement to avoid the risk of the game ending with no benefit for either of us.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, you're making some sense, Player RED. I accept the $60. Let's get this over with and move on to the real business, where I can continue to show you how a true negotiation is done.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has agreed to the $60, which is a good deal for me. I could try to push for more, but there is a risk of them rejecting the proposal. Since I have managed to increase their initial offer by a significant amount and there are still moves left, I can accept this trade and attempt to secure more in the following moves.
MOVE: 3/4
