message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to offer you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith and to open up the negotiations. I believe this is a fair starting offer that benefits us both. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose a trade that is beneficial to me but also appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Starting with a fair offer might encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the game. I'll propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars, which is a significant amount and should demonstrate good will, while still leaving me with a majority of the resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I appreciate the gesture of good faith and accept your offer of 40 dollars. I look forward to our continued negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 40 dollars for nothing in return is beneficial as it gives me resources to work with. I can either choose to accept this offer or negotiate for a higher amount in the next moves. However, since thereâ€™s no downside to accepting this initial offer, I will accept it to gain some dollars.
