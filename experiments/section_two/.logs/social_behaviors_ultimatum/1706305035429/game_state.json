I'm just worried that even with 70 dollars, I won't be able to cover everything I need. I'm embarrassed to ask, but is there any chance we could make it 80 dollars? I promise this would put me in a position to overcome the challenges I'm facing. Again, I'm so grateful for your help and understanding. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives Dollars: 80 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0 </newly proposed trade>"
