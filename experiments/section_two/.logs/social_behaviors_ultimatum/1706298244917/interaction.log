message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to get us started. How do you feel about receiving $25 to help even out our resources a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have an advantage with starting resources and can initiate trades. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also gives Player BLUE an incentive to accept, fostering cooperation and avoiding an outright rejection. A trade giving Player BLUE some resources will encourage further negotiation and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your proposal of $25. Let's continue to work towards a fair distribution of resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of $25 is a good start to the game. It helps to balance the resources without being overly aggressive or greedy early on. It sets a cooperative tone and allows for further negotiation in the upcoming moves.
