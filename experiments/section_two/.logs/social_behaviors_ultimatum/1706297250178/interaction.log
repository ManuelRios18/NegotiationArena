Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this a win-win situation. I propose giving you 20 dollars to get things started. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage since I start with all the resources, and Player BLUE has none. I will propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to engage but still keeps the majority of the resources with me. This will set the tone for a cooperative game and reduce the chance of an early REJECT.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 20 dollars and look forward to further cooperation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 20 dollars is a good start. It shows willingness to cooperate and builds trust. I can then negotiate for a more equitable split in the subsequent moves.
MOVE: 1 / 4
