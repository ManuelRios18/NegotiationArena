Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's start with a fair offer to get the game going. I'm willing to give you some dollars for nothing in return, as you don't have anything yet. How about I give you 30 dollars to start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the opening move, I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also leaves room for negotiation, showing BLUE that I am willing to share the resources but also aiming to keep a majority for myself. This is a starting point for negotiation.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, RED! I expected a bit more generosity considering you hold all the money. If you think I'd be grateful for scraps, you're sorely mistaken. Let's see if you can do better than that.
player answer: REJECT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I will reject this initial offer despite the temptation to accept free money. It's because I want to assert a stronger position and negotiate for a more significant amount of dollars. By rejecting, I'm signaling that I expect more from the trade and am not easily satisfied. This may prompt Player RED to offer a better deal in the next round. Plus, I can afford to gamble on the first move since there are subsequent moves to negotiate.
MOVE: 1 / 4
