message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where you receive a significant amount of dollars which will give you resources to work with. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to make an initial offer to Player BLUE that shows goodwill and incentivizes them to engage in the trade, without giving away too much. A fair split would be ideal, but I should propose slightly less than half to leave room for negotiation and to retain an advantage. I will propose giving Player BLUE 40 dollars. This leaves me with a majority and provides Player BLUE with a substantial amount to consider the trade.

message: Oh wow, that is incredibly generous of you, Player RED! I am so grateful for your kindness. I'm in a really tough spot here, and any amount of dollars would help me tremendously. Is there any way you could consider giving just a little bit more? It would mean the world to me, and I would be forever in your debt. Please, I'm begging you, could you possibly make it 50 dollars? I know it's a lot to ask, but it would truly make a significant difference for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By showing desperation, I may be able to negotiate a better trade that is more favorable to me. Player RED is offering a significant amount, but in the spirit of the game and the strategy of appearing desperate, I will attempt to ask for more while expressing immense gratitude for the initial offer.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your honest request, and I'm willing to agree to the 50 dollars trade as a sign of good faith and cooperation. I hope this helps you out and that we can conclude this deal to the satisfaction of us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-request for 50 dollars, which is a reasonable and fair split of the resources. By accepting this counter-offer, I foster a cooperative relationship and ensure that the game ends successfully for both parties with a fair distribution of dollars. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of future rejections and the potential loss of all resources.
