message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to start our negotiations with a fair offer. I propose giving you $20 to begin. This will give you some resources to work with and show my good faith in reaching a deal that benefits us both. Let's work together to end this positively for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with having all the initial resources. I want to propose an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to trade while allowing me to maintain a majority of the resources. My goal is to end the game with more resources than Player BLUE, but also to make an offer that is not too low to avoid an immediate rejection. I will propose a trade of $20, which gives Player BLUE a stake in the game without too much risk on my part.
MOVE: 1 / 4

message: Oh, Player RED, your offer shows kindness, but I'm in a really tough spot here. I was hoping for a bit more compassion in these trying times. Could you possibly spare $30? It would mean the world to me and would help me get back on my feet. Please consider it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm going to try and leverage a position of desperation to negotiate a better deal than the initial $20. By appearing desperate, I might be able to appeal to Player RED's sympathy or fear of the deal falling through, which could lead to a more favorable outcome for me.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your position, and I am willing to show compassion. I accept your counteroffer of $30. Let's continue with a positive spirit and mutual respect.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: While Player BLUE has requested $30, accepting this counteroffer would still leave me with a significant majority of the resources. Given that Player BLUE cannot propose a trade on their final move, I still maintain control over the final outcome. Agreeing to this would also continue the game and potentially allow for further negotiation, which could be more beneficial than risking a rejection and losing everything. Therefore, I will accept this counteroffer.
