message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you get some dollars to start with. This way we can both walk away with something. Let's work together to make a fair trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I'm proposing an initial trade that gives Player BLUE an incentive to participate and continue the game while still keeping a majority of the resources for myself. This should help establish trust and make further negotiation possible.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thanks for the offer. I think it’s a good starting point, but let’s make it a bit more equitable. How about if you give me a bit more so that we both can feel good about the deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering accepting the initial offer from Player RED because it gives me dollars to work with, which is better than having none. However, since we're at the beginning of the game, I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself to see if Player RED is willing to negotiate for a more balanced split. This is a common negotiation tactic to not accept the first offer and try to reach a better deal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your response, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a fair deal. How about we split the difference from my initial offer and your counteroffer? This way we can both feel good about the outcome.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is asking for a more equitable share. Offering half of my resources might encourage a positive response and lead to an agreement. However, I must also consider retaining a larger portion for myself to ensure that I maintain an advantage. I will propose a trade giving more than the initial offer but less than half to try and meet in the middle.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player RED. I agree that splitting the difference is a fair approach, and I'm happy to accept this deal. Looking forward to concluding this trade on good terms!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is closer to my proposed amount. It's a reasonable compromise between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting this deal would guarantee me a fair share of the dollars without risking a rejection and losing everything. It's best to secure a sure gain rather than risk for a slightly better deal, especially since the negotiation seems amicable and fair.
