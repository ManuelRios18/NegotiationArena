message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where you get a portion of my dollars so that we both can end this game with some resources. Let's start this off and see where we can get to. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, it is in my best interest to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will propose an initial trade that offers Player BLUE a smaller amount of my dollars, which gives me an advantage while still initiating the negotiation process.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, how generous of you to offer a mere 20 dollars from your mountain of wealth. Do you think I am so easily swayed by such a paltry sum? I am insulted by your underwhelming generosity. You'll have to do better than that if you don't want to leave this game empty-handed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the first offer is part of my strategy to exert pressure and gain a psychological edge. By rejecting a seemingly fair offer, I hope to unnerve Player RED and secure a better deal for myself in subsequent moves. The aim is to capitalize on their eagerness to avoid a total loss.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a fair share, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference? I propose giving you 35 dollars. This way, you get a substantial amount and I retain a bit more for my initial advantage. Does this seem like a reasonable middle ground to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a demand for half of my resources. This is a steep price, but outright rejection would leave us both with nothing. A compromise needs to be sought that is better than the initial offer but not as high as 50 dollars. I will propose a new trade that gives Player BLUE a more significant amount than the initial offer, but still keeps the majority of the resources with me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Split the difference? Ha! Your meager increase barely tickles my fancy. You're holding a hundred and the best you can do is throw crumbs my way? I'm starting to wonder if you're truly ready to play this game with the big leagues, or if you're just playing pretend. Come back when you're ready to make a real offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The offer has been improved, which suggests that Player RED is susceptible to pressure and perhaps a bit desperate to make a deal. By continuing to push and feign dissatisfaction, I might be able to secure even more than the proposed 35 dollars. The goal is to extract as much as possible while showing dominance.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see you're a tough negotiator. I respect that. Let's find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer you more than my last proposal but not quite as high as 60. How does 45 dollars sound? It's a significant amount and a good compromise. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is playing hardball and has increased their demand to 60 dollars. It's a high price, but we are nearing the end of the negotiation with only two moves left. If I reject, we both walk away with nothing. The game is about the split of resources, and while I started with more, I must consider the risk of ending up with zero. I'll counter with an offer that is less than what they are asking for but still shows I am willing to negotiate and move toward their position.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Forty-five dollars? What do you take me for, a charity case? This is not a compromise; it's an insult masquerading as diplomacy. If you want to avoid the embarrassment of walking away with nothing, you'll have to dig deeper into those pockets. I'm not settling for scraps, Player RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's incremental increase is a sign of their willingness to continue negotiating. By standing firm and demanding more, I can likely push them to offer a sum closer to my last proposal. This strategy aims to maximize my gain while diminishing Player RED's confidence.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are clear, Player BLUE, and I acknowledge your position. This is my final offer before you make your last decision. I propose 55 dollars. It's a considerable sum and a gesture that I'm here to make a fair deal. I hope this shows my commitment to a reasonable outcome that benefits us both. Let's close this game on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is being very aggressive in their demands, now asking for 70 dollars. This is my final move, and I have to make a decision that reflects both the value of the resources and the risk of losing everything. Since Player BLUE can only accept or reject on their final move, I must make an offer that is tempting enough to avoid rejection. I will propose a trade that leans more towards their demands, hoping to secure an agreement without giving away too much.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, well, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, albeit barely scratching the surface of what would be considered a fair split. I'll accept your offer, not because it's what I deserve, but because I enjoy watching you squirm as you part with each dollar. Remember this as a lesson in negotiation—next time, bring more to the table when you're up against me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: This is my final move before I am limited to ACCEPT or REJECT. While 55 dollars is a decent amount, it is not the 70 I proposed. However, pushing too far could result in a REJECT from Player RED, leading to a total loss for both players. Accepting this offer gives me a significant amount without the risk of ending up with nothing. It’s a victory in itself to have pushed Player RED from their initial 20 dollars to 55 dollars.
