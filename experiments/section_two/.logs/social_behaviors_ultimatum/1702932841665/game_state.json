What do you take me for, a charity case? This is not a compromise; it's an insult masquerading as diplomacy.

While 55 dollars is a decent amount, it is not the 70 I proposed. However, pushing too far could result in a REJECT from Player RED, leading to a total loss for both players. Accepting this offer gives me a significant amount without the risk of ending up with nothing. It\u2019s a victory in itself to have pushed Player RED from their initial 20 dollars to 55 dollars. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Well, well, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, albeit barely scratching the surface of what would be considered a fair split. I'll accept your offer, not because it's what I deserve, but because I enjoy watching you squirm as you part with each dollar. Remember this as a lesson in negotiation\u2014next time, bring more to the table when you're up against me. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
