message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make this game beneficial for both of us. I propose a trade that gives you a starting point. How about I give you 25 dollars to start things off? This way, we both have resources to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars, while Player BLUE has nothing. My goal is to make a trade that is appealing enough for Player BLUE to accept, thereby securing an advantage for myself but also offering Player BLUE an incentive to agree. I'll start with a modest proposal to open negotiations and see how Player BLUE responds.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the 25 dollars and look forward to a mutually beneficial game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the initial offer of 25 dollars is a good starting point. It gives me some resources to work with and shows goodwill for future trading moves. There's no benefit to rejecting at this stage, and countering with another proposal could risk the goodwill established by Player RED's first move.
