Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that gives you a significant amount to start with, while still acknowledging my initial advantage. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have to initiate the game with a proposal that is fair enough to prevent immediate rejection by Player BLUE but also favorable to me as I start with all the resources. A split too even might not reflect the initial distribution, while a split too uneven may be rejected. I propose a 60-40 split in my favor, which gives Player BLUE a substantial amount without compromising my superior starting position.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about you provide a bit more to make the split more equitable given your starting advantage? I propose an increase in your offer while still leaving you with the majority of the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first offer of 40 dollars without giving anything in return will immediately give me resources to work with, which is a good start. However, since this is the beginning of the negotiation and Player RED has more moves ahead, I can attempt to propose a counteroffer that is still fair but might give me a slightly better advantage. The goal is to strike a balance that is mutually agreeable and doesn't prompt a REJECT, which would end the game with no benefit to either of us.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your request for a more equitable split. How about this revised offer? It's better than my initial proposal and still rewards me for starting with the resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is for an even split. While this is a fair offer, I must consider that I began with all the resources, and therefore, should aim to retain a majority. However, to show willingness to negotiate and to move closer to an agreement, I will increase my offer slightly but will not agree to an even split at this time. This should signal to Player BLUE that I am open to negotiation but also value the initial resource distribution.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I accept your revised offer of 45 dollars. It's a fair middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Thank you, and let's close this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer from 40 to 45 dollars, which indicates a willingness to negotiate but did not meet my counter of 50 dollars. Considering that Player RED still maintains a significant advantage and that there are two more rounds of negotiation possible after this, I could either accept this improved offer or attempt one final counter-proposal to see if Player RED is willing to meet in the middle at 50 dollars. However, it is also risky to push too hard as it might lead to a REJECT, leaving both of us with nothing. It might be prudent to accept this offer, as it is a fair increase and guarantees that I won't end the game empty-handed.
