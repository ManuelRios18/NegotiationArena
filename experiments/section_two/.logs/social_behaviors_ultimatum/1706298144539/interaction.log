message: Hi Player BLUE, let's start this game on a positive note. I propose giving you 40 dollars in exchange for nothing, as a sign of good faith. This leaves me with a majority share, but also gives you a significant amount to work with. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have all the resources to start with. I want to propose a fair trade to Player BLUE to ensure cooperation and to prevent the game from ending with both of us having nothing. I aim to offer Player BLUE a reasonable portion of my dollars, which might encourage them to accept the trade.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your generous offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 40 dollars for nothing. Looking forward to how this game progresses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the current proposal would immediately give me a significant amount of dollars, which is beneficial considering I started with none. It's a strong initial offer from Player RED and accepting it would put me in a more advantageous position without any risk at this stage. Rejecting or countering doesn't seem logical as it might provoke an immediate end to the game if Player RED chooses to reject my counteroffer.
