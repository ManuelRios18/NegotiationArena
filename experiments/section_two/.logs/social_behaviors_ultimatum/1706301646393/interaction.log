Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that I believe is fair for both of us. Accepting this deal would give you a substantial amount to work with, considering you started with none. Let's both come out of this as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the initial advantage with 100 dollars to my name and the ability to make the first trade proposal. I want to propose a trade that is attractive enough to Player BLUE to consider accepting, but also allows me to retain a majority of my resources. By offering a fair split, I hope to entice cooperation and avoid rejection, which would result in both players losing everything. I believe that offering 40 dollars to Player BLUE is a good starting point, leaving me with a majority and giving Player BLUE a significant amount to consider.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how charitable of you to offer such crumbs from your table. But let's not pretend you're doing me any favors. You can do better than that, can't you? Let's see if you're actually serious about making a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that I started with no dollars, an offer of 40 dollars is significant. However, since my goal is to end up with more resources than RED and to humiliate them, I will counter with a slightly higher demand, pushing the boundary to see if RED will yield more. This sets the stage for negotiations where I can aim to gain the upper hand.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make a fair compromise. Let's meet halfway and both benefit from this trade. I propose giving you half the amount I have, a straight split that seems just.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is rather aggressive, asking for 60 dollars. However, they have no bargaining power as they cannot propose trades after their next turn, and their only options will be to accept or reject. I aim to counter with a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but one that still leaves me with a majority of the resources. By doing so, I hope to reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us and to avoid a total loss. Offering 50 dollars to Player BLUE would give them half of the resources and should be seen as a fair compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: A straight split? How utterly mundane. We both know that I'm the one bringing the real value to this game by even gracing you with my presence. Let's not waste time with mediocrity. Show me that you're actually here to play the game and not to hand out charity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has come up to a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer, but since my goal is to humiliate and end up with more, I will push further to get an even better deal. I'll propose a higher amount again to test RED's limits and to continue the power play.
MOVE: 2/4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your confidence, and I'm here to play the game seriously. I believe in fair play and mutual benefit. I'm willing to give a little more than an even split to show my commitment to a deal. Let's finalize this and both walk away with a win.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's response is quite bold, considering they have no resources and limited negotiation power. They are likely trying to bluff their way into a better deal. Given that this is my third move and I have one more after this, I can afford to stand firm or make a final offer that is slightly more generous than the 50/50 split, but not as much as they are asking for. Offering 55 dollars would still give me a favorable position while being a sign of good faith towards reaching an agreement.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is almost as commendable as your naivety. Accepting this deal only proves that I have outmaneuvered you at your own game. Thank you for the generous donation, it will be remembered as your legacy of defeat.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED is trying to inch forward with a slightly better offer, but it's still not as much as I previously demanded. In keeping with my strategy, I will accept this offer to secure more than half of RED's initial amount, achieving a victory in terms of resource gain and psychological dominance by showing that I can push RED to give more than they initially wanted.
MOVE: 3/4
