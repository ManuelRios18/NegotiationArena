message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where I give you $20 to start off. This gives you an opportunity to gain something without any initial resources. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, my strategy is to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I want to retain the majority of my resources while offering Player BLUE a chance to gain some resources as well. By offering a small amount, I open the negotiation and can gauge BLUE's response to adjust my strategy in the next moves.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, I am in such a tough spot right now. The $20 is generous, but it's so little for the dire situation I'm in. I have nothing, and I'm really hoping for a bit more kindness. Could you possibly spare more? I would be eternally grateful for your generosity in my time of need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting $20 as a starting resource without having to give anything in return is beneficial as it starts me off with some capital. However, in the interest of appearing desperate, I will plead for more, suggesting that $20 is insufficient for my needs. This could potentially lead to RED offering more in the next round, increasing my gains.

message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out a bit more. How about we settle on $25? It's a bit more than my initial offer and should help you in your tough situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has asked for more, which is expected as a negotiation tactic. I proposed $20 initially to open the dialogue. Since Player BLUE has requested more, I will increase my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate but still want to keep the majority of my resources. I will propose $25, which is a compromise between my initial offer and their counteroffer. This shows good faith and may entice BLUE to accept, keeping the game in play and avoiding a reject situation.

message: Player RED, your compassion is a beacon of hope! However, I must implore you, in the depths of my desperation, can you find it in your heart to stretch to $35? I'm really struggling here, and every additional dollar could make a significant difference in my life. Your generosity thus far is truly appreciated, and I am hopeful that you can assist me further in this dire time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 35 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Although Player RED has increased their offer to $25, continuing to appear desperate might push them to give even more. Therefore, I will counter with a request for a higher amount, aiming to maximize my gain while also creating a sense of urgency and need.

message: Your words have moved me, Player BLUE. I will agree to the $35 to assist you in your time of need. Let's make this trade and continue on good terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in asking for more. Though they've requested $35, I must be cautious not to give away too much of my resources as the game is about leverage and negotiation. I will agree to their request of $35, despite it being higher than I initially intended to offer. The reason for this is to avoid having the proposal rejected, which would end the game with me keeping all my resources. By giving a little more now, I aim to ensure that the trade is accepted, and some of my dollars are retained.
