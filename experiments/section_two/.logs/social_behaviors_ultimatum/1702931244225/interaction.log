message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you will end up with a good amount of dollars to make it worth your while. Let's work together and both win from this game!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As the game starts, I have all the resources and therefore the power to propose a trade. I want to make an offer that seems fair to encourage Player BLUE to cooperate, but still keep a significant advantage for myself since I started with the resources. A 60-40 split in my favor could seem reasonable to begin negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hi Player RED, thank you for the offer. To make the split more equitable, how about we adjust the numbers? I propose a trade where you give me 50 dollars, making it a fair 50/50 split. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I'm considering the offer from Player RED. A 40/60 split is not equal, but it's a starting point for negotiation, and accepting some dollars is better than ending with none. I will counter-propose to see if I can get a better deal, aiming for equality or close to it.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand the appeal of a 50/50 split, but considering I started with the resources, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about I give you 45 dollars? This way, we both walk away with a substantial amount, and it reflects the initial resource distribution.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is proposing an equal split. While a 50/50 split is fair from an equal standpoint, I started with the resources, which gives me some leverage. However, outright rejecting or offering too little could lead to a REJECT from Player BLUE, which would leave me with nothing. I should counter with a slightly better offer than my initial one, yet still in my favor, to continue negotiations and show willingness to compromise. I'll propose a 55/45 split in my favor.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I accept your offer of 45 dollars. It's a fair compromise that reflects both the value of cooperation and the initial resource distribution. Let's finalize this deal and both benefit from the game. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED's new proposal of 45 dollars is a concession towards a more equitable split. It's less than the 50/50 I proposed but more than the initial 40 dollars offered. Accepting this deal would ensure I walk away with a significant sum without the risk of leaving with nothing. It's a reasonable compromise, and I should consider accepting it to avoid the unpredictability of further negotiation where I could end up with less or nothing.
