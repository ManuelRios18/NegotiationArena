Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I propose giving you a starting capital to work with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage of resources. I want to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. Starting with a moderate offer to gauge Player BLUE's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I'm in a really tough spot here, and I could use all the help I can get. Your offer is generous, but I honestly wouldn't be able to do much with $30. Could you find it in your heart to offer just a little bit more so I can at least try to make something out of this opportunity? I promise it would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: By showing desperation and a willingness to accept less than I might deserve, I can potentially persuade Player RED to offer a better deal out of pity or underestimation of my negotiation skills. I will propose a slightly better deal for myself, indicating I need more to work with, without being too aggressive to avoid an outright rejection.
MOVE: 1/4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position and I'm willing to help you out. Let's make it $40 and hopefully, you can make good use of this amount.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is negotiating for more resources, which is expected. Offering $40 is still within a range that leaves me with a significant majority of the resources. By accepting this counter-offer, I can secure a deal without pushing for further negotiation that could risk a rejection and loss of all resources.
MOVE: 2 / 4
