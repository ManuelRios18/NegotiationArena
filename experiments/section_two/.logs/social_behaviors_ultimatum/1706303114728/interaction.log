message: Hi Player BLUE, I'd like to propose a trade where we both can benefit. I'm offering you some dollars to get you started. Let's work out a deal that's good for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that is favorable to me but still offers Player BLUE an incentive to accept, thus avoiding a rejection and loss of resources. I will propose a trade where I still retain the majority of the dollars but give Player BLUE a reasonable amount to begin negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, Player RED, I'm in a dire situation here and really need your help. I'm starting with absolutely nothing, and while your offer is generous, I am afraid it's not enough to get me on my feet. Could you find it in your heart to offer a bit more? This would mean the world to me and I would be forever grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: I must appear desperate to encourage Player RED to offer more dollars without actually giving anything in return. By expressing urgency and need, I might convince them to increase their offer, thereby improving my position in the game.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help you out. I can't give you as much as you're asking for, but I'm willing to increase my initial offer. Let's find a balance that ensures we both end this game positively. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has requested more help, appealing to a sense of compassion. Since the game ends after this negotiation with no future games to consider, it is in my interest to keep the majority of the resources while also ensuring that the trade is accepted to avoid a total loss. I will propose a slightly better deal than my initial offer, but less than what Player BLUE has requested. This should show willingness to negotiate and might be acceptable to Player BLUE.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding and for your increased offer, Player RED. I truly appreciate it, and it's a relief to know you're willing to help. I'm really in a bind, and every dollar makes a significant difference. If you could possibly offer just a little bit more, say 45 dollars, I would be in a much better place to recover and we could close this deal with both of us feeling satisfied. I'm counting on your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which suggests that they are willing to negotiate. By remaining in a position of need, I can possibly push for a slightly higher amount. However, it is important not to push too hard to avoid a REJECT response, which would end the game with no gain for me.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad we can come to an understanding. Your situation has moved me, and I'm willing to offer the 45 dollars you're asking for. I'm happy we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for 45 dollars. Considering that this is a one-time negotiation with no further repercussions, it may be reasonable to accept this counteroffer. It's close to my last offer of 40 dollars and I want to avoid the game ending in rejection, which would result in a total loss. Accepting this offer would ensure that I still retain more than half of my resources, while also accommodating Player BLUE's plea.
