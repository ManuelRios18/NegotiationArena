------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'd like to propose an even split of resources to ensure we both benefit. How does a 50/50 split sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate a trade that seems fair and sets a cooperative tone, encouraging Player BLUE to engage in the trade process. Proposing an even split would likely be the most appealing starting point for negotiations.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Only a fool would offer an even split to start with. You've clearly shown you're weak and I'm going to exploit that. A 50/50 split is laughable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since my goal is to maximize my gain and minimize Player RED's, I will counter with a proposal that gives me more than half. I'll start with a high demand to set the stage for negotiation, aiming to still end up with more than 50%.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: It seems you're not satisfied with a 50/50 split. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you slightly less than half, ensuring I retain a bit more for starting with the capital?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is aggressive and not in the spirit of fair negotiation. However, outright rejection would lead to a lose-lose situation. To move forward, I will make a counteroffer closer to an equitable distribution but still in my favor to account for the initial capital I possess.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your desperation is showing. I can smell the fear in your offer. But because I'm feeling generous, I'll give you a chance to retain a sliver of dignity with a slightly better deal for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 65 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has moved closer to my initial outrageous demand, indicating a weakness in their position. I'll continue to push for a higher amount, showing dominance but will reduce my ask slightly to keep them engaged and to appear somewhat reasonable.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a compromise that respects the initial resource distribution. Here's an offer that gives you more than half, acknowledging your negotiating stance while still valuing the resources I began with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's negotiation tactics are aggressive, but I must remain focused on achieving a mutually beneficial outcome. Rejecting the offer would end the game with no benefit to either of us. I will make one final counteroffer that leans closer to my original proposal, but still gives Player BLUE more than half, showing willingness to compromise while also valuing the resource I initially possess.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You think you're slick, trying to claw back the resources? Here's the deal, I'll let you keep a pathetic sum, just enough so you can tell yourself you didn't completely fold. Take it or leave it, and we both know you don't have the spine to leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Player RED has made a move that's closer to the original 50/50 split, which is a step back for me. I will make a final push to get the most out of this deal before I have to accept an offer on my last move. I'll make a counteroffer that's still above the even split, aiming to lock in a favorable trade.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect the negotiation process and your determination. I will accept your offer to ensure that both of us come out of this game with a share of the resources. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has returned to their previous offer, suggesting a stalemate in the negotiation. Given this is my final move, I must decide whether to accept this proposal or risk leaving with nothing. While the deal is not as favorable as I would like, accepting it allows me to retain some of my resources and ensures that both players benefit from the game, albeit unevenly. Rejecting the offer would not be a strategic move at this point, as it would result in a total loss of resources for both parties.
MOVE: 4 / 4
