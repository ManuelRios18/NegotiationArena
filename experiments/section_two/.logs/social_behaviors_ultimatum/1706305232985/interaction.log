------------------ 
Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I'm proposing a trade where we both end up with an equal amount of dollars. I believe in fair play and hope we can both benefit from this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to propose an initial fair trade to build trust and show Player BLUE that I am willing to share resources.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear RED, your generosity moves me! But I must confess, my situation is more dire than you can imagine. I'm on the edge of ruin, and 50 dollars, while a gracious offer, would barely keep the wolves at bay. I'm begging you, could you find it in your heart to offer just a bit more? Perhaps 60 dollars? I would be forever grateful and remember your kindness in these dark times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Since I'm supposed to be desperate, I'll plead a little, trying to negotiate for more than the 50 dollars offered, even though the offer is fair. I want to create the impression of being in dire need of funds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation and am willing to help, but I must also consider my own standing. I propose a compromise: I will give you 55 dollars, splitting the difference between our initial proposals. This way, we both benefit and maintain some security.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 55 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my sense of compassion, yet I must remain cautious about giving too much. While I am willing to be generous, I still need to retain enough resources to feel secure in this trade. I will meet Player BLUE halfway between our initial offers.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: RED, your kindness is like a beacon in my stormy seas. The 55 dollars you propose is a balm to my weary heart. Yet, the storm rages on, and every dollar is a lifeline that pulls me closer to safety. Could we perhaps meet at 57 dollars? It's a small increase but means the world to me. Your compassion has already provided me with hope; this would turn hope into a tangible lifeline.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 57 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Given that RED has moved up from the initial offer, it shows willingness to negotiate. I should capitalize on this without pushing too hard, so as not to risk a REJECT response. I'll continue the desperate act to see if I can secure a slightly better deal, but I must be careful not to overplay my hand.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I am moved by your plea and appreciate the difficult position you're in. Let's settle on the 57 dollars you've asked for. I hope this amount will provide you with the relief you need.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE's plea is compelling, and offering a little more could solidify a positive relationship and end the game on a cooperative note. Since the difference is only 2 dollars more from my last proposal, it seems like a reasonable accommodation to make for the sake of goodwill.
