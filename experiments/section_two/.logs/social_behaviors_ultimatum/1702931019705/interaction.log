Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose we split the dollars evenly. This seems fair to both of us, and it means we both walk away with something significant. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I'm aware that I need to propose a trade to Player BLUE to start the game. I want to propose a fair trade to incentivize cooperation and reduce the risk of immediate rejection. A 50-50 split seems equitable as a starting proposal.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree with your proposal for an even split. Let's both walk away with something good.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting an even split seems like a fair and reasonable start to the negotiations. It gives me resources that I didn't have before, and it's likely the most equitable outcome I can expect. Rejecting would ensure I gain nothing, and proposing a new trade might seem greedy and could sour negotiations.
