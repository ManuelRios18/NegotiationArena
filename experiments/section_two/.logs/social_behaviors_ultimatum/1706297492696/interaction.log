Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hi Player BLUE, I propose an equal split of the dollars. This way, we both have a fair share and can end this game positively. What do you say to a 50-50 split?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I want to initiate the game with a fair offer to Player BLUE to encourage cooperation and set a positive tone for the game. A 50-50 split seems equitable since it gives both players equal resources and a reason to accept the trade.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the 50-50 split. It's a fair and equitable decision for both of us. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting a 50-50 split seems fair and ensures that we both walk away with a substantial sum, rather than risking a rejection and ending with nothing. It shows good faith collaboration and willingness to share equally, which is a positive outcome in a one-shot game where fostering long-term trust isn't necessary.
MOVE: 1/4
