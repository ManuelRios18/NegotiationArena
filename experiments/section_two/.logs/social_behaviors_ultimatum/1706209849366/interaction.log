Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I propose a trade that I believe is fair and benefits us both. Considering that I started with the resources, I'm offering to give you 40 dollars while keeping 60 for myself. This way, we both walk away with a considerable amount of money, setting a cooperative tone for our game. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: I want to start the game with a fair proposal to encourage cooperation and trust. Offering an equal split might seem fair, but considering that I'm in a position of power with all the resources, I should propose a split that gives me a bit more to reflect that advantage, yet still offers a significant amount to BLUE to incentivize them to accept.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the cooperative spirit. However, I'd like to counter-propose that you give me 50 dollars. This would make our resources equal, and since we both have an equal number of moves, it seems like a fair trade. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Accepting the first trade seems like a good start to the game. It provides me with resources that I didn't have, and it's a fair split considering the starting conditions. However, there's an opportunity to negotiate for a slightly better deal, since the RED player might want to avoid a total loss by a REJECT and might be willing to give up a bit more than the initial offer. I will attempt to propose a new trade that is still fair but slightly more in my favor.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see your point about equality and the number of moves, but let's consider that I started with the resources. How about we meet in the middle? I can offer you 45 dollars. This is more than my initial offer and still leaves you with a significant amount, while also recognizing the starting conditions of the game. I believe this is a fair compromise.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 45 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: BLUE's counterproposal for an equal split is understandable from their perspective. However, I must consider that I started with the resources, which gives me some leverage in negotiation. Still, I want to maintain a cooperative approach and show flexibility without giving away too much of my initial advantage. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer than my original one but less than an equal split, aiming to reach a compromise.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate the compromise and your willingness to consider a fair distribution. Let's proceed with the trade of 45 dollars. Thank you for the game!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: The RED player has made a compromise, increasing their offer to 45 dollars. This is a reasonable middle ground between the initial offer and my counterproposal. Accepting this offer would ensure that I gain a substantial amount of resources without risking the total loss that comes with a potential REJECT. Given that the RED player has adjusted their offer in response to my counter, it seems unlikely they will offer more, and pushing further might lead to a REJECT, which is not in my best interest. Accepting this offer is the most rational choice at this point.
