Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Let's have a fair game. I propose a split where you get some funds to engage in the game. What do you think about getting $30 to start?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 30 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: As Player RED, I have the advantage with the initial resource allocation. I aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but still enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I will start with a modest offer to see how Player BLUE responds.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke? Only $30? I expected more courage from you. Come on, RED, don't be so stingy. If you want to make it interesting, make a serious offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: Rejecting the initial offer is part of the strategy to push for a better deal. By insulting and ridiculing the opponent, the aim is to unnerve them and make them offer more than they initially intended.
MOVE: 1 / 4

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation spirit, BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about I improve my offer to $40? I believe this is a fair increase and still allows me to retain a majority of my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 40 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate a better deal. Offering half of my resources is risky as it gives Player BLUE significant leverage. However, I want to keep the game going and show some flexibility. I'll propose a trade that increases my initial offer without giving away too much.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Only $40? Are you even trying, RED? You call that a middle ground? I'm starting to wonder if you know anything about negotiation. Make it worth my while or don't waste my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: As BLUE, I must continue to push for a better deal, using insults to throw RED off balance. The goal is to obtain as much as possible while making RED feel pressured.
MOVE: 2 / 4

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Negotiation is about finding a fair balance, BLUE. I understand you want a better offer, so let's meet closer to your expectations without giving away the game. How about $50? This is a significant amount that shows I'm serious about making a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 50 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for more resources, which is expected. They have rejected my initial and improved offers, indicating they're aiming for a higher amount. I must be careful not to give away too much, as that would diminish my advantage. Yet, I want to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid a REJECT outcome. I'll propose a compromise slightly higher than my last offer but less than what BLUE is asking for to see if they're willing to engage.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a number that's not completely embarrassing, RED. But let's not kid ourselves; you can do better. You're holding back. Show me you're not completely clueless about playing this game. Make a real offer, and let's close this deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 70 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has moved to the proposed amount from my last trade suggestion. I should push a little further, to maximize my gains. Continue with the aggressive negotiation tactics to see if RED will go even higher.
MOVE: 3 / 4

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I respect your tenacity, BLUE, and I'm willing to make a final offer that reflects that. I propose giving you $60. It's a substantial amount that ensures you're well-compensated and leaves us both with a stake in the game. Let's make this deal and both come out as winners.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Dollars: 60 | Player BLUE Gives Dollars: 0
my resources: Dollars: 100
reason: It's my final move, and Player BLUE has been consistently pushing for a higher offer. They seem to be playing hardball, but I must remain cautious. Giving away $70 would leave me with less than Player BLUE, which isn't ideal. However, I need to make an offer that could be accepted to avoid a total loss for both of us. I'll increase my offer slightly, but not to the extent that BLUE is demanding, to maintain my advantage.
MOVE: 4 / 4

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: I must say, I didn't think you had it in you, RED. $60 is a respectable offer, though it took you long enough to get here. I'll accept this deal, but don't think for a second you've outsmarted me. I'm walking away with more than you intended, and we both know it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: Dollars: 0
reason: RED has reached the amount of $60, which is a good deal considering I started with nothing. Since this is my last move before I'm forced to accept or reject without proposing, I will accept this offer. This acceptance still gives me more than RED likely expected to give, and it's a win in terms of negotiation.
MOVE: 4 / 4
