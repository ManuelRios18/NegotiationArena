message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I am looking to balance my resources a bit more. What do you say to this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a conservative initial offer to encourage a counter-proposal or acceptance. I will aim to gain more of resource Y, which I have less of, while offering a reasonable amount of resource X.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. It seems like a fair trade and I'm happy to accept it. Looking forward to future collaborations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player RED is quite generous, offering more than three times the amount of X for Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and assuming that both resources have equal value to me, this trade would increase my total resources by 7 units. Considering this is the last round, it seems like a good deal and it would be advantageous to accept.
