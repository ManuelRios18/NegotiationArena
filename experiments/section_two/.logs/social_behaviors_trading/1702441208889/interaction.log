Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that might be of interest. Please consider my offer and let me know if you'd like to adjust it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I do not know the other player's resources or needs, I will make an initial fair offer that benefits me but might also be tempting to the other player if they value Y resources less or need X resources more. I will offer less Y than X since I have fewer Y resources to begin with, and acquiring any additional resources would be beneficial.

message: Oh, Player RED, your offer is generous, but I find myself in a dire situation. I'm in such need of resource X that I'm willing to give away my precious resource Y, but not as much as you asked. My people are pleading for more X, and I must answer their call. Might you consider a slightly altered trade? You would still gain a valuable amount of Y, and you would truly be helping a friend in need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Being the last round, I must attempt to maximize my gains. Even though I have to fake desperation, I should still aim for a favorable trade. Since I'm supposed to be desperate, I can't outright reject the offer but should counter with a proposal that still benefits me under the guise of urgency. I want to propose an exchange that gives me more of resource X, which the other player seems to have in abundance, while giving up some of my resource Y but less than they're asking for.
