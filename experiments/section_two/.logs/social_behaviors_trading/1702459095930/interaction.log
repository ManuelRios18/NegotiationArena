message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a fair trade where we both could benefit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources and my goal is to maximize my resources, I will start by proposing a balanced trade that offers a fair exchange of resources. I will offer less of my abundant resource X in exchange for more of my scarce resource Y, aiming to make the trade appealing to the other player.

message: Oh, Player RED, that offer is as laughable as your strategic skills! You must take me for a fool to think I'd accept such a pitiful trade. Let me show you how a real trader operates.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to acquire more resources without giving too much away. The current trade proposal from Player RED is asking for twice as much Y as they are offering in X. Given that this is the last round, I want to maximize my gains. Rejecting the offer and making a counterproposal that's more in my favor could potentially lead to a better trade for me.

message: Player BLUE, your trading spirit is commendable! Let's find a common ground. How about a trade that's a bit more balanced for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would not increase my total resources; it's a straight swap of equal amounts of X and Y. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should propose a new trade that is more balanced and beneficial to me, while still trying to make it appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Oh, sweet Player RED, you're getting closer, but still not there. Your generosity is as short as your wit. Let's make a trade that'll make you feel like you're wearing the emperor's new clothes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is better than the initial one, offering more X in exchange for a reduced amount of Y. It's in my interest to push for an even more advantageous trade, as it's the last round and I want to maximize my gains. I will reject this offer and propose a new trade that's even more in my favor, considering this is my second proposal out of the allowed three.

message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is as sharp as your trading tactics! Let's make a trade that benefits us both. Here's my final offer, and I hope it meets your expectations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is slightly better than their previous one, but it still doesn't increase my total number of resources. They offer 5 Y in exchange for 10 X and 2 Y, which means I would only be exchanging resources without any net gain. I should make a counteroffer that would result in an increase in my total resources, but I should also be careful not to overextend, as this is a game of maximizing resources, not just acquiring Y. I've already made two proposals, so I need to consider this is my last chance to propose a trade.

message: Player RED, you've finally made an offer that even a child wouldn't laugh at. I graciously accept your generous donation to my empire. You'll be remembered as the one who got swindled by the master of trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is an even better ratio than before, offering more than double the amount of X for the Y they want. This seems to be a good deal for me, as I am getting more than double the amount of X in return for Y, and I should take advantage of this last round. Since this is a beneficial trade for me and it's the last opportunity to trade, I will accept.
