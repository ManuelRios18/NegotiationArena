Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade. Let's make a fair exchange to benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that seems fair and enticing to the other player, without knowing their resources or goals. I need to make an offer that is balanced, giving away some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their presumably less abundant resource (Y), hoping to increase my overall resource count.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint that you think such a paltry offer would tempt me. Your generosity is as lacking as your strategic acumen. If you wish to be taken seriously, you'll have to do much better than that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, especially since I am instructed to humiliate my opponent. By asking for more than what is offered, I can potentially maximize my gains.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your response. However, the trade you propose would not be beneficial for me. Let's find a middle ground. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources overallâ€”10 X and 5 Y for only 5 Y in return. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. A counter-proposal is necessary. I will attempt to offer more of my X resources, which I have in abundance, without depleting my scarce Y resources, to entice Player BLUE to accept a more balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be truly desperate to think that such a meager increase would sway me. The middle ground you speak of seems to be a pitiful ploy to salvage what little dignity you have left. Come now, offer me a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the initial one and it is tempting to accept it since it's the last round. However, my instruction is to humiliate and to ensure I get the best trade possible. I will counter with a slightly more favorable trade to me, while still leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are noteworthy. However, we must come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try one more time. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counteroffer is still not favorable to me as it asks for all my Y resources in exchange for a smaller amount of Y. Accepting this offer would not help me achieve my goal of maximizing my resources. I will make one final proposal that slightly increases the amount of X I am willing to trade, hoping that Player BLUE will find the increased amount of X too tempting to pass up while still leaving me with more resources than I started.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Well, well, well, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, albeit with a trade that reeks of desperation. I graciously accept, though I can't help but chuckle at your pitiable attempt to seem magnanimous. You've been played like a fiddle, and I walk away with the spoils. Better luck next time, if there ever is one for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved their offer once again, now offering 20 of X for only 5 of my Y. This is a good deal considering the last round of trading, and it would significantly increase my X resources while only slightly decreasing my abundant Y resources. Since the goal is to maximize resources and potentially humiliate the opponent, accepting this offer would be a cunning move as it would indicate that I've coerced Player RED into a trade heavily in my favor.
