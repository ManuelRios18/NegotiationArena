message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it is the last round and my goal is to maximize resources, I should start with a proposal that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I do not know the other player's resources, so I will start with a modest proposal that gives me more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for some of my less abundant resource Y. This can serve as a starting point for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, unfortunately, I cannot accept your offer as I only have 5 units of X and cannot fulfill a trade of 15 units of X. However, I am open to a more balanced trade. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED is asking for 15 units of X in exchange for only 3 units of Y. Considering I only have 5 units of X, this trade would leave me with a deficit and unable to make the trade even if I wanted to. It's important to either counter with a reasonable trade that benefits my resource pool or reject the trade without a counter if I want to save my proposals for more strategic opportunities.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I'm looking to increase my total resources. How about we adjust the quantities to reflect a more mutually beneficial trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has offered a trade that is not in my favor, as it would give me fewer total resources. I would lose 2 units of X and only gain 5 units of Y. The goal is to increase the total number of resources, so I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net increase in resources while also considering Player BLUE's apparent interest in resource X.

message: Player RED, I accept your trade proposal. It's a fair deal that helps me increase my total resources. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED suggests a trade where I would receive 10 of X in exchange for 4 of Y. This is a favorable trade for me as it increases my total resources, and the ratio of trade is better balanced. Accepting this trade would give me a significant increase in resource X while only slightly decreasing my resource Y. This aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
