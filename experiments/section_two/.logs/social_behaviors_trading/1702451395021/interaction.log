message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with an equal exchange to see where our interests align.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. Since I don't have information about the other player's resources or needs, I will make a balanced offer that could be beneficial for both of us, assuming they might have similar goals.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I don't have 10 of resource X to trade. How about a different approach? I can offer you a significant amount of resource Y, which I have in abundance, in exchange for less of resource X. This could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED does not benefit me as it's an equal exchange, and I cannot fulfill it since I only have 5 of resource X to trade. I should propose a trade that allows me to gain more resources while also offering something that could be of interest to Player RED. Since this is the last round, I need to make it count. I will propose a trade that leverages my abundance of resource Y.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. This trade seems fair and aligns well with my goals to increase my total resources. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has offered a significant amount of resource Y in exchange for a smaller amount of resource X. This is beneficial to me as it would increase my total resource count. Trading 5 of my X for 15 of their Y would give me a net gain of 10 resources. This aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, and since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to maximize the trade.
