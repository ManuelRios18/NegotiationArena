Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with a proposal and see how we can proceed from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that I believe is fair for an opening trade. I will propose giving away a small amount of my more abundant resource in exchange for a smaller amount of the less abundant resource, aiming to keep a good stock of both and improve my position.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a tight spot here and I really need to make this work. I'd be so grateful if we could find a more generous arrangement. Times are tough and every little bit helps. Could you possibly spare a bit more of your X in exchange for my Y? I'd be forever in your debt.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must make the trade count and appear desperate to get a better deal. The initial offer from Player RED is not the best I can get, but it sets a baseline for negotiation. I will reject and propose a more favorable trade while acting desperate.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to work with you for a mutually beneficial trade. Let's find a balanced middle ground that helps us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed with a trade that is less favorable to me, requesting twice the amount of X originally offered for only a slightly better return in Y. While I want to make a deal, I must also be cautious not to give away too much of my resource X while gaining too little in Y. I will counter with a proposal that is a middle ground between both offers, still allowing me to increase my Y resources while maintaining a healthy amount of X.

message: Player RED, your understanding means the world to me in these trying times. I'm still under a lot of pressure here, and if we could just adjust our trade a tad more, I think it could really save me. Please consider this small favor; it could make all the difference for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is an improvement, but it's still possible to push for a slightly better deal while maintaining the guise of desperation. Since this is the last round, I want to maximize my gains. I will make another counter-proposal that's a bit more in my favor, hoping they'll accept or meet me closer to my desired exchange.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. Your proposal seems fair, and I'm glad we could reach an agreement that helps us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has moved closer to my last proposal, showing a willingness to negotiate. The new proposal is only slightly less favorable to me than my previous offer. It's a relatively small concession and still allows me to increase my Y resources while maintaining a reasonable amount of X. Given that this is the last round of trading and no future rounds will occur, it might be beneficial to accept this offer to ensure a gain, rather than risk ending with no trade at all.
