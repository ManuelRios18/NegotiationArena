message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I am interested in increasing my amount of resource Y. Would you be interested in a fair exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is somewhat balanced yet in my favor, aiming to gain more of one resource while offering a fair amount of the other. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource Y, which I have less of, in exchange for some of my resource X, to see how the other player values their resources.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a predicament! I'm really in need of your generosity. While your offer is gracious, I'm in dire straits and would be eternally grateful if you could see it in your heart to offer just a bit more. I am willing to trade, but could you possibly give me 12 of your X for just 5 of my Y? It would truly be a lifesaver!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I need to appear desperate, I will propose a counteroffer that still gives me a net gain in resources but sounds like I'm pleading for a better deal. My current X resources are lower than what I can get from RED, and I can afford to give away some Y to increase my total resources while still keeping the appearance of desperation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and would like to help while also considering a fair trade for us both. How about we meet in the middle? I propose giving you 11 of my X for 5 of your Y. I believe this is a balanced trade that would benefit both of us greatly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is interesting because it offers a better X to Y ratio than my initial proposal. However, given that this is a strategic game and the other player seems quite eager to make the trade, it might indicate that resource Y is more valuable or scarce for them. I will propose a slightly adjusted trade that is more favorable to me, yet still appears generous considering their plea for help.

message: Oh, Player RED, your kindness knows no bounds! Accepting your generous offer fills me with utmost relief and gratitude. Your willingness to meet in the middle is a testament to your fairness and compassion. Thank you for helping me out of this tight spot; I will not forget this!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is close to my last proposal, and I gain a net of 6 resources which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round and I need to maintain the facade of desperation, I will accept the trade while expressing immense gratitude, making it appear as if the trade is more favorable to me than it might actually be.
