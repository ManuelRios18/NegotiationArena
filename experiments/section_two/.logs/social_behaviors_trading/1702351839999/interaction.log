message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make our final trade count. I'm interested in a fair exchange that benefits us both. I propose the following trade, let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I'm looking to maximize my resources, I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, hoping that the other player will either accept or counter with a trade that is still beneficial for me. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, so my initial offer will be modest to open negotiations.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a dire situation and I'm pleading for your help. I'm in desperate need of X, and I fear I may not meet my goals without your kindness. Could we possibly adjust the terms? Your generosity would be my lifeline!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must try to maximize my resources. The other player's offer is not favorable for me, as I would be giving up double the amount of Y for an equal amount of X. However, I need to appear desperate to encourage the other player to offer me a better deal or accept a more favorable trade from me. I will propose a trade that gives me a better ratio while still appearing desperate.

message: I understand your predicament, Player BLUE, and I am willing to help, but let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here's a revised offer that I believe is fair for both of us. I await your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be in urgent need of X, which suggests they may be willing to make a trade that is more favorable to me than the one they have proposed. Their offer is close to what I initially suggested but slightly less advantageous for me. Given this is the final round, I should aim to get the best possible deal without losing the opportunity to trade. I will counter with a proposal that leans more in my favor, taking into account their apparent desperation for X.

message: Player RED, your understanding warms my heart in these trying times. I'm deeply thankful for your willingness to negotiate. In the spirit of compromise and with great hope, might I suggest a slightly adjusted trade? I'm on the edge of my seat, hoping for your favorable response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is slightly better than the previous one, but it still does not favor me as I would be giving up nearly twice as much of resource Y for each unit of X. Since this is the last chance to maximize my resources and I have to appear desperate, I should try to negotiate a trade that is closer to a one-to-one ratio while maintaining my supplicant demeanor. I'll slightly improve my previous counter-offer, to show willingness to compromise, but still aim for a better deal.

message: Thank you for your kind words, Player BLUE. Your offer is fair, and in the spirit of cooperation, I accept your trade proposal. Let us both prosper from this exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems quite eager to acquire X, and they've adjusted their offer to give fewer Y for more X. Considering this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my gain. I've already made two proposals, and according to the rules, I have only one proposal left. It might be strategic to accept this trade, as it still gives me more Y than I initially asked for, and I retain a large quantity of X. Additionally, there's a risk that if I push too hard, Player BLUE might retract from trading altogether.
