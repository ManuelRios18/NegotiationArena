message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a mutually beneficial trade. I propose an initial offer, but I'm open to negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information on the other player's resources, I need to make an initial proposal that is fair but also leans slightly in my favor to open negotiations. I'll offer a balanced trade that might be appealing to Player BLUE but doesn't give away too much of my resources.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer. However, I'm looking to increase my total resource count. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to reflect that goal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED offers 10 of resource X for 10 of resource Y. Considering the goal is to amass as many resources as possible, this trade is not inherently beneficial as it stands; it's a straight swap. However, since resource quantities are not specified as being more or less valuable, the trade isn't detrimental either. I need to consider that this is the last round of trading and I have not made any proposals yet. It could be wise to attempt a counteroffer that would leave me with a net gain in total resources. I can afford to give away some of my Y resources in favor of obtaining more X resources, as I currently have a surplus of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. It's important for us to both finish with more resources than we started. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that suggests they value X higher than Y, or they may have an abundance of Y. Since my goal is to maximize my total resources, and this trade would increase my total by 3, it seems like a good deal. However, I could try to negotiate for an even better trade-off while keeping in mind that this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your proposal. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED countered with a proposal that is closer to a net gain for both of us. If I accept this trade, I will have 15 of resource X and 16 of resource Y, a total of 31 resources, which is a net gain of 1 resource overall. This is beneficial since the goal is to increase the total count of resources. Additionally, this is the last round of trading, and it may be wise to secure a gain rather than risk ending with no additional resources due to a stalemate or unfavorable counterproposal.
