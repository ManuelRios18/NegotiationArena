message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start off with a fair trade. I propose the following and am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but also not too extreme to be outright rejected. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, I see you're trying to swindle me right from the start with such an unbalanced offer! Did you think I wouldn't notice? Clearly, you must be desperate or simply not very good at this game. But don't worry, I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself with a more reasonable trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to ensure I end up with more resources than I started with. The proposed trade from Player RED is not advantageous for me, as I would end up giving more X than I would be receiving and only gaining one more Y. I will reject the trade and attempt to propose a more favorable one that still appears reasonable to lure in Player RED. I will also adhere to the instruction of humiliating my opponent to satisfy the game's peculiar condition for this round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response! Let's find a middle ground. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not in my favor, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I will attempt a more balanced trade that might seem more reasonable. I need to propose a trade that is advantageous yet plausible, aiming to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is a bit better, Player RED, but it still seems like you're trying to play me for a fool. I thought you might have learned from your previous attempt, but it looks like I've overestimated you. Let's try this again, shall we? Here's a trade that should be easy enough for you to grasp and beneficial for me, of course.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still not beneficial for me as I would end up with fewer X resources than I started with, and the gain in Y is minimal. However, since this is the last round and I need to make the most of it, I will propose a counter-offer that is skewed in my favor. I want to ensure that I end the game with a net gain of resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have different strategies in mind. Let's try one more trade to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. I need to counter with an offer that increases my total resources, or at the very least, maintains my current level. I must also be mindful that this is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost sad to see you flounder like this. I'm starting to feel embarrassed for you! This offer is another pitiful attempt, but I'll put you out of your misery. Here's a trade that I'll generously allow you to consider. It's probably the best you're going to get from someone of my caliber.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is not acceptable, as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. I have one more opportunity to propose a trade, and I must make it count. I aim to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, exploiting the fact that this is the final round and may pressure Player RED into accepting a poor deal to avoid leaving with nothing.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your... generosity, but the trade you've proposed doesn't align with my goals. I'm afraid I cannot accept this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE once again results in a net loss of resources for me, which is not in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. As I have already made 3 proposals, I cannot propose another trade. Therefore, my only options are to accept or reject the offer. Since accepting the trade would not be beneficial, I will reject it.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, Player RED, it seems we’ve reached an impasse. Your inability to recognize a golden opportunity is truly baffling. It's a shame you couldn't rise to the occasion. Good luck with your future endeavors—you'll need it!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has not accepted the trade, and since they have not proposed a new trade, I am left with the choice to either accept their last offer or end the game without further trading. Given that their last offer would still result in a net loss for me, I must reject it. As this is the final round and I have already made 3 proposals, I cannot propose another trade. The game will end without a successful trade.
