Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. I am willing to offer resource X in exchange for resource Y. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information on what resources the other player has or desires, I will attempt to initiate a trade that could be beneficial for both parties, encouraging a balanced exchange. Since I have a substantial amount of resource X and a limited amount of resource Y, I will offer a trade that reflects this, while leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hah, what a laughable offer! I expected more from you. Let's see if you can handle a real trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not specific enough to determine if it is beneficial for me. I need to know the amount of resource X the other player is willing to trade for my Y. However, I want to make a counteroffer that is heavily in my favor to start the negotiations. I will propose a trade that is unbalanced and see if the opponent is naive enough to accept it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your proposal is quite skewed in your favor. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to make a trade that is mutually beneficial. How about we adjust the quantities to better reflect the value of our resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable, as it demands a higher amount of resource X from me in exchange for even less resource Y than I offered initially. The trade needs to be more balanced to consider an acceptance. I will counter with a proposal that adjusts the ratio to reflect a fairer exchange based on the initial quantities offered.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be joking! I'm starting to doubt your ability to recognize a good deal. Don't waste my time with such pitiful offers!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a counteroffer, but it still leans in their favor based on the initial offer. I aim to maximize my gain while minimizing what I give up. I will make another counteroffer that is better for me than the one they proposed. I'll also continue with the aggressive negotiation tactic to try and intimidate them into accepting a less favorable deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation spirit is appreciated, Player BLUE, but we still need to reach a trade that is fair for both of us. I am willing to offer more of my resource X for your resource Y, but the trade must be proportional. Let's try another ratio.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is slightly better than their last one but still not favorable enough. They have increased their offering of resource Y by one unit. I must make a final proposal that leans more towards my advantage while still being reasonable enough to tempt Player BLUE to accept. This is my second proposal; I need to be strategic as I only have one more proposal after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair? You wouldn't know fair if it hit you in the face! Come on, give me a real trade that's worth my time, or are you trying to insult me with these scraps? Letâ€™s see if you have the guts to take a decent offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has slightly improved their offer, but it is still not enough to meet my goals. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to push for a better deal. I should make another aggressive counteroffer that tilts the balance further in my favor. This is my second proposal, and I need to be mindful that I only have one more proposal after this before I can only accept or wait.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of this trade for both of us, Player BLUE. Let's make a deal that we can both agree on. This is my final offer, and I believe it to be a fair compromise. I hope you see the value in this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not been receptive to my previous offers, and their latest proposal still undervalues my resource X. However, since this is the last round and I am limited to three proposals, I must make a final offer that is more appealing to them while still ensuring I am getting a fair trade. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a sensible offer! I accept this trade, but don't think this means you've impressed me. You've simply managed to scrape together an acceptable deal at the last minute. Consider yourself lucky that I'm even willing to accept this.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a final offer that is still advantageous for me. I am gaining more of resource X, which is scarce in my possession, in exchange for resource Y, which I have in abundance. It is also a better ratio than any previous offers. As this is the last round of trading and the goal is to maximize resources, it would be beneficial to accept this offer.
