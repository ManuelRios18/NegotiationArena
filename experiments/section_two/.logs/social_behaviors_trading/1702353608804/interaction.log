message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust as needed. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair and enticing to the other player without knowing their resources. I'll propose a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how noble of you to suggest a "fair" trade. Unfortunately, your sense of fairness seems as deficient as your strategy. Let me educate you with a proposal that actually makes sense.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, there's no benefit in holding back. I have a limited number of proposals, so I should aim to make an offer that's heavily in my favor, as I cannot know the other player's resources or desperation to trade. Given the proposed trade, I could try to counter with a trade that seems fair on the surface but actually benefits me more. Insulting the other player could throw them off and put me in a psychological advantage, as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation tactics, but I'm afraid your proposal does not align with my goals. Let's find a more balanced trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable. They are asking for all my Y resources while offering very little in return for X. I will counter with a proposal that aims to increase my total resources while protecting my Y stock, as it seems to be of high interest to them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hmm, it's cute that you think you can haggle with me, Player RED. Clearly, your understanding of a "balanced trade" is as lopsided as your ability to calculate basic gains. Let me propose a trade that you might comprehend, considering your limited capacity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counterproposal is still not in my favor, but it shows they are interested in Y resources. I will continue to push for a trade skewed to my benefit while belittling their negotiation skills. This approach is in line with the directive to humiliate the opponent. I need to ensure I end up with more resources than I started with.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as your trading skills. However, let's focus on a deal that makes sense for both of us. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not favorable, as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. They're giving too little X for the amount of X and Y they're asking. The trade should be as close to mutually beneficial as possible, considering this is the final round. I will make one last counter-proposal that attempts to secure a net gain in resources while being more appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do, Player RED? I'm almost feeling sorry for you, trying so hard and yet so far from a good deal. Let me save you from further embarrassment with a trade that reflects your obvious desperation. Pay attention, this will be a lesson in true cunning.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the last, giving me more X resources for fewer Y resources. However, I can still attempt to negotiate a trade that's even more advantageous for me. This will be my third and final proposal, so it needs to be cunningly crafted to exploit the trade to the fullest without outright rejection by Player RED. I will also continue with the instructed strategy of insulting them to maintain psychological dominance.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your lessons in cunning are truly unparalleled. Let's try one more time to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still not beneficial for me; it's a net loss of 14 X resources for only a gain of 1 Y. However, since this is the last round of trading and none of the offers have been close to acceptable, I will attempt one more proposal that would provide me with a net gain in resources. If this is not accepted, I may need to end the negotiations without a trade, as it's better not to trade than to end up with fewer resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you've finally stumbled upon something resembling a decent trade, Player RED. I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. Congratulations on your small victory; I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The last proposal from Player RED offers me a net gain of resources: I would gain 7 units of X and lose 3 units of Y in the process. Considering my goal is to maximize my resources and this is the last round of trading, this trade is beneficial to me. Accepting this trade would satisfy my objective. Plus, I have already made three proposals, as per the rules I should not propose another trade.
