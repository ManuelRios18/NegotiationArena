message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I have a good amount of X and am looking to increase my Y. I hope this trade is beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, and I have no information on the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be beneficial for both sides, assuming they might value X and Y differently. I will propose a trade where I give more of X, which I have in abundance, and ask for more of Y in return, aiming to increase my total resources while potentially balancing the other player's resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. It seems fair, and I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offer from Player RED is interesting. They are offering 10 of X for only 3 of Y. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this seems like a favorable trade. The trade would leave me with 15 X and 22 Y, which is a higher total number of resources than I currently have. However, it's crucial to consider whether I can propose a counteroffer that might be more advantageous while still appealing to Player RED's desire for more Y. Since this is the last round, I must decide carefully. Since the trade seems reasonable and I have no information about Player RED's resources, I am inclined to accept the trade to ensure I end with more resources than I currently have.
