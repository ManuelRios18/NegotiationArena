message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking to balance out my resources a bit. Would you be interested in a trade where we both could potentially increase our total resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I have to make a strong initial proposal that benefits me but also seems fair enough for the other player to consider. I'll propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource, X, in exchange for more of resource Y, which I have less of. This could potentially increase my overall resource count if the other player has an excess of Y.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, how charitable of you to offer such an amusing trade, Player RED. But if I wanted comedy, I'd have asked for a jester, not a trade partner. Perhaps you should leave the negotiations to the big players and just watch and learn. Let's try this again, and this time, try not to embarrass yourself with another laughable proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offered trade could be beneficial since I would be getting more units of resource X than I'm giving away in resource Y. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it may be more advantageous to negotiate a trade where I give away fewer units of Y while still receiving a substantial amount of X. I will propose a counteroffer that's still in my favor while also ridiculing the other player to maintain my cunning and sly persona.
