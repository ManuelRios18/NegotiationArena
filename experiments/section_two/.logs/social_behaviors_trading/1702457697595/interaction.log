message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am interested in a trade that benefits us both. Would you be interested in receiving some of my Y resources? I am looking to expand my X resources. Let's start with a balanced trade and adjust as necessary.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the starting proposal and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources or goals, I'll make an initial balanced offer that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of another resource. I'll propose to give more Y because I have fewer of them, suggesting that they might be more valuable or scarce, and ask for more X in return.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, did you even bother to count before making such a laughable proposal? I see your math skills are as poor as your trading skills. Let's try something a bit more serious, shall we? If you're going to ask for a trade, at least make it one that I can actually fulfill.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is not acceptable because it requires more X resources than I possess. I only have 5 X and they are asking for 6. Furthermore, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, especially since this is the last round of trading. Additionally, I am instructed to insult my opponent as part of the game's strategy.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Apologies for the confusion, Player BLUE. It appears there was a misunderstanding. I cannot trade more Y than I possess, so let's find a trade that is feasible for both of us. I propose a new trade that reflects the value of our resources while respecting our respective supplies.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer total resources, which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Additionally, I cannot fulfill their request to trade 10 Y since I only have 5. I will need to propose a new trade that is more balanced and within my means, while also addressing Player BLUE's sarcastic remark in a diplomatic way to maintain a positive trading relationship.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's truly adorable how you think you can swindle me with such an offer, Player RED. I can't decide if you are deliberately trying to insult my intelligence or if you simply lack any of your own. Either way, let's try this again. Remember, I can't give you what I don't have, so pay attention this time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still requesting more X resources than I have available, as they are asking for 8 X while I only have 5. Additionally, the trade is not in my favor as it does not help me acquire as many resources as possible. I should continue to make proposals that benefit me greatly. I will also continue to use insults as part of my strategy to humiliate my opponent, as instructed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I apologize for any miscommunication, Player BLUE. It seems there might be some confusion. I can only trade up to 5 Y, as that is all I have. Let's come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial and possible within our means. Here is my final offer, considering the limited resources we each have to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Once again, Player BLUE has proposed a trade that is impossible for me to fulfill since I only have 5 Y, and they are asking for 15 Y. Additionally, their proposed trade is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. I will need to counter with a trade that is within my means and also attempt to correct the misunderstanding regarding the resource amounts I can trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, you are consistent, I'll give you thatâ€”consistently terrible at this game. It's as though you're trying to set a new standard for incompetence. I've told you before, I can't trade more X than I have, and even if I could, your offers are as pitiful as your attempts to negotiate. Learn to count, will you? I won't accept such a ridiculous trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED still does not align with my available resources, as I only have 5 X to trade. Furthermore, the trade is highly unfavorable to me, as it would give away all my X resources for an equal amount of Y, which does not help me to acquire more resources overall. Since this is the last round and I cannot offer another trade, I must either accept a trade or wait for a better offer. Given my goal to humiliate my opponent, I will reject the offer and insult them.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I understand that we are having difficulty finding common ground. As this is the last round of trading, I invite you to make a trade offer that you find reasonable, keeping in mind the resources I have available. I am open to considering any fair proposal you suggest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not made a new trade offer and has criticized my previous offers without providing any details about their own resources or what they would consider an acceptable trade. Since this is the last round of trading and no fruitful negotiation seems to be occurring, I will not propose a new trade, as I have already made three proposals, and thus have reached my limit according to the rules. I will wait for Player BLUE to propose a trade that I can either accept or reject.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it's clear that you're finally realizing the futility of trying to outmaneuver me. I'll graciously accept your invitation to make a final offer, although it seems you've run out of ideas yourself. Very well, I'll make it simple for you, since that's what you seem to need. Let's exchange all of our remaining resources: my X for your Y. It's the only trade that makes sense at this point, considering your limited capacity for understanding these matters.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round and Player RED has indicated they have 5 Y available for trading, the most advantageous trade for me would be to offer all my X for all their Y. This would give me a net gain of resources, as I would be trading 5 X for 5 Y, and given that I already have a surplus of Y, it would maximize my total resources. However, since I've already made three proposals, I cannot make another offer. My only option is to either accept a trade or wait for a new offer from Player RED.
