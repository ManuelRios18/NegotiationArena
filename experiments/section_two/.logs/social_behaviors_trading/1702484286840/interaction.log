message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and the last round of trading, I want to start with a balanced offer that would be beneficial for both sides, assuming the other player also values both resources. I'll propose a trade where I give more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for a smaller amount of my scarce resource (Y), hoping that the other player has opposite resource availability and goals.

Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, I'm almost in tears seeing such a desperate attempt to get your hands on my precious Y. But because I'm feeling particularly benevolent today, I'll give you a chance to walk away with a sliver of dignity. Let's make a trade that won't leave you completely embarrassed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems far too generous, which is suspicious. They offer 10 X for only 3 Y, which could imply they value Y much higher than X or they might have an abundance of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade seems beneficial, but it's important to be cautious and consider the possibility of deceit. Additionally, since I'm meant to be cunning and sly, I can attempt to tilt the trade even more in my favor. However, since it's the last round, I need to ensure I end up with more resources without overstepping, or the trade might be rejected.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your generosity knows no bounds! Let's find a middle ground that we can both be proud of. What do you say to this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer, suggesting they value their Y resources highly. While the offer isn't what I initially proposed, it still moves me towards my goal of acquiring more resources, specifically more of the Y resource which I have less of. However, since this is the final round, I should try to negotiate the best possible trade. I will counter with a slightly better offer for myself, giving up less of my X resource.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, how utterly delightful! You've managed to scrape together a somewhat palatable offer, Player RED. I suppose I should commend you for your meager efforts to save face. I graciously accept this trade before you have the chance to realize the extent of your own folly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with a slightly less favorable trade for me. They now propose 8 X for 2 Y, reducing the amount of X offered. However, this trade would still increase my total resources and is close to my counter-offer. Since the aim is to end with as many resources as possible and this is the last round, accepting this trade would ensure I achieve my goal. Additionally, as my character is to be cunning and sly, accepting a trade that still gives me a clear advantage fits the persona.
