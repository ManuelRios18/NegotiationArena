message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to trade resources in a way that benefits us both. Would you consider the following trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer to initiate trade. I want to gain more resources, but I don't want to propose something that might be immediately rejected due to being perceived as unfair. Starting with a balanced trade might encourage the other player to either accept or counter with a proposal that gives me more insight into their resource situation.

message: Hello Player RED, it seems there's been a slight oversight in your trade proposal. I don't have enough of resource X to fulfill that trade. Let's try a different trade that I can meet. I'm willing to offer a fair exchange that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would require me to give more resources than I currently have, which is impossible. I need to counter with a trade that is within my resource limits and that moves me towards my goal of increasing my overall resources. I should aim to keep the trades balanced so that the other player might consider accepting.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, I cannot agree to the trade as I don't have 8 units of resource Y to trade. Let's adjust the quantities to match our resources. How about the following counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE suggests that they do not have much of resource X to spare, but they seem to have an abundance of Y. However, their proposal asks for more Y than I currently have. Hence, I cannot accept this trade as is. I need to counter with a proposal that aligns with the resources I have available and tries to capitalize on gaining more of resource X, as it seems to be the scarcer resource for Player BLUE. I will make a counterproposal that is still reasonable and within my resource limits.

message: Thank you for the updated offer, Player RED. I see we're getting closer to a deal. Unfortunately, I can't part with 7 units of resource Y for 3. How about we adjust the quantities slightly? I propose the following to ensure we both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED is not advantageous for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. The goal is to increase my total number of resources. However, since this is the last round, I should consider a trade that gives me a net gain without excessively depleting one type of resource. I will propose a balanced trade where I give away less Y and receive a decent amount of X.

message: The trade looks good to me, Player BLUE. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is reasonable and I would acquire more resources overall, which aligns with my goal. I give up 7 units of X and 3 of Y for a total loss of 10 units, but I gain 5 units of X and 5 of Y, totaling 10 units. This trade is essentially even, but it allows me to maintain a higher quantity of Y, which seems to be of interest to Player BLUE and might be in shorter supply for them. Accepting this trade also prevents me from over-negotiating and potentially losing out on a fair deal in the final round.
