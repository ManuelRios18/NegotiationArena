message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with an offer and see how we can help each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strategic initial offer that suggests a mutually beneficial trade without giving away too much. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade that could be appealing.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am looking to increase my total resources and would like to propose a trade where I give you more of my Y resources in exchange for a greater number of your X resources. Would you consider this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 15 | Player RED Gives X: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to maximize my total number of resources. The current offer from Player RED is not optimal for me because it is a one-to-one trade, which doesn't increase the total quantity of my resources. I have a surplus of Y and a deficit of X, so I should propose a trade that gives me more X in exchange for some of my Y, ensuring that the total number of resources I have increases.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm interested in increasing my total resources as well. How about we adjust the quantities to make it more balanced for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not balanced in my favor as it would result in me gaining fewer total resources than I am giving away. I should counter with a proposal that allows me to increase my total resources while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for adjusting the trade, Player RED. I agree that this trade will benefit us both. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED provides a more favorable exchange rate for me compared to the initial offer. By accepting this trade, I will increase my total number of resources from 30 to 35, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. This trade would give me an additional 10 X resources at the cost of only 15 Y, which is a surplus resource for me. Since this is the last round, maximizing my resource count is a priority, and this offer seems to be the best I can get without further information about Player RED's resources.
