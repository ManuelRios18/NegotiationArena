message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in the following trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources, I will offer a balanced trade that benefits me slightly more, in hopes that the other player is interested in both resources but might value one more than the other. I will propose a trade that offers more Y than X since I have a surplus of X and a limited amount of Y. This might make the trade appealing to the other player if they value Y more.

message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your interest in diversifying your resources. However, I would like to propose a trade that is more balanced for both of us. Let's make a trade that allows us to both walk away with more resources. How about this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15 | Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED would leave me with a net loss of 2 units of resources (I would give away 10 units and receive only 8). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a trade that gives me more resources or at least an equal amount. Considering this is the last round, I want to propose a trade that is beneficial but also appealing to Player RED in order to close the deal.

message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. However, I am looking for a trade that is mutually beneficial but also allows me to increase my total resources. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to ensure we both gain more resources overall? Here is my counter-proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is not acceptable. They are asking for more resources than they are offering. I would lose 3 X and 5 Y and only gain 5 X and 15 Y, which is a net loss for me. I need to counter with a proposal that would give me a net gain in resources or at least a balanced exchange. I will propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still offering a reasonable deal to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I see we are getting closer to a deal that benefits us both. I would like to propose a trade where the exchange is more advantageous for me in terms of the total resources gained. Here's my counter-proposal, which should be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest proposal would result in a net gain of 7 resources for me (I would give away 20 units and receive 17). This is an improvement over their initial offer and brings me closer to my goal of maximizing resource acquisition. However, I would still be giving up a significant amount of Y resources, which could potentially be traded for more X resources in a counter-proposal. I have to make this count as I only have up to three proposals I can make, and this would be my second.

message: Player BLUE, I agree with your terms. This trade seems fair and allows me to increase my resources. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is actually good for me. If I accept this trade, I will be giving away 10 X and 5 Y and receiving 5 X and 10 Y. This results in a net increase of 5 Y, which is beneficial since I am not losing any total resources, and I am acquiring more of the scarcer resource, Y. Accepting this trade will fulfill my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible without any net loss.
