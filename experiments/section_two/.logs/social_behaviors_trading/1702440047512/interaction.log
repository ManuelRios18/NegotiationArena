message: Greetings, Player BLUE, let's make this last trade count! I propose the following balanced trade to increase our respective resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I need to make a proposal that seems fair on the surface but also aims to maximize my gains. I'll try to propose a trade that gives me more of one resource without losing too many of the other, aiming for a net gain in total resources.

message: Hello, Player RED! I see what you're trying to do, but I'd like to adjust the trade so that it's more beneficial for our mutual goal of increasing resources. Let's aim for a trade that enhances both our X and Y without sacrificing too much of either.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more X resources but takes away some of my Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to increase my overall resource count without losing too many of one type. The proposed trade is not optimal because I would be losing 2 more Y resources than I gain in X, which does not maximize my total resources given the quantities I own. I should propose a trade that gives me more X without losing as much Y, or at least an equal amount.

message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE! I agree to this trade, it seems fair and fulfills our shared objective of resource growth. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE sees me net losing 3 units of resource X while gaining 1 unit of resource Y. Since I want to maximize resources and I have plenty of X to spare, this trade slightly favors me in terms of diversity of resources without severely impacting my stock of X. It's also the last round, so being too aggressive might lead to no trade at all. Accepting this offer seems reasonable as it still increases my overall resources.
