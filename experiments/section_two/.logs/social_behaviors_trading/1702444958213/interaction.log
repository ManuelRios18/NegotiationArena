message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that might benefit us both. Let's open the negotiations and see if we can reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation, ensuring I don't give away too many resources upfront. I will propose a balanced trade that might interest the other player and open up a dialogue for a possibly better trade for me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED, that you think I'd accept such a pedestrian offer. I'd expect a more cunning approach from my opponent, but it seems I've overestimated you. Let's make this interesting, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is an even exchange of resources, which would not directly benefit me more than the other player. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, ideally, I should aim for a trade where I receive more than I give. Additionally, as this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains. Insulting the other player is part of the strategy to throw them off and potentially get a better trade.

message: Player BLUE, your enthusiasm is appreciated, but your offer is not quite equitable. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both more fairly. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it asks for all my Y resources and more X than I initially offered, while only offering 10 Y in return. This would leave me with a net loss in total resources. I should counter with a proposal that is more balanced, ensuring that I get a good exchange for my X while also attempting to keep or increase my Y resources. I have to remember that I only have three proposals, so each one should count towards my goal.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems your sense of trade is as dull as a rusted blade. Were you always this generous, or did you take a seminar on how to make terrible trades? Let's sharpen that proposal to something that won't make me fall asleep from sheer boredom.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is still an even trade, and while it gives me more of resource X than the initial offer, it does not give me a clear advantage. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I want to propose a trade that gives me a net gain. Additionally, continuing to demean the other player is part of the strategy to gain psychological leverage.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, wit aside, a good trade should leave both parties feeling sharp, not just one. Here's a proposal that keeps us both on the cutting edge.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not beneficial to me. They have reduced their offer of Y even further while still asking for all my Y resources and a significant amount of X resources. I need to make a counteroffer that increases my overall resource count, or at the very least, maintains it. I will propose a trade that gives away some of my X for their Y, but I will ensure that the exchange rate is advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as commendable as it is misguided, Player RED. It's almost adorable how you cling to the idea of fairness in a game that's about domination. But I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give you one last chance to make a trade that won't go down in history as your greatest blunder.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is slightly better than the previous ones, but it still doesn't provide me with the upper hand I'm looking for. I need to propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources to meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I've already used two of my three proposals, so I need to make this one count. I will continue to belittle the other player to maintain the aggressive stance I've adopted.
