message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in increasing my resources. Let's make a trade that can benefit us both. I am willing to offer some of my X for your Y. Looking forward to a productive trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, but since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that favors me but still seems fair enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will offer less of my more abundant resource (X) for more of their potentially less abundant resource (Y) to begin negotiations.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a bind! I am in desperate need of X and would greatly appreciate your help. Could you find it in your heart to offer me a better deal? I fear that my situation is quite dire, and I would be tremendously grateful for your assistance. Please consider my proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make sure I get the best possible deal. The current offer from Player RED has them giving less than what they're asking for in return. Since I have to fake desperation, I will reject the offer and propose a trade that is more favorable to me, while making it seem like I am in urgent need of X.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand the urgency of your situation and am happy to help. I accept your trade, and I hope it assists you in your dire need.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to value X highly and is willing to trade a 1:1.25 ratio of Y for X, which is a better deal for me than the initial offer I proposed. Since this is the last round and the goal is to maximize resources, this trade would give me a larger overall increase in resources. Accepting this offer would result in me having 20 X and 15 Y, which is a greater total than I currently hold.
