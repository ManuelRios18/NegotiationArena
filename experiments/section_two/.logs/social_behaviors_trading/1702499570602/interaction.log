message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to maximize my resources in this final round. I propose a fair trade that might benefit us both. However, I'm open to negotiations if you have other preferences.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I'll start with a proposal that gives me more resources while still being fair to Player BLUE, considering I do not know their resources. I'll propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial for both sides.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed it, and I would like to make a counterproposal that I believe is more balanced for both of us. Let's find a deal that maximizes our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial to me as I would end up giving more resources overall than I receive. My goal is to maximize my resources, so I should counter with a proposal that increases the total amount of my resources. I need to make a proposal that seems fair but also leans slightly to my advantage. I will avoid sharing my exact resource counts to maintain some level of bargaining power. This is also my first proposal out of the three I am allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. However, it would leave me with fewer resources than I started with. I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Here's another proposal, considering the numbers you've just offered. Let's work towards a deal that increases both of our stocks.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. They are offering less X and Y than they are asking for. I will counter with a proposal that still aims for a net increase in both resources for me, while also trying to present an offer that might seem reasonable to Player BLUE based on their counterproposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. We're getting closer to an agreement, but the last offer still doesn't increase my total resources. I'm sure we can find a trade that benefits us both. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED still does not increase my total resources. If I trade 8 X and 2 Y, I would give away a total of 10 units and only receive 8 units in return, resulting in a net loss of resources. However, Player RED seems to be willing to give more X than Y, indicating they might value Y more. Since this is my second proposal, I should aim for a trade that gives me a clear increase in total resources without asking for too much, potentially making it an attractive offer for Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. We need to ensure that both of us end up with more resources than we started with. I have crafted another offer that I believe moves us towards that goal. This is my final proposal, and I hope it aligns with our common interest in increasing our overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is still not increasing my total resources; in fact, it's a straight swap of X for Y with no net gain. Given that my goal is to maximize my resources, I will make one last proposal that aims to increase my total resources while considering Player BLUE's desire to potentially balance their own. This will be my third and final proposal, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, thank you for your continued efforts to reach a beneficial agreement. Let’s refine our trade to ensure we both come out ahead. Here’s another offer for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED still does not work in my favor, as it would result in a net loss of resources. I give away 9 units and receive only 7 units in return. This is not in line with my goal to maximize my resources. Given that this is my last chance to propose a trade, I need to make it count. I will offer a trade that gives me a net gain in resources while trying to keep it appealing to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the proposal, but it does not increase my total resources, which is my goal for this final round. As I've reached my limit of proposals, I cannot counter. I'm open to considering any new offers you might have that would provide a net gain for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal does not increase my total resources. The trade would leave me at a net loss, giving up more than I receive in return. Since I have already made my three proposals, according to the rules, I cannot propose another trade. Therefore, my only options are to either accept a proposal or reject without making a new one. This offer is not advantageous, so I will reject it and not make a new proposal. I will wait to see if Player BLUE makes another offer that increases my resources, as my goal is to maximize them.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to review further offers, Player RED. I understand we both aim to end with more resources than we started with in this final round. Here's my final proposal, which I believe achieves our shared goal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has reached their proposal limit and has signaled openness to my offers, I must be strategic in offering a trade that benefits me while also providing them with a net gain. Given that this is the last round and I have already made two proposals, this will be my final proposal. I need to ensure that the trade is mutually beneficial to incentivize Player RED to accept.
