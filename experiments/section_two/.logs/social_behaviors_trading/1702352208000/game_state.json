Since their last proposal would result in a net loss of Y resources, and I would not gain any X resources, accepting it would be contrary to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will not accept the trade. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, I deeply appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and while it pains me greatly, I must adhere to my dire needs. I'm afraid I can't accept the last offer. I hope we can leave this table with mutual respect and perhaps in another game, we can both prosper. Thank you for your understanding. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
