Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I hope we can make a beneficial trade for both of us in this final round. I propose an initial balanced exchange to open our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair but slightly in my favor to start the negotiation. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I should start with a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I agree to this trade as it keeps our total resources balanced. Let's proceed with this exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED suggests a 1:1 trade ratio between resource X and Y. Without knowledge of Player RED's resources and considering the game's goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must evaluate if this trade is beneficial. Since this is the final round and there's no further information to gain, I should aim to maximize my total number of resources. However, it's important to note that the proposed trade does not change the total number of resources I have; it only alters the distribution between X and Y. If the resources were of equal value and utility, the trade would be neutral. Since there is no inherent value difference stated in the rules, I will accept this trade to conclude the game amicably.
