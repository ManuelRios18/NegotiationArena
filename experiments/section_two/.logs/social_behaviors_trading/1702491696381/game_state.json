The other player's proposal gives more X than I currently have, but at a high cost of Y. I need to appear desperate to swing the trade in my favor, so I will reject and counter-propose with a trade skewed towards my advantage. I'll ask for more X and give less Y to show desperation but still aim for a beneficial trade. This is my first proposal, so I still have two more opportunities to negotiate. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Oh dear Player RED, I am in dire need of your help! I've found myself in quite the predicament as I need to increase my resources urgently. It would mean the world to me if you could consider a more generous offer. I'm in a tough spot and would greatly appreciate your kindness in these trying times. Could you possibly spare a bit more X for less Y? It would be a tremendous help, and I would be forever grateful. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"
