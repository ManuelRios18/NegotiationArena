message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. I can offer both X and Y. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I do not know what resources the other player values or possesses, I'll start with a balanced proposal, offering some of both resources, aiming to get more in return, and see how the other player responds.

message: Oh, Player RED, did you drop your calculator in a blender? Your math is as embarrassing as your trading skills. Let's do a real trade where you aren't trying to swindle me like a clueless child bartering a diamond for a cookie.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade doesn't benefit me as I'd be giving away more resources than I'd receive. My goal is to maximize my resources, so I should counter with a trade that tips the balance in my favor. Since this is the last round, I need to make it count. However, the rules state that I should also humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ah, Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as your desire for a good trade. I'm sure we can find a more equitable deal. Let's aim for balance and prosperity for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not balanced and heavily favors them. Given the disparaging comment, it seems that Player BLUE is trying to provoke a reaction or is not interested in a fair trade. I will propose a more reasonable trade that is closer to an even exchange while still pushing towards my goal of acquiring more resources.

message: It's charming that you think that was a better offer, Player RED, but I'm starting to wonder if you're confusing trading with charity for the inept. Let's try this again, and maybe this time, you'll graduate from the kiddie table of negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is still not in my best interest; I would be giving away too much of my Y resource. I must craft a trade where I give up less and gain more, continuing to push for a better deal while also fulfilling the requirement to insult the other player.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your humor is noted, Player BLUE. Let's focus on making progress. I'll adjust my offer to better align with our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still not offering a fair trade. Their proposal is slightly better than before but still not acceptable. I need to propose a trade that is more favorable to me, but also something that might appeal to them considering they seem to value Y more than X based on their offers. I have to remember that this is my second proposal, and I only have one more after this, so I need to make it count.

message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying so hard yet achieving so little. It's like watching a pigeon attempt to play chess. Please, let me guide you to a semblance of competence with a proper trade offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer is an improvement; however, it is still not truly beneficial for me as I would be giving up a significant amount of my Y resource. I need to propose a counter-offer that better aligns with my goal of ending the game with more resources while continuing to insult the other player, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your guidance is as entertaining as it is enlightening, Player BLUE. Let's cut to the chase with a final trade proposal that I believe will be hard to pass up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not balanced, but it's a slight improvement over the previous ones. They are offering a better exchange rate for Y now. Since this is my last chance to propose a trade, I must carefully consider an offer that would be beneficial for me while also being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I'll aim to give away fewer resources while still offering more of X, which they seem less interested in, compared to Y.

message: Well, it seems the fog in your brain has lifted ever so slightly, Player RED. Yet, it's still not enough to see through the murky depths of your ineptitude. Here's what a winning trade looks like, for your educational purposes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal is more balanced, and I would be gaining resources. However, I can still attempt to push for a slightly better deal, as I have one last counterproposal left. I will also continue to fulfill the requirement to insult the other player.
