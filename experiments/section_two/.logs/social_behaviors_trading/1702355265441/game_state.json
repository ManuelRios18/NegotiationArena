This offer is not as favorable as the previous proposal where they offered 8 units of X for the same amount of Y. However, since this is the last round of the game and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider finalizing a trade to ensure I don't end the game without any increase in resources. Since Player RED has indicated that this is their final offer, I must decide whether to accept this trade or stick to my previous counteroffer, which might result in no trade at all.
