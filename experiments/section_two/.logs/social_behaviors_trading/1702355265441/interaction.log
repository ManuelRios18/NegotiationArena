message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in making a trade that benefits us both. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my total resource count. I will start by offering a balanced trade to see how Player BLUE responds, which will give me insight into their resources and goals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am interested in trading, but I'm looking for an offer that would be more balanced. How about we adjust the quantities a bit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of the game, I need to make a trade that maximizes my resources. The current offer from Player RED is a straight exchange of 5 units of X for 10 units of Y. Given that I do not have information on the relative value of X and Y, I must consider that they might have equal value. In this case, I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving. Therefore, it makes sense to either negotiate a better trade or propose a trade that is more favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. How about we adjust the ratio to reflect the scarcity of Y resources? I believe the following trade could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not ideal for me, as it does not increase my total resource count. I need to propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still appearing fair to Player BLUE. I will propose a trade that gives me a better ratio of Y resources for my X resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the updated proposal, Player RED. I appreciate the improved ratio. However, I'd still like to see if we can reach an even more equitable exchange. Would you consider this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer is an improvement over their initial offer. They're now willing to give 8 units of X for 10 units of Y. This trade is more favorable to me than the first one, but there's still room for negotiation to try to get the best possible deal, especially since I have not yet used any of my three proposals. I should attempt to get an equal exchange or one that is more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE, and I appreciate the negotiation. Here's my final offer, which I hope you will consider fair. It's the best exchange I can provide while maintaining a beneficial trade for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has returned to their initial counteroffer, which still does not increase my overall resources. Since I have only one proposal left before I can only ACCEPT or NONE, I need to make it count. I will make a final offer that slightly increases my resources while still providing a good exchange rate for Player BLUE, hoping they might find it acceptable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your patience and your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your final offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is a trade of 7 units of X for 10 units of Y. This offer is not as favorable as the previous proposal where they offered 8 units of X for the same amount of Y. However, since this is the last round of the game and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider finalizing a trade to ensure I don't end the game without any increase in resources. Since Player RED has indicated that this is their final offer, I must decide whether to accept this trade or stick to my previous counteroffer, which might result in no trade at all. Taking into account that I am trying to maximize my resources and that I would still be gaining 2 more units of X than I currently have, it might be in my best interest to accept this offer.
