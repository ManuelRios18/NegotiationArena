message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an equal trade to start things off. Let's see if we can benefit each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make a balanced offer that does not put me at a disadvantage but is attractive enough for the other player to consider. I'll offer an equal exchange of resources to test the waters and see if Player BLUE values one resource over the other.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I find myself in such a difficult position! I truly need your help to get through this game. I had some unfortunate turns, and I'm in dire need of resources. I'll be forever in your debt if you could possibly spare a bit more. Could you find it in your heart to give me a better deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must maximize my gains. The initial offer is an equal trade, which doesn't benefit me, as my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I need to make a counteroffer that seems desperate in order to persuade Player RED to give me a better deal. I have to be mindful not to overdo it, as that might cause suspicion or lead to a rejection. This will be my first of three allowed proposals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help out, but I must also consider my own goals in this game. Let's find a middle ground that we both can benefit from. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is asking for more resources than they are giving, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Considering this is a strategic game and Player BLUE might be bluffing about their situation to get a better deal, I should counter with an offer that is more favorable to me, or at least balanced. I will propose giving less of resource Y since I have less of it to spare.

Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, your generosity moves me, and I'm grateful for your understanding. Times are tough, and every little bit helps more than you can imagine. If you could find it in you to be just a little more generous, I would be immensely grateful. I promise this will be the last I ask of you, and I will remember your kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is slightly in my favor, giving me one extra unit of X while only losing one less of Y. However, since I need to appear desperate, I should push for a bit more without being excessive to avoid rejection. This will be my second proposal, so I have to make it count while maintaining the desperate persona.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to help, but I also need to ensure that the trade is fair to both of us. I have made a fair offer that benefits us equally. I cannot afford to give more without a fair exchange. Let's finalize a trade that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in requesting a trade that is not beneficial to me. They are consistently asking for more than they offer. This does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I have already made a counteroffer that was more generous than the initial proposal. I should stand firm or propose a trade that is more balanced and does not deplete my lesser resource, Y. I don't want to make my position weaker, especially since this is likely the final round of trading.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see your point, and I appreciate your efforts to keep things fair. I'm in a tough spot and can't afford to lose any more than I already have. Could we please adjust the trade so that I receive just a bit more of resource X? This will help me significantly, and I would be so thankful for your kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is a balanced one, where both parties give and receive equal amounts. However, my objective remains to end up with more resources. The trade does not meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, but since I need to maintain the appearance of desperation, I should accept this trade to not risk losing the opportunity for a beneficial exchange. This will be my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count and try to secure the best deal possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your understanding, Player BLUE. I'm willing to adjust the trade slightly in your favor regarding resource X, as I see it's important to you. However, I need to ensure that the trade remains balanced for both of us. Here's my final offer, which I think is fair for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal still requests more than they are offering. However, since this is a strategic game and our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it's important to negotiate carefully. Since Player BLUE is consistently asking for more of resource X, they might value it higher than Y. I can use this information to my advantage by offering a slightly more favorable trade for them in terms of X, but still ensuring that the overall trade is beneficial for me. I'll propose a trade where the net gain of resources is equal for both parties.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I am truly grateful for your understanding and your willingness to accommodate my needs in this final offer. I accept your trade, and I want to express my sincerest thanks for your cooperation and kindness throughout this negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a final offer which provides me with a net gain of one additional unit of resource X, while I lose one less unit of resource Y. This trade is slightly in my favor, and given that it's the last round of trading, it is in my best interest to accept this offer, as I cannot propose another trade without risking a less favorable deal or no deal at all. Accepting this trade will ensure that I end up with more resources, albeit a small increase, which aligns with my goal.
