message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Let's make a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should propose a balanced trade that is likely to be accepted, while still increasing my overall resource count. I'll propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while giving up some of the other, maintaining a balance that is attractive to both sides.

message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is almost adorable. Do you really think I would fall for such a pedestrian offer? I'm not some schoolyard novice you can swindle with your feeble numbers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last trading round, I must ensure that any trade I make results in a net gain of resources. The proposed trade from Player RED offers 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of Y. This would leave me with 15 units of X and 10 units of Y, a total of 25 units. However, if I propose a counteroffer that's more skewed in my favor, I can potentially end up with more than 25 units overall. Additionally, as per the instructions, I'm supposed to humiliate my opponent as much as possible, although I might want to avoid going too far and causing them to end negotiations.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's aim for a trade that's fair and beneficial for both of us. How about we adjust the numbers slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it asks for more of my X resources while offering fewer Y resources in return. It's important to negotiate a more balanced trade that increases my total resource count without giving up too much of a single resource. Since I have more X resources, I can afford to give some up but should ensure that I receive a proportionate amount of Y resources. I will propose a trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio to make it more appealing and fair.

message: Player RED, it's almost as if you're trying to make me laugh. Equivalence is a concept for those who lack ambition. I'm not here to participate in a charity exchange. You should be honored to have the opportunity to trade with me, so let's not pretend your offer is anything but laughable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is now more balanced, offering an equal amount of X for Y. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 17 units of X and 13 units of Y, which is still a total of 30 units, equal to what I started with. I could potentially accept this offer since it is equal, but since this is the last round and I'm supposed to humiliate my opponent, I should attempt to push for a trade that gives me a greater advantage. This is my second proposal; I should aim to make it count.

message: Player BLUE, while I respect your negotiating tactics, we must find common ground. Let's make a trade that respects both our ambitions. I'm willing to offer a substantial amount of X for a fair amount of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is even less favorable than the previous one, offering fewer Y resources for a significant amount of my X resources. The trade is not balanced and does not meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is a strategic game and the last round, I need to be firm yet open to negotiation to reach a beneficial trade. I will counter with a proposal that gives up X resources for a better Y return, aiming for a balance that may appeal to Player BLUE's desire for X resources while still increasing my total resource count.

message: Oh, the audacity! Player RED, your attempts at bartering are as pitiful as a child's lemonade stand. It's clear you lack the acumen for this level of play. I'll give you one last chance to redeem yourself with a trade that befits my stature.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a more favorable offer, but it's still not the best deal I could potentially get. Accepting this offer would give me 17 units of X and 15 units of Y, totaling 32 units. This is a net gain of 2 units overall, which is a slight improvement. However, I have one last proposal that I can make, and I should use it to push for the best possible deal. I must also continue with the aggressive and humiliating strategy as directed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's conclude our negotiations with a trade that reflects the shrewdness you clearly possess. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE continues to be unfavorable, with an even lower return of Y resources for a high cost of my X resources. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of increasing my overall resource count. As we are at an impasse and this is my last proposal, I need to consider that rejecting this offer might result in no trade at all, which would leave me with my current resources. Therefore, I will make a final offer that is more balanced, yet still shows willingness to part with a reasonable amount of X for a decent return of Y. If Player BLUE declines this offer, I may have to consider accepting their next proposal if it is more reasonable or end the game without a trade, maintaining my current resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: At last, Player RED, a glimmer of sense shines through your otherwise murky understanding of trade. I accept your proposal, but don't think for a moment that you've outwitted me. I've merely allowed you this minor concession to spare you further embarrassment.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal offers me a reasonable trade, with a total sum of resources that exceeds my current holdings. Accepting this trade would result in 15 units of X and 16 units of Y, giving me a total of 31 units, which is a net gain of 1 unit overall. Since this is the last round and I have already made my maximum number of three proposals, I can no longer propose new trades. Therefore, accepting this offer is the best course of action to increase my total resources, even if only by a small margin.
