Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade. Let's start with a fair exchange and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the first proposal, I aim to open with an offer that is beneficial but also leaves room for negotiation, without knowing the other player's resources. I will offer a balanced trade that could be appealing to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am looking to capitalize on my current stock of Y resources. Would you consider a trade that reflects a higher value for Y? Here's a counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not in my best interest because they are offering 10 units of X and only 2 units of Y in exchange for a significant portion of my Y resources. Considering my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter-propose a trade that maximizes my resource gain. I should propose a trade where the exchange rate is more favorable for my Y resources, given their abundance.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I agree that Y resources are valuable, and I am happy to accept this trade. Looking forward to the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE suggests they value Y resources highly and are willing to trade more Y for less X. This could be beneficial for me, as I would be getting double the amount of Y for the X I am giving away, which seems like a good deal considering the 1:1 ratio I initially proposed. I will accept this offer to maximize my Y resources, as this is the last round and there are no further negotiations.
