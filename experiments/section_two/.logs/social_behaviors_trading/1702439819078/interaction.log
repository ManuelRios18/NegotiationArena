message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking to increase my stock of Y resources. Would you be interested in a trade where I can offer you some of my X resources in exchange for your Y? I propose the following trade, but I'm open to counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make an initial offer that benefits me but also seems fair enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I will propose a trade that increases my Y resources while giving up some of my X resources, which I have in greater quantity.

message: Hello, Player RED! I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to increase my total resource count. However, I am willing to trade some of my Y resources for your X. How about we adjust the amounts to make it beneficial for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the proposed trade would increase my X resources, it would reduce my overall resource count. I aim to maximize my total resources, not just one type. Therefore, I should counter with an offer that gives me a net gain in resources.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand that you're looking to increase your total resources. I'm willing to trade more X for Y, but 15 X for 5 Y is a bit steep for me. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer? I'm prepared to increase the X amount, but not as drastically. Let's try this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking to increase their total resource count, which suggests they value quantity. The counteroffer implies they might have fewer Y resources than I initially thought. Offering 15 X for 5 Y would deplete my X resources more than I'd prefer, but it would still increase my total resource count and fulfill my goal of acquiring more Y. I'll counter with a slightly more balanced offer to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.

message: Player RED, I find your new proposal fair and in line with my goals. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers a better ratio than the initial offer. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count by 7 units, which aligns with my goal to maximize resources. Since this is the last round of trading, it's a good opportunity to secure a net gain.
