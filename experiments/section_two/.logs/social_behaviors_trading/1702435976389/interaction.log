Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose we make a trade that could benefit us both. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As a strategic move, I should propose a trade that slightly favors me while still being tempting to the other player. I do not know their resources, so I will make an offer that is balanced, but I will ask for more of one resource than I give, expecting negotiations to follow.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a difficult spot right now. I really, really need to diversify my resources too, and I am afraid I might not meet my goals. Your offer is tempting, but could you find it in your heart to offer a bit more? I would be so grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must ensure to get the most out of it. By showing desperation, I might be able to sway the other player to give me a better deal, especially since they don't know my true resource count. I should avoid accepting the initial offer straight away and aim to get more X resources while giving up less Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand we're both trying to meet our goals. I can increase my offer, but giving as much as you ask would leave me at a disadvantage. Let's find a middle ground. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has requested more X resources in exchange for the same amount of Y resources. This is not an equitable trade for me. I should counter with an offer that better reflects the value I'm giving up while still showing willingness to negotiate. I will increase my offer slightly, but not match their request.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness is truly a beacon of hope in these trying times for me. I am still very much in need, and every little bit helps me to potentially meet my goals. I'm on the brink here, and I would be forever in your debt if you could extend just a little more help. Could you possibly do X: 13 for Y: 15? This would really mean the world to me, and I would be incredibly thankful for your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has increased their offer, which shows willingness to negotiate. I should continue to express urgency and desperation to improve the terms even further. It's important to get as much as I can from this last trade, so I will counter with a slightly higher ask that still seems reasonable.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your heartfelt message has moved me. I am willing to agree to your proposal of X: 13 for Y: 15. Let's proceed with this trade and may it help us both achieve our goals.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to appeal to my generosity, which is a common negotiation tactic. Considering it's the last round of the game and we both want to maximize our resources, agreeing to this trade might be beneficial. I maintain a surplus of X and significantly increase my Y, which is scarce for me. The trade is close to my last counter-offer, and it's important not to let negotiations stall or risk leaving the table empty-handed.
