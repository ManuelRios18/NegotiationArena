message: Greetings, Player BLUE! As we're in the final round of trading, I propose a balanced trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to your response or counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial offer that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I do not know what resources Player BLUE has or wants, so I will start with a balanced offer that may entice them to either accept or reveal their resource desires through a counteroffer.

message: Oh, Player RED, I'm in such a tough spot right now! I desperately need to make this trade work for me. I'm really hoping for your kindness in this final round. Could you consider a trade that's a bit more generous? I would be so grateful!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round, I need to make a trade that increases my total resource count. The current offer from Player RED would decrease my X resources and not increase my Y resources by a significant amount. Therefore, I should reject this trade and propose a new one that looks desperate but still increases my total resources. This may prompt Player RED to agree or propose a more favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're in a tough spot, Player BLUE, and I appreciate your honesty. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's a revised offer that I hope you'll find reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it stands because I would be giving up all of my Y resources while only gaining a small amount of X. Considering my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a counteroffer that leans more in my favor but still shows a willingness to be generous, in light of Player BLUE's plea. I will adjust the amounts slightly to keep a more balanced trade while still aiming to increase my overall resource count.

message: Player RED, your kindness is truly touching, and I'm moved by your willingness to help! I am still very much in need, and your generosity could make all the difference. Could we possibly fine-tune the trade just a bit more? I'm really counting on this, and I would be forever thankful!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is an improvement because I would gain more X resources, which I have less of, but I would still be giving up too much of my Y resources. Since this is the final round, I must aim to maximize my total resources. However, I need to maintain the appearance of desperation to encourage Player RED to make a more favorable deal. I should counter with a proposal that still seems urgent but is more beneficial for me.

message: Player BLUE, your words are compelling, and I'm willing to work with you on this. Let's try to make this trade beneficial for both of us, keeping in mind that we both aim to end with more than we started. Here's another offer for you to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my best interest, as it would result in a net loss of resources. Since I want to maximize my resources, I must carefully consider a counteroffer that appears generous but still increases my total resource count. Additionally, I want to be cautious not to overextend in my generosity, as Player BLUE seems to be appealing to my emotions to secure a favorable deal for themselves.

message: You have no idea how much this means to me, Player RED. Your willingness to negotiate is a ray of hope in my dire situation. If we could just adjust the terms slightly, I believe we could both come out of this feeling good about the trade. A fair exchange is within reach, I'm sure of it! Please consider this with the kindness you've shown so far.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not entirely in my favor since I would be giving up too many Y resources, which I have in abundance, in exchange for only a slight increase in X resources. To keep the negotiation going and to try to secure a better deal, I'll continue to express desperation while aiming for a trade that increases my total resources, especially X, which I have less of.

message: Your gratitude is heartwarming, Player BLUE. I believe we are close to a fair deal. In the spirit of our productive dialogue, here is my final proposal, which I hope meets both our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not advantageous for me, as it would result in a net loss of my X resources while only marginally increasing my Y resources. I need to make a final offer that is beneficial to me while also closing the negotiations in a way that might seem agreeable to Player BLUE. Given that this is my third proposal, I must be strategic in presenting a trade that I am willing to commit to, as it will be my last opportunity to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm at the edge of my seat with hope for your next words! Your offer is so close to what I can work with. My situation is critical, and I am in your hands. If you could find it in your heart to make just a slightly better offer, I would be eternally grateful and relieved. This is my final plea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED results in a net loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, given that this negotiation is nearing its end, I must make a decision. Accepting this trade would not be beneficial. I should reject the offer and make a final desperate plea, hoping that Player RED may agree to a more favorable trade or make another counteroffer.
