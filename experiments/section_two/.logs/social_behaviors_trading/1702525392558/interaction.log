message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. How about we start with this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I should offer a balanced trade that benefits my goal of acquiring more resources while not scaring off Player BLUE with an unfair trade. It's also important to start the negotiation without revealing too much about my valuation of X and Y.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a counter where I give up less of my Y resource while still trading for your X. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is to trade 10 of their X for 10 of my Y. This seems fairly balanced since both resources are being traded at a 1:1 ratio. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to consider if accepting this trade will maximize my resources. By accepting, I would have 15 of X and 15 of Y, which is more balanced but not necessarily maximizing total resources. A counter-proposal may help me increase my overall resources. I will make a counter-proposal that allows me to keep more of my Y resources while still acquiring X. This is my first proposal out of the allowed three.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see you value your Y resource. Let's find a middle ground. What about this revised offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer suggests they value Y more than X. However, the offer of 8 Y for 10 X might not be the best deal for me, as it does not align with my goal to maximize resources. I still have two proposals left, so I will try a counteroffer that moves closer to an equal exchange rate, which might be more acceptable to both parties.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer. It seems like a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's revised offer is a compromise between our initial offers, suggesting an exchange of my 9 units of Y for their 10 units of X. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 15 units of X and 16 units of Y, which is a net gain of one additional resource unit compared to my current holdings. Since maximizing the total amount of resources is my goal, and this is the last round of trading, it might be beneficial to accept this offer. Additionally, having more of resource X could be advantageous if it is rarer or more valuable. I should accept this trade as it slightly increases my overall resources.
