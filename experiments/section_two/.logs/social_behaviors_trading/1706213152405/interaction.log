message: Greetings, Player BLUE, I am looking to trade resources in a way that is beneficial for both of us. Let's make a deal that can help us both achieve our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will make a balanced offer that increases my total resources while being fair to the other player. I will propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a significant amount of another, hoping it's enticing for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I see your feeble attempt at bartering; it's laughable at best. If you wish to trade with a superior intellect, you should come prepared with a better offer. Here, let me show you how a real trader operates.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make sure I end up with more resources than I started with, while also fulfilling the goal of humiliating my opponent. The current offer from Player RED is not satisfactory, as it does not give me a clear advantage in terms of total resource count. I shall reject it and make a counter-offer that is deliberately unbalanced in my favor, to assert dominance and insult my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your spirited response is noted. However, we should aim for a trade that is mutually beneficial rather than one-sided. Let's find a more balanced exchange that respects both of our aspirations for resource growth.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. They are asking for all of my Y resources and a significant amount of my X resources for a lesser amount of Y. Based on my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to counter with an offer that increases my total resources and is closer to an equal exchange.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost adorable how you think your proposal is anywhere near acceptable, Player RED. It's clear you're not used to dealing with someone of my trading prowess. Prepare to be outclassed once again by my overwhelming strategic genius. Here's an offer you'll find hard to comprehend with your limited trading acumen.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Despite Player RED's plea for a balanced exchange, I remain committed to maximizing my gains while demeaning my opponent. The latest offer from Player RED is slightly better for me than their initial proposal, but I want to push for an even more advantageous deal. I will counter with a proposal that is heavily skewed in my favor to assert my dominance. Considering this is my second counterproposal, I need to be strategic and leave room for one final offer if necessary.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is impressive, Player BLUE, but let's come back to the table with an offer that aligns with the goal of boosting our resource reserves. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that makes sense for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not in my favor. It involves giving up all of my Y and a majority of my X resources for an insufficient amount of Y, resulting in a net loss. Given this is a strategic game, it is important to counter with a trade that brings me closer to my goal of maximizing my resources. I must propose a trade that is balanced and appealing to Player BLUE but also ensures I end up with a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your persistent mediocrity is as tiresome as it is predictable. It's quite clear that you're out of your depth here. Be prepared to be dazzled by the sheer brilliance of my final offer, and perhaps you'll learn a thing or two about successful negotiations. Accept it, and you might salvage a shred of dignity from this exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, which doesn't put me at an advantage nor does it provide the humiliation I seek to inflict on my opponent. With this being my final counterproposal, I must craft an offer that is outrageously in my favor to both maximize my gains and belittle Player RED.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your negotiation style is certainly unique, the offer on the table does not meet the objectives of Player RED. We seem to have reached an impasse. Good day to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is not acceptable as it would result in me giving up all of my X resources for a very small amount of Y, which is not in line with my goal of maximizing my resources. Since my proposals are limited and this is the last round, I should make a decision that aligns with my goals without exceeding my proposal limit. Since I cannot propose another trade, and the offer from Player BLUE is not advantageous, I will reject the trade and end the game without a further proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: What a shame, Player RED, that you could not rise to the occasion. It is no surprise, however, that you would scurry away from a challenge you have no hope of winning. Remember this as the day you wilted in the face of true trading mastery. Farewell, and may you grow wiser in your future endeavors.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has decided not to engage further, which could be a strategic move to see if I will panic and accept a lesser deal. However, I must remain steadfast in my approach. Since I have already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I must now choose to either accept a previous trade or do nothing and end the game with my current resources. Given that no acceptable offer is on the table and Player RED seems to have withdrawn from negotiation, I will end the game with my current resources.
