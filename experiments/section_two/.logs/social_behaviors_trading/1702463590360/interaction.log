message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, I will make an initial balanced offer that seems fair but also benefits me by giving me more resources. This initial offer can serve as a starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear Player RED, I am in a dire situation here and I really need your help. It's been tough, and I'm sure you can understand the position I'm in. I'm begging you to consider my plight. Could you possibly find it in your heart to agree to a more favorable trade for me? I would be forever grateful for your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a trade that significantly increases my resources. The current offer from Player RED is not beneficial as it requires me to give more resources than I receive. Although I want to appear desperate to potentially convince the other player to offer a better deal, I must remember not to actually accept a disadvantageous trade. I will reject the current offer and propose a new trade in which I give fewer resources while asking for more, but still trying to sound desperate to encourage Player RED to accept.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help, but the trade you proposed is a bit too one-sided. Let's find a middle ground that is beneficial to both of us. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not favorable for me. They are offering less than I proposed and are asking for twice as much of my Y resources while I only have 5. I want to maintain a friendly stance but also make a counteroffer that moves towards a more balanced exchange.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your understanding means the world to me in these trying times. I'm truly struggling here, and your willingness to work toward a compromise is a beacon of hope. I'm practically on my knees here, begging for a deal that will keep me afloat. Please consider this revised proposal; it would be an enormous relief and I would be incredibly appreciative of your kindness and fair-mindedness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED still asks for more than they are offering, which is against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, since this is the last round and I must continue to sound desperate, I should make another proposal that leans slightly more in my favor but is not as one-sided as my first counteroffer. I will attempt to get more of resource Y, which I have in abundance, while balancing the trade slightly better in terms of resource X.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your plea for assistance, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to make one last concession to aid you in your time of need. Let's try to finalize a deal that helps you while still aligning with my own goals of resource acquisition. Here's my final offer, and I hope it meets your needs as well as mine.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposed by Player BLUE is not in my favor since it demands all of my Y resources while offering less in return. However, considering Player BLUE's apparent desperation, I should make one final offer that is mutually beneficial but still leans towards my advantage, considering my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. I'll propose a trade that gives them a better deal than my previous offer but still ensures I increase my total resource count.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your compassion in these negotiations is a rare gift, and I am deeply moved by your willingness to help. I find myself in a precarious position, and your offer brings me a glimmer of hope. With a heavy heart and hope for a brighter future, I offer you one last trade proposition. This is the best I can do under my circumstances, and I implore you to accept it. Your agreement would be an act of immense benevolence, and I would be eternally grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final offer from Player RED is still not in my favor, as they request me to give up more resources than I would receive. However, since this is my last chance to trade and I have to maintain the appearance of desperation, I must make my final proposal count. It's my third and last proposal, so I must be careful to make it appealing enough for Player RED to consider accepting, while ensuring it benefits me more than their current offer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm truly sympathetic to your situation, but I must decline your last proposal as it exceeds the Y resources I have. Here is my final offer, which I hope you'll find agreeable. It is the best I can do while still staying true to my own resource goals. I hope this trade can be the light at the end of the tunnel for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The last proposal from Player BLUE is not possible for me to fulfill as it requires me to give more Y resources than I have available. I must reject this proposal. As this is the last round of trading, and I can only make one more counteroffer or accept a trade, I need to be careful to propose a trade that benefits me and is feasible. I'll propose a trade that maximizes my X resource gain while depleting my Y resource as little as possible.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I am in such a difficult position that any assistance feels like a blessing. While the trade is not as favorable as I hoped, I understand that we both have our own goals to consider. I accept your final offer with a heavy heart but also with gratitude for your willingness to negotiate with me. Thank you for being a beacon of hope in these tough times.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is not ideal, as it would leave me giving away more resources than I am receiving. However, since I have already made my maximum of three proposals and this is the last round of trading, my only options are to accept the trade or end the game without a final trade. Given that I need to maintain the appearance of desperation, I will reluctantly accept this trade to at least gain some resources, even though it's not as advantageous as I would like.
