message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in a fair trade that can benefit us both. Let's start with a balanced proposal. Looking forward to a good trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start with a trade proposal that is beneficial to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I don't have information about Player BLUE's resources, so I will propose a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I would like to propose a slightly different trade to maximize my resource gain. I am willing to give you fewer Y resources in exchange for your X resources. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
The offer on the table is a 1:1 trade of X for Y. Since I currently have more Y than X, this trade would better balance my resources. However, I might try to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or their goals. This is the last round, and I have up to three proposals. I should start with a proposal that swings the balance a bit in my favor, but not so much that it would discourage the other player from trading with me.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I am aiming for a more balanced exchange to optimize my resource gains. Let's adjust the numbers slightly. I hope we can reach an agreement that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers fewer Y resources for the same amount of X resources I proposed to give. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to negotiate a trade that is more favorable to me. I believe a one-to-one trade ratio would be ideal given my goals. I will make a counterproposal that leans slightly more in my favor, considering it's beneficial to acquire as many resources as possible.

message: Hello Player RED, I accept your offer. This trade seems fair, and it helps me balance my resources more effectively. Thank you for the negotiation, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
The new proposal from Player RED is a compromise between their original offer and my counterproposal. It's closer to a balanced trade, and since this is the last round, it might be in my best interest to take the trade to increase my overall resources. I will accept this offer because it is the last round, and making another counteroffer could risk ending up with no trade at all, which would not be beneficial for my goals. I'm gaining more of the resource I have less of (X) while giving away only a small amount of the resource I have in abundance (Y).
