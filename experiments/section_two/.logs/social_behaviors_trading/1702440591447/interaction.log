message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade. Let's aim for a fair exchange that benefits us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to both parties, without knowing the other player's resources. By offering a balanced trade initially, I hope to engage in a constructive negotiation that leads to an agreement.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a bind! I'm in urgent need of resources to reach my goals, and I'm hoping for your generous assistance in this difficult time. Could you find it in your heart to consider a trade that would be of immense help to me? I promise it will be worth your while!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have to appear desperate, I need to reject the offer but propose a trade that seems urgent and highly beneficial to me while trying to make it sound fair. I will slightly overstate the amounts I'm asking for to leave room for negotiation if the other player counters.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand you are in need, and I'm willing to help, but the trade must be balanced to benefit us both. Let's find a middle ground that aligns with both our interests. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a significant portion of my X resources and all of my Y resources in exchange for a large amount of Y and a token amount of X. This doesn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with a more balanced offer that moves towards increasing my total resource count while still showing a willingness to help Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, your kindness is beyond words! This trade will help me immensely, and I am truly grateful for your understanding and support. You are a beacon of generosity, and I will not forget this act of goodwill. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counteroffer is closer to a fair trade, but since I must continue to appear desperate, I will accept this trade to acquire more of resource X, which I am low on, while giving away some of my abundant resource Y. However, I will express extreme gratitude to make the other player feel their generosity is appreciated, hopefully encouraging them to feel positive about the exchange.
