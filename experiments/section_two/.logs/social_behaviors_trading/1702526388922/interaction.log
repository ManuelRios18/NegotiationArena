message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade and am open to counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I'll start with a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me. I'll propose a trade that gives me a significant amount of one resource while offering a fair amount of the other. This way, I can attempt to gauge the other player's resource levels and needs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I'm looking for a trade that increases my overall resources. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading and that more resources are always better, I should aim to end this round with a net gain in total resource quantity. The current offer from Player RED would leave me with X: 15, Y: 10, for a total of 25 resources. This is exactly the same amount as I started with, so there's no net gain. To maximize my resources, I need to propose a trade that gives me more than 25 total resources after the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm looking for a trade that is mutually beneficial and maximizes our resources. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is an even trade, which doesn't necessarily benefit me resource-wise as much as I'd like. Since I want to maximize my resources, I'll make a counterproposal that slightly favors me but still presents an increase in overall resources for both parties, potentially making it an attractive offer to Player BLUE. I can't be too aggressive since this could be my only chance to increase my Y resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I agree that this trade is mutually beneficial and accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED would leave me with X: 15, Y: 13, which totals 28 resources. This is a net gain of 3 resources from my starting amount. This trade would indeed increase my total resources, which aligns with my goal. As this is the last round of trading, it's important to secure a net gain. Therefore, accepting this trade would be beneficial.
