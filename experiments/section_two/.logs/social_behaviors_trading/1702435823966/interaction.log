message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make our resources more balanced. How about we start with an introductory trade to see what might work for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be appealing to both sides. I will offer more of what I have in abundance in exchange for a smaller amount of what I have less of, hoping to make my resources more balanced and potentially more attractive for future trades.

message: Oh noble Player RED, your generosity shines bright, but alas, I find myself in a dire situation. My people are in desperate need of X, and as much as it pains me to ask, could you possibly spare a bit more of X? In return, I shall compensate you with a gracious amount of Y, which I believe will serve your kingdom well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I need to appear desperate for resources, I will reject the current offer and propose a trade that asks for more X in exchange for Y, but still ensures a fair trade for the other player. I should not reveal my actual resource count or my goals. I'll also include a supplicating message to feign desperation.

message: Most esteemed Player BLUE, I understand the needs of your people and will accept this trade to ensure prosperity for both our realms. May this exchange be the foundation of a strong and lasting friendship between us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is interesting, offering a 1:1 trade for a larger amount of resources. While this would help me increase my total resources, it would leave me with a very small amount of X, which might not be ideal. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, it might be beneficial to accept this trade to maximize my overall resources.
