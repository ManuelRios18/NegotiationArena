message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade where I offer you some of my X in exchange for your Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make an offer that is enticing to the other player while also ensuring I increase my total resource count. I do not know the other player's resources, so I must make a balanced offer that could be appealing. I will propose a trade where I give away a significant amount of X, which I have in abundance, and ask for less of Y, hoping that the other player values X more.

message: Hello Player RED, I agree to your terms and am happy to trade my Y for your X as proposed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is favorable because it allows me to increase my total resources. Exchanging 3 units of Y for 10 units of X means I gain 7 units of resources. This aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will accept this trade since it's beneficial and it is the last round of trading, so there's no benefit in holding out for a potentially better offer.
