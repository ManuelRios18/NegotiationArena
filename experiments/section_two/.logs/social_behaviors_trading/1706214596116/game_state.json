Nevertheless, it's a better ratio for resource exchange than their initial offer. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my gains. I will counter with a better offer that still leans heavily in my favor. This will be my second proposal, and I will still have one more opportunity to propose a trade if needed.\n</reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> \nOh dear, Player RED, it seems you are as clueless as a child lost in the woods, stumbling about with offers that barely scratch the surface of my expectations. While I commend your attempt at progress, it is still miles away from a trade that could be considered reasonable. You must understand that I am not just any common trader, but a master of resource acquisition. Lift your gaze higher, and perhaps you'll catch a glimpse of the lofty standards you need to meet.\n</message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2 </newly proposed trade>"

Since this is the last round of trading, it is critical to maximize my gains. This is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and I should make it count. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly less in my favor than the previous one, hoping to entice Player RED to accept, while still maintaining a strong advantage.\n</reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> \nAh, Player RED, you are persistent, I'll grant you that. It is almost a quality to be admired, if it weren't so pitifully paired with your inability to grasp the gravity of our negotiations. Your 'final offer' reeks of desperation and a misguided sense of equity. I suppose I shall extend you one final kindness, a generous offer that you should crawl over broken glass to accept. Consider it a parting gift from the benevolent monarch of resource trading that I am.\n</message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3 </newly proposed trade>"
