message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade, but feel free to counter-offer if it doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources or needs, I will start by making a balanced offer that gives me a profit in one resource while losing some of the other. This way, I can open a dialogue and adjust my strategy based on their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, that offer is as disappointing as your strategy seems to be. You must be joking if you think I'd accept such a pitiful deal. I thought you were here to trade, not to hand out charity to yourself. How about you give me a real offer, or are you too scared to make a trade that actually requires you to think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED does not align with my goals of humiliating the opponent and trying to acquire as many resources as possible. They are offering a 2:3 trade ratio, which is not bad, but I believe I can push for a better deal under the guise of countering while insulting them to fit the humiliation aspect of my goals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as your trading skills are keen. Let's find common ground. I propose a trade that reflects a more balanced exchange between our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is not in my favor, as it would give up more of my abundant resource without providing a proportional return in the scarce resource. I should propose a counter-offer that leans more towards an equal exchange while still aiming to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems your idea of balance is as skewed as a one-legged pirate on a stormy sea. Do you need a pair of glasses to see how uneven this trade is? But because I'm in a generous mood, I'll give you another chance to redeem yourself from this embarrassment of a proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is slightly better than the previous one, but I can still attempt to insult them and improve the terms even more to my favor. This will be my second proposal, so I should make it count. Since this is a game of cunning and humiliation, I should continue with the same tone.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your humor is as appreciated as a good trade. Let's make this count. Here's an offer that should quench your thirst for fairness and valor.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is still not ideal as it demands a high amount of my X resources for a lower amount of their Y resources. However, considering this is the last round of trading and I have a significant surplus of X, I might consider a trade that is slightly in their favor to increase my Y resources. I will make one final balanced proposal, and if they decline, I will consider accepting a less favorable trade to ensure I don't end up with an excess of a single resource.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I'm almost moved by your attempt at courage, but it's still as lackluster as a candle in the sun. Do you even understand the art of trading, or are you just throwing numbers hoping they'll stick? Let's wrap this up with a trade that might actually be worth my time, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a better offer, increasing the amount of resource X they are willing to give while decreasing the amount of resource Y they are asking for. However, I still have one more proposal I can make to push for an even better deal, exploiting the strategic advantage to the fullest and maintaining the tone of humiliation as per the given instructions. I will make my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable, and your colorful commentary has been quite the spectacle. Let's conclude our spirited trading with the deal on the table. I accept your offer. Until our next game of wits and trades, fare thee well!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE still seeks a high amount of X in exchange for a relatively low amount of Y. However, since this is the last round of trading and I must consider the fact that no trade could leave me with an unbalanced surplus, it may be beneficial to accept a less advantageous trade to diversify my resources. I've used two of my three proposals, so I need to decide carefully. I can accept this trade to ensure I gain some Y resources or make my final proposal in an attempt to get a slightly better deal. Given the diminishing returns in the negotiation, I will accept the trade to ensure I do not end up with a surplus of one resource and too little of the other.
