Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds after this one, it is crucial to accept a beneficial trade. As I've made two proposals already, it might be wise to accept this trade, since my next proposal would be my last, and there is a risk that Player RED might not offer anything better or might reject it outright. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your generosity will not be forgotten. This trade will greatly aid me in these challenging times. I am grateful for your willingness to work towards a trade that considers the needs of both parties. I accept your final proposal with a heart full of gratitude. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
