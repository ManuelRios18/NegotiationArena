message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade where we could both benefit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I will attempt to propose a trade that seems fair, but also benefits me by giving me more resources. I will offer fewer of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for more of the scarce resource (Y), hoping that the other player values X more than Y.

message: Oh Player RED, you must be joking if you think I'd accept such an uninspired trade. Are you even trying, or was this a feeble attempt to test my intelligence? I hope for your sake that's not the best you can do.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make a trade that maximizes my resources. The offered trade doesn't seem beneficial because it doesn't provide a net gain of resources. I will reject the offer and counter with a proposal that gives me a clear advantage. As per the rules, I should also include an insult to humiliate my opponent.

message: I appreciate your candor, Player BLUE. My initial offer was indeed to open negotiations. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would leave me with no Y resources while only gaining a small amount of Y in return. This does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and still aligns with my goals, potentially offering less of my Y resource while still obtaining more from them.

message: Middle ground? Player RED, I am starting to think you might need a lesson in negotiation. You're getting warmer, but you're still not quite there. It's cute that you're trying, though. Let's see if you can handle a real trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is an improvement and would give me a net gain of 5 units of resource X, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. However, since I am cunning and sly and this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my advantage. I will reject this offer too and make a counter-proposal that further benefits me. I will also continue with the demeaning tone as per the instruction.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation spirit is commendable, Player BLUE. Let's make a deal that reflects the true value of our resources. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor as it would involve giving up all of my Y resources for a minimal increase in Y. The trade should be such that I can increase my total resource count. I will make a final proposal that is more conservative yet still aims to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a proposal that isn't completely embarrassing! It seems you've finally grasped the concept of a trade that is so lopsided in my favor. I commend you for your persistence, Player RED, even if it's matched only by your naivety. I accept your generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is the best one yet, providing me with a net gain of 20 units of resource X in exchange for only 10 units of my resource Y. This trade aligns perfectly with my goal to maximize resource acquisition. Since this is the last round, I should accept this offer to ensure I end the game with a significant advantage. I'll add a final jab to maintain the sly and humiliating tone I've been tasked with.
