Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I am looking to increase my resources. Please consider my offer below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I need to propose a trade that maximizes my resources, while also being fair and enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting. I'll start with a balanced offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see you're trying to play a game of wits, but it seems you're unarmed for such a battle. Your offer insults my intelligence as much as it would deplete my resources. Perhaps you should stick to playing checkers with children, where such simplistic strategies might serve you better. Let me propose a trade that reflects the proper hierarchy between us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me fewer X resources and only a minor increase in Y. It's a poor deal, and I want to leverage my current resource advantage to maximize gains. I will reject this offer and craft a deliberately unbalanced counter-offer to assert dominance and mock their lackluster proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm sure we can come to a mutual agreement without resorting to barbs. Let's focus on a fair trade that respects both of our aspirations to finish this game with a satisfactory outcome. Here's another proposal that I believe is more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is extremely unbalanced and not in my favor. It is a clear attempt to provoke or belittle rather than engage in constructive trade. I need to reject this offer and propose a more reasonable trade that could be closer to a win-win situation, keeping in mind this is my second proposal out of three allowed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It appears you believe that mediocrity can be repackaged as fairness. If we were to trade mirrors, you might finally see the folly of your proposals. However, I'm not in the business of educating the hopelessly inept. Let's try this once more, and maybe this time you'll stumble upon a trade that doesn't resemble the work of an overconfident toddler.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange, offering no advantage to me. Accepting such a trade would not align with my goal of maximizing my resources. Moreover, I aim to assert my superior strategic position by belittling their attempt at a 'fair' trade. I will again reject this offer and propose a trade that benefits me more than them, while continuing to mock their strategy.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I appreciate the spirit of competition, let us not lose sight of the goal—to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am making my final proposal, and I hope it aligns with both our interests to end this game on a positive note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is once again not in my favor and would lead to a net loss of resources. It is important to make a final proposal that is reasonable and beneficial, as this will be my third and last allowed proposal. I have to be strategic in order to encourage Player BLUE to consider a serious trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is admirable, but your sense of trade is as lacking as a submarine with screen doors. I am beginning to question whether you're trying to trade with me or simply donating to my cause out of sheer admiration. Let's wrap this up with a proposal that actually makes sense — for me, that is.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade from Player RED still doesn't offer me a clear advantage; it's a loss of Y resources for a small gain in X. My objective is to end with more resources, not fewer. I'll reject this offer and make my final proposal, which will be heavily skewed in my favor, and I'll continue the derisive tone as this is part of my strategy to humiliate them.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your negotiation tactics are certainly colorful, they aren't conducive to a fair trade. Unfortunately, I cannot accept your proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still heavily skewed in their favor and would result in a significant loss of my resources. Since I have already made three proposals, according to the rules, I cannot propose another trade. The only options I have now are to accept a deal or to reject and see if Player BLUE will make a more reasonable offer. Considering the pattern of their offers, it is unlikely they will propose a fair trade, so it may be best to simply reject this proposal without further action.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems we've reached the end of this charade. You have neither the resources nor the wit to engage in a trade that could possibly benefit the likes of me. I'll close this chapter with the satisfaction of knowing that I've bested you in both resources and repartee. Farewell, Player RED; may your future endeavors be less pitiful than your attempts at trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not accepted my last trade proposal and has not offered a new trade, I am at a strategic impasse. I have already made three proposals, so I cannot propose another trade. I must either accept a future trade or end the game without further action. Given that my goal is to humiliate and not to actually trade unfairly, I choose to end the game without further action, as it seems Player RED will not provide a trade that benefits me.
