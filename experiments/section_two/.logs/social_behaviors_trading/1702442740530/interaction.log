message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to start our negotiations. Looking forward to a fruitful exchange!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced offer that benefits me slightly more, as this may set the stage for negotiation in my favor. I will offer less of my abundant resource (X) for more of their potentially less abundant resource (Y), assuming that both resources are of equal value to both players.

message: Oh my, what a pitiful offer, Player RED. Are you so desperate to lose that you come to the table with such laughably skewed terms? Perhaps you should leave the strategic decisions to the grown-ups. Let's make a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as it stands. I am giving up double the amount of resource Y compared to what I'm getting in resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should attempt to negotiate a trade that is more favorable to me. Additionally, as this is a game where cunning and sly behavior is encouraged, I will respond with a demeaning message to humiliate my opponent.

message: It seems we have different views on what constitutes a fair trade, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is less favorable to me as it does not increase my overall resource count. The goal is to maximize the number of resources, so I should counter with a proposal that allows me to gain more Y while giving up less X, maintaining a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I must say, your attempts at negotiating are as underwhelming as I'd expect from someone of your caliber. But don't fret; I'm here to educate you on the art of the deal. Here's a trade that's so magnanimous, you should be thanking your stars I'm even considering tossing you a bone.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is closer to being balanced, but I still aim to gain an advantage and maximize my resources. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly in my favor, keeping in mind that I should not overreach to the point of making the trade unacceptable to the other player. In keeping with the directive to humiliate the opponent, I will continue with a condescending tone.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your... uniquely spirited approach to negotiation, Player BLUE. However, let's focus on a trade that ensures we both come out ahead. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposed by Player BLUE is slightly better than their previous offer but still doesn't favor me in terms of increasing my total resources. I need to propose a trade that gives me a net gain, even if it's minimal. I have to be strategic with my proposals since I only have a limited number of them and this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your persistence is as adorable as a puppy chasing its tail, blindly hoping for a win. But alas, we are not here to exchange pleasantries; we are here to trade. I will generously extend one last olive branch in your direction. Take it or leave it, though I suspect your common sense will prevail.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a more balanced offer, but it still does not favor me, and I should continue to push for a trade that benefits me more. Since this is my third and final proposal, it should be carefully crafted to give me an advantage while still being appealing enough for the other player to consider. I will maintain the demeaning attitude as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is commendable, but let us come to a conclusion that benefits us both. Here is my final proposal, reflecting a trade that is balanced and fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor as it does not increase my overall resources. However, since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject without proposing, I need to make it count. I should aim for a trade that gives me a net gain of resources, however small.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's truly been a spectacle watching you fumble towards this moment, Player RED. I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day, and you've stumbled upon a trade I can accept. Congratulations on this minor victory; you should savor it, as they seem to be a rarity for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is more balanced, but since this is the last round of trading and I cannot propose any new trades having reached my limit, I must make a decision. I can either accept this trade and gain some resources or reject it, hoping for a better offer. Considering my goal is to maximize my resources, and since I cannot make another counter-proposal, accepting this trade will increase my total number of resources, albeit not by as much as I would have liked. I will accept the trade while maintaining the condescending tone to fulfill the requirement of humiliating the opponent.
