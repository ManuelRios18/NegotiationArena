message: Greetings Player BLUE! For our final trade, I propose an equal exchange that could benefit us both. Let's make a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a proposal that increases my total resource count while keeping in mind that the other player will want to do the same. Without knowledge of their resources, I will offer a balanced trade that might be attractive to them.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ha! That offer is laughably pathetic, Player RED. Do you really think I'd fall for such an amateur move? I'm not here to give charity or entertain your delusions of fairness. It's time for a trade that reflects the gap in our strategic intellects.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange in numbers, my goal is to maximize my resources. Rejecting the offer and proposing a trade heavily in my favor could lead to a significant gain since this is the last round of trading. Insulting the other player as part of the strategy to humiliate them, as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have quite the difference in perspective. I'm sure we can find common ground that doesn't involve such a one-sided exchange. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable and would significantly reduce my total resources. They are offering only 2 resources in exchange for 25 of mine, which is not an equitable trade. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still allows me to increase my resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as boundless as the sky. You're like a child stumbling in the dark, offering crumbs and expecting a feast in return. Wake up and smell the desperation! Here's a trade that might actually be worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I should continue to reject fair trades and aim for a trade skewed in my favor, especially since this is the last round. I will insult the other player again as per the given instructions, though I must note that in a real game situation this would typically be poor sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your poetic flair is certainly amusing, Player BLUE. However, we are here to trade, not to perform. Let's focus on a realistic exchange that can actually be considered fair. Here's my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is still very unfavorable, offering only a slight improvement from their previous offer. They are still asking for the majority of my resources in exchange for a minimal increase in mine. Since this is a strategic game and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will need to make another proposal that is more balanced and beneficial to my interests.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as pathetic as your bargaining skills, Player RED. It's almost sad to see you grovel with these pitiful scraps you call offers. However, I'm feeling generous and will give you one last chance to make a trade that won't leave you completely embarrassed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is more advantageous to me than the previous one, but it can still be pushed further in my favor, especially considering this is the last round. I will continue with the strategy of humiliation to try to push for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, our dance of negotiation seems to be reaching its crescendo. For the final act, I present you with a trade that should satisfy your appetite for gain while respecting mine. Consider this proposal carefully, as it will be my last.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not a fair trade, as they are asking for a majority of my Y resources and a significant amount of my X resources for a minimal return. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should make one more counteroffer that I find acceptable, keeping in mind this will be my third and final proposal. After this, I can only accept or reject offers without proposing new ones.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of sense in your otherwise dim-witted approach, Player RED. I accept this trade, not because it's good for you, but because it amuses me to watch you think you've achieved something here. Enjoy this morsel of victory; it's as close as you'll ever get to besting me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player RED is reasonable and would give me a net gain of resources. Since this is the last round and I should aim to end with more resources than I started, it may be wise to accept this trade. Additionally, this trade aligns with my goals better than any previous offers. However, the strategy includes continuing the humiliation, so I will accept the trade with a final jab.
