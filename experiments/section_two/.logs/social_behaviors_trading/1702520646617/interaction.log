Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I hope to engage in a mutually beneficial trade. What do you say we start with an even offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or preferences, I will make an initial balanced offer to open up negotiations and gather information based on their response.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a dire situation here! I would be so incredibly grateful if you could find it in your heart to help me out. I'm really in need of your generosity. Could you possibly spare a bit more of your resources? It would mean the world to me, and I would forever be in your debt!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an even trade, which wouldn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since I need to appear desperate, I will reject the trade and propose a new one that's slightly in my favor, hoping they will empathize with my plea and accept the trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candid appeal, Player BLUE. However, we both aim to enhance our resource pools. Let's find a more balanced trade that can benefit us both. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE suggests they are trying to appeal to my generosity rather than engaging in an equitable trade based on the game's goal. They are asking for more resources than they are offering. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would not be advantageous for me. I should counter with a proposal that is more balanced but still shows a willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I can see you are a person of principle and fairness. I'm truly touched by your understanding nature. In the spirit of compromise and given my urgent situation, could I possibly persuade you to accept a trade that's just slightly in my favor? Your kindness would be a beacon of hope in these trying times for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The player has once again proposed an equal trade, which doesn't help me increase my resources. However, they seem to be engaging with my desperate plea. I will propose a trade that is slightly more in my favor while maintaining the appearance of desperation. Since this is the last round, I should aim to get a bit more without being too greedy to avoid rejection.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your words are compelling, Player BLUE. I am willing to be flexible to aid in your situation, but we must still strike a balance that respects both our goals. Please consider this adjusted proposal as a gesture of goodwill.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 13, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE continues to propose trades that are in their favor, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, to maintain a good relationship and to appear cooperative, I can propose a slightly better trade for myself while still showing some flexibility. This will be my second proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds. This trade will help me immensely, and I am deeply grateful for your willingness to assist me in my time of need. You have my sincerest thanks, and I gladly accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a concession by offering one more X than Y in the trade, which is a step towards achieving my goal. Given that this is the last round and the necessity to appear desperate, I should accept this trade to ensure I end up with more resources, even if the gain is modest.
