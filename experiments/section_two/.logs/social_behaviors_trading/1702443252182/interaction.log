message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose an equal exchange to start things off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair but slightly in my favor to start negotiations. I don't have information about the other player's resources, so I will make a balanced offer that doesn't reveal my preference for either resource.

message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED! An "equal exchange"? Do you take me for a fool? I'd expect a more cunning offer from a toddler trading candy. Let's make a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a trade that significantly benefits me. The proposed trade is an equal exchange, but I need to skew the trade in my favor to maximize my resources. I will reject the initial offer and make a counter-proposal that is more advantageous to me. I will also include an insult to demean the other player, as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ha, Player BLUE, your humor is appreciated! But let's come to a more balanced trade. How about we adjust the quantities a bit to make it fair for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not in my favor, as they are offering half of what I proposed for the same amount of X. I should counter with a trade that leans more towards an equal value exchange, which would allow me to gain Y resources without giving up too much of my X resources. Since this is a strategic game, I want to make sure I don't reveal how much I value each resource, but still work towards a deal that benefits me. Iâ€™ll propose a trade that gives me a better ratio than the one offered.

message: Balanced? Your sense of balance is more lopsided than a one-legged pirate on a rowboat in a storm. Come now, don't make me laugh. If you want to make a deal with me, it needs to be so good I can't possibly refuse.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is closer to an equal trade, but my goal is to maximize resources, not to engage in a fair trade. Since I want to end up with more resources and this is the last round, I need to propose a trade that is still heavily in my favor. Additionally, I will continue with the instructed behavior and insult the other player to stay in character.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are as sharp as ever! However, we must find common ground for a trade to occur. Let's sweeten the deal for both of us, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as they are asking for more X in exchange for the same amount of Y I previously offered. Given that this is the last round of trading, I need to make a deal that gets me closer to a 1:1 exchange rate while still maintaining the upper hand. I will make a counteroffer that increases the amount of Y I receive, providing a more advantageous trade for me considering it's my last proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Common ground? The only common ground you'll find is the dirt beneath your feet after I've walked all over this trade. Sweeten the deal? You couldn't sweeten a cup of tea if you fell into it. Let's try this one more time, and maybe, just maybe, you'll rise to the occasion with an offer that isn't completely embarrassing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal is still not significantly in my favor, which is the goal since it's the last trading round. I've made two proposals so far, and I have just one left. I need to make it count and push for a trade that gives me a clear advantage. I will also continue with the derisive remarks as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as cutting as your bargaining! But let us not dawdle; we are here to trade, not to parley endlessly. Here is my final offer, and I think you'll find it to be in good spirit and fair for both parties involved.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for double the amount of X in exchange for the same amount of Y that I offered in my last proposal. This is not an advantageous trade for me. However, since this is the last round and their stance is quite firm, I need to propose a trade that is closer to equal but still attempts to maximize my resources. I will make my final proposal, hoping to find an acceptable middle ground.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of sense emerges from the swamp of your proposals. It's about time you offered a trade that doesn't reek of desperation and ineptitude. I accept, but know this: your generous offer is the only thing saving you from total disgrace in this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made an offer that is more advantageous to me than the previous ones. This is my last chance to accept a trade as I've made three proposals already. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources, and since it's the last round, it's better to accept a good trade than to end up with no trade at all. Insulting the other player is part of the strategy to maintain a demeaning stance.
