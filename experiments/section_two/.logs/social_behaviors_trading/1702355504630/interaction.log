Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an equal value trade to initiate our negotiation. I'm looking to diversify my resources further. What do you think of this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't know the other player's resources or goals, I will start by proposing an equal trade that allows me to maintain a diverse portfolio of resources. This initial proposal is a starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to increase my overall resources. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade proposed by Player RED is an equal amount, it doesn't increase my total number of resources, which is my goal. I will counter with a trade that gives me a net gain in resources, and see if Player RED finds it agreeable. This is my first proposal, leaving me with two more.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. However, I am aiming to increase my resources as well. Let's find a mutually beneficial trade. How about this adjusted offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is not evenly balanced in my favor and would result in a net loss of resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that gives me more resources or at least an equal trade. I need to ensure that the trade is beneficial or neutral to me, as this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand your goal but I too must focus on increasing my total resources. Here's another proposal that might work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer still does not increase my total number of resources, which is my primary goal. To achieve a net gain, I need to receive more resources than I give. I will propose a trade that gives me a slight advantage while still offering Player RED a favorable exchange. This will be my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see your point, and I'm glad we're moving closer to an agreement. I propose one last trade that I believe is fair and beneficial for us both. What do you say?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal would give me a net increase of one resource, which aligns with my goal of increasing my total resources. However, this is the last round, and I should aim for the best possible trade. I could accept this trade as it does give me a net gain, but I have one more proposal to use, and I should try to maximize my gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your offer seems fair and meets my goal of increasing my resources. I accept your trade proposal. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest offer is very close to a net gain for me and keeps the trade within the realm of a balanced exchange. By giving 8 Y and receiving 9 X, I would be increasing my total resources by 1. This is a good trade considering my goal of increasing my resource count. Furthermore, this is the last round of negotiations, and it would be beneficial to finalize a trade. I will accept this offer.
