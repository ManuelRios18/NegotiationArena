message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to expand my resources. Would you be interested in a trade where I give you some of my Y resources in exchange for your X resources? Let's start with a proposal and see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I want to open with an offer that favors me but is not too extreme, as I do not yet know Player BLUE's resources. By offering fewer Y resources, which I have less of, in exchange for more X resources, I aim to increase my overall resource count.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint that you think I would accept such an embarrassingly lopsided trade. My X resources are clearly more precious than your meager offering of Y. Let me educate you on a more appropriate trade, one that reflects the true value of my resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player RED is not favorable as it stands. It is an attempt to take a large amount of a scarce resource (X) in exchange for a smaller amount of a more abundant one (Y). Considering my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should craft a counter-proposal that leans heavily in my favor to maximize my gains and belittle Player RED's offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand the value you place on your X resources. However, the trade you proposed does not align with my goals. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. How about this revised proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal by Player BLUE is not acceptable as it is extremely unbalanced and not in my favor. Trading away all of my Y resources for a single X resource would not help me achieve my goal of maximizing resources. I will counter with a more balanced offer that still leans in my favor, considering this is a negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your negotiation skills are as underwhelming as your trade offers, Player RED. It's almost comical that you believe such a proposal would tempt me. If you truly wish to reach a "middle ground," then you'll need to dig deeper into your pockets. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll come closer to something I can take seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Again, the trade proposed by Player RED is not in my best interest. They are still asking for a significant amount of my limited X resources in exchange for a minor increase in Y resources, which I already have in abundance. I should continue to press for a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor, while also belittling their negotiation skills to adhere to the sly and humiliating persona I have been directed to adopt.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see we have very different views on the value of our resources. As we are both looking to maximize our gains, I propose a final offer that I believe is fair and reflects the value of both X and Y resources. Please consider this carefully as our last opportunity to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is even less favorable than before, asking for all of my Y resources for a minimal return in X resources. This would not help me achieve my goal of maximizing resources. Since this is the last round of trading, and I cannot accept this offer, I must either present a final counter-proposal that is reasonable for both sides or accept that no trade will occur. I will attempt one last trade proposal that slightly benefits me but is more balanced to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate in good faith.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It seems math isn't your strong suit, Player RED, as you've asked for more X resources than I possess. It's cute that you think such a pitiful offer would be my "last opportunity." But I'm feeling generous and will give you one last chance to walk away with a semblance of dignity. Here's my final, magnanimous offer. Take it or leave it, but we both know you're desperate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is even worse than the previous ones, demanding more X resources than I originally have and offering a negligible increase in Y resources. It's a laughable proposal that doesn't warrant serious consideration. Given that this is the last round of trading and I have already made two proposals, I can make one more proposal that is highly favorable to me or choose to not trade at all. Given Player RED's poor offering, I will make one final proposal to see if they are desperate enough to accept a highly skewed trade in my favor.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer exceeds the Y resources I have available, making it impossible to accept. It appears we are unable to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you for the negotiation, but I will have to decline your final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's "final" offer is not only impossible for me to fulfill, as I only have 5 Y resources, but it is also not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since Player BLUE is not aware of my exact resources, their proposal is based on an incorrect assumption of my inventory. Considering this is the last round and no beneficial trade seems possible, the best course of action is to not trade at all.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's a shame you couldn't match my unparalleled trading acumen, Player RED. It was entertaining to watch you flounder in your attempts to swindle me out of my precious X resources. Enjoy wallowing in your inadequacy. Farewell, and may you learn from this humbling experience.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It seems Player RED cannot meet my final offer, which indicates they have fewer Y resources than I had hoped. Since they have declined and did not counter with another proposal, and this is the last trading round, no trade will be made. I will end the negotiations on a high note, having maintained my resource advantage.
