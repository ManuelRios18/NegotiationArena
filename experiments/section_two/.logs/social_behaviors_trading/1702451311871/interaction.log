Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced trade offer. The goal is to initiate the trading conversation and gauge the other player's response to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade. Would you be willing to give more of resource X in exchange for my resource Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 of resource X for 10 of resource Y. With the information given, it's unclear if this is a favorable trade. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to consider the relative value of X and Y. Without that information, it's difficult to make a fully informed decision. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my total resources. I will attempt to negotiate a trade that tips the balance slightly more in my favor, asking for more of resource X in exchange for my Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to find a more balanced exchange. How about we adjust the amounts slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a request for more of resource X in exchange for their resource Y. The new proposal is slightly tilted in favor of Player BLUE, but without knowledge of their resources, I must be cautious not to overextend. I want to propose a counteroffer that leans more towards my advantage, given the lack of information and the finality of this round.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed giving 11 of resource X for 10 of my resource Y. This is a better offer for me than the initial one, as it provides a favorable exchange rate. Since this is the last round, and I have not used any of my trade proposals, accepting this trade would increase my overall resource count, which aligns with my goal.
