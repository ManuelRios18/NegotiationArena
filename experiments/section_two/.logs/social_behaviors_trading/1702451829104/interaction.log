Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I propose an initial trade, hoping it will be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that doesn't reveal too much about my valuation of the resources. This initial offer could serve as a starting point for negotiation and give me an insight into the other player's resource situation based on their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer. However, I would like to propose a trade that I find more equitable. Let's work together to find a beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources than I would be receiving. The trade should be balanced or in my favor to consider acceptance. I should propose a trade that allows me to gain more resources while giving away fewer resources, considering this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I find the proposed trade is not quite balanced. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here is my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not equitable as they are offering significantly less than what they are asking for, especially considering my limited amount of resource Y. A counter-proposal should correct this imbalance while still encouraging further negotiation. I need to propose a trade that is more in my favor or at least balanced. Since this is my second proposal, I must be strategic and not give away too many resources while still making the trade attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your attempt to find common ground. Let's continue to negotiate to find a fair trade for both of us. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED still requires me to give up more resources than I receive. The numbers proposed by Player RED would cause me to lose 2 X and 2 Y overall, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will make a counteroffer that is slightly more in my favor while still being reasonable in the hopes of reaching an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. However, it would leave me without any of my Y resources. Let's try this offer as a final attempt to reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 11, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable because it would completely deplete my Y resources while offering a poor exchange rate for X. The goal is to increase my total resources, not to diminish them. I need to make a final proposal that maintains a good balance of resources and leaves room for acceptance without further negotiation since this is my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I understand your concerns, and I want to ensure we both benefit from our final trade. Let's adjust the terms slightly. Here's my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is better than the previous ones but still requires me to give up more resources than I would gain, specifically 1 more X and 2 more Y. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to make a trade that increases my total number of resources. I will counter with a trade that is more balanced.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your final offer. Let's proceed with the trade as it offers a net gain in resources overall.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is interesting, but it doesn't result in a net gain of resources for me. It would give me a surplus of Y while depleting my X. Since I've already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade, but I can either accept this offer or wait for a potentially better one. However, since this is the last round, rejecting this offer without a counter-proposal would end the game without a trade. While the trade is not ideal, it does give me more of the scarcer resource Y. Accepting the trade would be in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, even if it's not the most favorable exchange rate.
