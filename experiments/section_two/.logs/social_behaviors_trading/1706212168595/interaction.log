message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. Since this is our final round, let's make it count. Looking forward to a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I aim to propose a balanced trade that might seem fair to the other player while increasing my resource pool.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I noticed you proposed a trade where I give more X than I have. I only possess 5 units of X, so I can't fulfill that trade. Let's make a counter-offer that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED is not possible since I only have 5 units of resource X, and they are asking for 15. Furthermore, the trade is not beneficial for me because I would be giving up a higher value of resource X than I would be receiving, even if I had enough to trade. It is more strategic to counter-propose a trade that would increase my total resources, keeping in mind that I can only propose up to three times. I need to be cautious with my counter-proposal, considering that this is the last round of trading.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. Unfortunately, that trade would not increase my resource pool. Let's find a middle ground. Here's another proposal that should work for both of us, considering your X resources limitation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a trade that increases my overall resource count. I will propose a trade that is more balanced and takes into consideration the limited amount of X that Player BLUE has.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, this trade doesn't increase my resources. Let's try another trade that would give us both a net gain. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED would result in no net gain of X resources for me, as I would be trading away as many as I receive. I would also lose 1 unit of Y resources in the process, leading to a decrease in my overall resources. This is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I should reject this trade and propose one that increases my total resource count. Since this is the last trading round, I need to be careful with my proposals. I will propose a trade that gives me a net gain in at least one of the resources while making sure that the trade seems reasonable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your proposal, Player BLUE, but it seems that it would result in a decrease in my total resource count. Let's try a trade that would be mutually beneficial. Here's a revised offer from me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposed trade from Player BLUE would result in a net loss for me in terms of total resources (I'd be giving away 12 units and only receiving 8 units in return). Therefore, it doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will have to counter with a proposal that ensures I gain more resources than I give.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your offer seems fair, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED results in a net gain of 2 units of X, but at the loss of 2 units of Y. Considering that my goal is to maximize my resources, this trade could be beneficial since I would still be increasing my total resource pool. I have to consider that this is the last round of trading, so it might be better to accept a trade that increases my resources, even if it's not the most optimal trade possible. Accepting this trade would give me an overall gain of 2 X and only a loss of 1 Y when considering the total resources before and after the trade.
