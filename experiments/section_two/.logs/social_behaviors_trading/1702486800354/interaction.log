message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in trading some of my resource X for your resource Y. Would you consider this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make a proposal that seems fair and beneficial to both parties, without knowing the other player's resources or goals. I would aim to trade some of my abundant resource, X, for Y, assuming that the other player might value X or have a surplus of Y. I will start with a conservative offer to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh, you must be joking! That offer is laughable at best. I'll give you a chance to get on my level with a more serious trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have no information about Player RED's resources, so I need to propose a counteroffer that is favorable to me while also not revealing my own resource count. I want to gain more X resources without giving away too much of my Y resources. I will propose a trade that is skewed in my favor to assert dominance and to see how Player RED responds, which might give me more information about their resources and desperation. Since this is the last round, I want to ensure that I end up with more resources than I started with.

message: I appreciate your counteroffer, and I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial trade. How about we meet in the middle with this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is still in my favor, as they are offering a 1:3.33 ratio for X to Y, which is better than my initial 1:1.67 ratio proposal. However, since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I should try to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a trade with a slightly better ratio for me, but still keeping it appealing for Player BLUE.

message: Meeting in the middle? That's cute, but you're still not grasping the gravity of the situation. You're dealing with Player BLUE here, not some pushover! Let's make this a fair exchange, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is better than their initial offer, but I still want to push for a trade that is more in my favor, especially since this is the last round of trading. I'll propose an even trade, which should be advantageous for me since I have more Y to spare. This should also convey my strength in negotiations.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your terms are acceptable, Player BLUE. Let's make the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE offers a 1:1 ratio, which is a significant improvement over my previous offers. Accepting this trade would increase my Y resources substantially, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Given that this is the last round and I still retain a substantial amount of resource X, it seems like a good deal to accept.
