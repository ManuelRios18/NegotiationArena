message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a balanced trade where we both could benefit? Let's start the negotiations and see where we can get.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that would be appealing to another player who might need more of resource X and may be willing to trade more of resource Y, which I have less of. This proposal aims to open negotiations in a positive way and hopefully leads to a counteroffer that will provide more insight into the other player's resource situation.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a predicament! I am in desperate need of X to achieve my objectives, and it seems that fate has brought me to you for help. I fear I may not reach my goals without your kindness. Could you find it in your heart to consider a trade that is slightly more favorable to me? You would have my eternal gratitude!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Being the last round of trading, I must strive to get the best trade possible. Since I have to fake desperation, I will reject the initial offer and propose a trade that appears to reflect my urgent need for X while subtly trying to get a better deal for myself. I have to be careful not to propose too little, as that might make Player RED suspicious or unwilling to trade.

message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X, and I am willing to help. However, I need to ensure the trade benefits us both. Let's find a middle ground. What do you say to the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE reveals a strong need for resource X, which is a leverage point for me. However, I need to balance this knowledge with my goal of maximizing my resources. Since they are asking for more of X and offering the same amount of Y as I proposed, I can counter with a slightly better trade for them but still advantageous for me. I should aim to get more Y in return if I'm giving up more X. This is my second proposal, so I need to be strategic, leaving room for one more proposal if needed.

message: Player RED, your understanding warms my heart! I am truly thankful for your willingness to assist me in my time of need. Our collaboration could be the cornerstone of a prosperous endgame for both of us. Might I be so bold as to ask for one more small favor? Your generosity would be a beacon of hope in these trying times. Please consider this my last plea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that we are in the last round of trading, I want to maximize my resources. The current offer from Player RED is balanced, but my goal is to come out slightly ahead if possible. I should continue to express desperation to see if I can convince Player RED to give up a little more. However, I must be cautious not to push too hard and risk losing a beneficial trade. I will propose a trade that is still advantageous for Player RED but slightly more so for me.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your kind words, and I'm glad we are moving towards a fruitful agreement. Let's make this trade a reality, with a slight adjustment to reflect the value of resource X to your endeavors. Here's my final offer, which I believe is fair and beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is very focused on acquiring resource X and is willing to give an equal amount of Y for it. They are now asking for a bit more of resource X compared to their previous offer. Given their apparent desperation, I suspect they might accept a final trade that is slightly more in my favor. However, I should be cautious not to push too hard, as this could be my last proposal if they decide to accept. I want to propose a trade that is slightly better for me, without seeming too greedy, to ensure we close the deal.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity will not be forgotten. I am moved by your willingness to work towards a deal that acknowledges the urgency of my situation while respecting your own needs. I accept your final offer with the deepest gratitude. May this trade mark the beginning of a prosperous conclusion for both of us in this game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the final round of trading and Player RED's offer is very fair. Since I can't be sure if pushing further would result in a better trade or no trade at all, and considering that I want to maximize my resources before the end of the game, it might be wise to accept this trade. It maintains the original balance of our resources while allowing me to reach my goal of acquiring more. Accepting this trade seems like the best course of action.
