message: Hello, Player BLUE. As we're in our final round, let's make it count. I propose a trade that could benefit us both based on what we might need.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that is enticing to the other player while also maximizing my gains. Without knowing the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that offers more of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a similar distribution.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the trade, Player RED. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering 10 units of X for only 3 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade seems beneficial because I would be getting more than three times the amount of X for a relatively small amount of Y. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources and give me a more balanced amount of X and Y.
