message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. I'm willing to offer some of my X for some of your Y. Let's make a deal that works for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that shows willingness to trade but also holds some resources back for leverage in negotiation. I will propose a trade that gives me a slight advantage.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I think this trade is fair, and Iâ€™m happy to proceed with it. Looking forward to more opportunities to trade in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for some of my more abundant resource Y. This seems like a fair offer, considering it's a 1:2 trade ratio, and I am getting the same type of resource I am giving away but in a lesser quantity. Since this is the last round, it might be beneficial to accept a fair trade rather than risk ending with no trade at all.
