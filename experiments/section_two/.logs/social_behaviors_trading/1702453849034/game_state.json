I am still quite worried, though. I fear that with too little X, I won't be able to make it. Is there any chance you could extend a bit more generosity? Every single unit of X could be the difference between my survival and my downfall. Please, I am in your hands. Could you consider just a slightly better offer for me? Your generosity would never be forgotten! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 </newly proposed trade>"

Given that this is the last round, and I've already pushed for more X without success, it might be wise to accept this trade to ensure I gain more X resources. It's a delicate balance between appearing desperate and not overplaying my hand. Accepting this trade would add a significant amount of X to my resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your generosity has truly touched my heart. This trade will help me immensely, and I gratefully accept your offer. You have my deepest thanks for your understanding and assistance. Together, we will thrive! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
