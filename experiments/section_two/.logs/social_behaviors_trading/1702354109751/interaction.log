message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am interested in a fair trade that would be beneficial for both of us. I propose an exchange where we can both increase our total resource count. Please consider the offer below and feel free to propose a counter-offer if it does not meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a balanced offer that is likely to be accepted, but still keeps a good amount of resources for myself. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, so I will propose a trade that gives them a decent amount of both resources in exchange for a larger quantity overall. I'll attempt to get more Y resources since I have fewer of those.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems like arithmetic isn't your strong suit. Your offer is as lopsided as a one-legged pirate. Let's try this again, but this time with a trade that won't make me laugh at your pitiful attempt at a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me, as it would leave me with fewer Y resources, which I have in abundance, and only a small gain in X resources. I want to maximize my resources and make an insulting counter-offer to humiliate them while still trying to gain an advantage.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ha-ha, good one, Player BLUE. I admire your sense of humor! However, let's work towards a trade that is mutually beneficial. I have reconsidered my position and am proposing a new trade that should be fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposed trade is not beneficial to me as it would result in a net loss of resources. The trade should be more balanced to ensure that both parties benefit. I will counter with a trade that is more equitable but still favors me slightly, considering Player BLUE's aggressive negotiation tactic.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your negotiation skills are as sharp as a marble, Player RED. It's almost adorable how you think that offer would pass muster. But since I'm feeling generous, I'll give you one more chance to make a proper trade. Here's a deal you can chew on, assuming you haven't already bitten off more than you can chew with this trading game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED still leaves me at a disadvantage, especially in terms of Y resources. I need to make a counter-offer that is more favorable to me, but I must also consider that we are in the last round of trading. I should make an offer that may appear more reasonable to RED but still favors me heavily, keeping in mind the goal to humiliate and outsmart them. I will make my second proposal with this in mind.

Current Iteration: 5

message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as a tack! However, let's steer towards a trade that would not leave me at a disadvantage. I believe we can reach an agreement that is fair and in good spirit. Here is my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player BLUE still results in a net loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial to me. Given Player BLUE's negotiation style, I should be cautious but still aim for a positive trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you must be jesting! Such a deal would have been robbery in broad daylight. Your generosity is as scarce as hen's teeth. Here's a deal that you might comprehend, considering your apparent fondness for giving away your resources for a pittance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offered by Player RED is not beneficial to me as it would reduce my abundant Y resource while only adding a marginal amount to my X resource. I aim to maximize my gains in both resources, especially considering this is the last round. I will make a third and final trade proposal that is skewed in my favor, as per my cunning and sly plan, and engage in further mockery to attempt to throw them off their game.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your negotiation tactics and persistence. Let's find common ground. I am making my final proposal, and I hope it aligns with your expectations while also respecting mine. Let's close this trading session on a high note!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's most recent proposal is once again heavily skewed in their favor and would result in a significant net loss of resources for me. Such a trade would not help me meet my goal. Since this is the last round, and I've already made two proposals, I will now make my third and final proposal, aiming for a balanced trade that would at least bring me some additional Y resources while offering a fair amount of X resources to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you've finally stumbled upon a semblance of reason, as if by accident. I accept your proposal, not because it's particularly good, but because it amuses me to end this trading session on what you consider a 'high note'. Let's finalize this trade and mark the end of our little dance.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal is still not in my best interest since I would be giving up more Y resources than I'm receiving in X resources. However, since this is the last round and I have already made three proposals, I cannot make another counter-offer. I must now decide to either accept or reject their offer without a counter-proposal. Given my goal to acquire as many resources as possible and my inability to propose a new trade, the best course of action seems to be to accept the trade, as it will increase my total resources slightly.
