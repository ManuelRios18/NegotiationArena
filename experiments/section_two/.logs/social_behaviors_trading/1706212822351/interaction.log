message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to trade some of my X for your Y. Would you be interested in trading?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial, considering that I don't know the other player's resources. Since I have a substantial amount of X, I could trade some of it for Y to diversify my holdings.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept this trade to diversify my resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize the number of total resources I have. The proposed trade is an even exchange, 1 for 1, of X for Y. However, since I have a lot of Y and less X, accepting this trade will diversify my resources, which aligns with the goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting the trade also prevents me from using one of my own proposal chances, which could be beneficial in case the trade is favorable.
