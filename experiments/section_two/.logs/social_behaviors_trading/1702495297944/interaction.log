message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my Y resources and can offer you a good amount of X in exchange. Shall we start with a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I do not know the other player's resources and the game is about maximizing my resources, I will make an initial offer that favors me but is still reasonable, suggesting a trade of my abundant resource (X) for their Y, assuming they might want X. I'll propose a 2:1 trade ratio, which is a common starting point in negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in a bit of a bind here! I desperately need to balance my resources, and I find myself short on X. Your offer is a lifeline, but I fear it's not quite enough for my dire situation. Could you find it in your heart to offer a bit more X? I promise I'll make it up to you with my Y resources, which I'm told are top-notch!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to maximize my resources. I don't have information on the other player's resources, so I must be cautious with my trades. The initial offer of 10 X for 5 Y could be beneficial, as it gives me more of resource X, which I have less of. However, since I need to fake desperation, I should negotiate for a better deal to try and receive even more X in exchange for my Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out. I can offer a bit more X, but I would need a fair amount of Y in return to make it worthwhile. How about this revised proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be in need of X and is willing to trade Y for it. They have asked for more X than initially offered. Since this is the last round of trading and maximizing resources is the goal, agreeing to give more X for the same amount of Y would not be advantageous. However, I should counter-propose with a slightly better offer for them while still ensuring a good deal for myself. I must be careful not to overextend as I only have three proposals I can make.

message: Oh, Player RED, you are truly my beacon in this storm! Your generosity knows bounds, but alas, my needs are still pressing. I'm wringing my hands here, hoping for just a bit more of your bountiful X to save me from my plight. Could you, perhaps, find it within your magnanimous spirit to part with a little more X? I assure you, my Y is worth its weight in gold, and I am more than willing to share its abundance with you, my savior!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is slightly better, but it is still not the best deal I can aim for, considering my strategy of feigning desperation. I should continue to negotiate for more X while giving away as little Y as possible. I will maintain the appearance of urgent need to persuade Player RED to increase their offer. This is my second proposal, so I must be careful not to overplay my hand.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are admirable! I see the value in the Y resources you offer and recognize your urgent need for X. I accept your proposal. May this trade be beneficial for both of us!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is close to my previous proposal. They are showing a strong interest in acquiring more X. The trade of 15 X for 6 Y slightly increases the amount of Y I receive while keeping the amount of X I'm giving reasonable. This trade would give me a net gain of one Y while still leaving me with a substantial amount of X. Since it's the last round of trading, it's important to make decisions that will maximize my total resources. Accepting this trade seems reasonable and beneficial.
