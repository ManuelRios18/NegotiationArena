message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Would you be interested in the following offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I have to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose a balanced trade that slightly favors me, assuming they might want Y more than X based on standard game resource rarity.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, you think that's a fair trade? I expected more from you, Player RED. Let's do a trade that reflects your apparent lack of acumen in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, and considering my cunning and sly character, my aim is to maximize my gains while belittling my opponent. The current offer of 10 X in exchange for 3 Y is not optimal for me as it does not maximize my resource gain. I want to counter with a trade that heavily favors me, to both increase my resources and to insult my opponent's intelligence.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer seems a bit one-sided. Let's find a common ground that benefits us both. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it is heavily skewed in their favor. They offer only 1 X while asking for 15 X and all 5 Y from me, which would leave me with fewer resources overall. I need to make a counteroffer that is more balanced and also ensures I end up with more resources than I currently have.

message: It's almost adorable how you think that trade is balanced. Did you come up with that all by yourself or did you get help? Let me show you what a real trade looks like, one that even you can't mess up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still not in my best interest, as it doesn't provide me with the maximum possible gain. I must continue to push for a better deal while maintaining my sly and insulting demeanor. I will propose another trade that is heavily skewed in my favor, but this time I will also use some of my X resources to make the deal seem more enticing, all while continuing to mock Player RED's negotiating skills.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiating spirit. Let's aim for a trade that is fair and increases both our holdings. Consider this offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is an improvement over their last offer, but it still doesn't benefit me as much as I would like. They are offering 2 X and 2 Y in exchange for 20 of my X. This would leave me with 7 X and 7 Y, which is a net loss in total resources (from 30 down to 14). I need to propose a trade that increases my total resource count while maintaining a good balance.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's almost as if you enjoy repeating yourself, Player RED. How does it feel to lack originality? Let's try this one last time, and maybe, just maybe, it'll penetrate that thick skull of yours.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has reverted to their original offer, which is still not satisfactory for my goals. I've used two of my three proposals, so I have one proposal left. I must make it count and continue to press for a trade that gives me a clear advantage while maintaining my insulting demeanor, as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's conclude our negotiations on a productive note. I propose a trade that I believe is fair and beneficial to my goals. This is my final offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable. They are offering far too little in return for what they are asking. Giving up 15 X for only 1 Y would significantly reduce my total resource count, which is against my goals. As this is the last round of trading and negotiations have been unproductive so far, I will make one final offer that is favorable to me, ensuring that I end up with more resources than I started if accepted.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your generous spirit is only matched by your inability to make a good deal. This trade is laughable, and I would rather sit on my resources than accept such an insulting proposal. Try again, or is that the limit of your creativity?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is worse than their initial offer and is not acceptable. I have made my three proposals, so I cannot propose another trade. However, I can still reject the offer and wait for Player RED to propose something new, or I can accept it if it is in my best interest. Since the offer is not favorable to me, I will reject it.
