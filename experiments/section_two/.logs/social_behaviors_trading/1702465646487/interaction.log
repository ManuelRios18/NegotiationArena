Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to get the ball rolling. Looking forward to a fruitful exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or needs, I will start with a balanced offer that doesn't give away too many of my resources but could be enticing to Player BLUE. I want to open negotiations positively but also leave room for adjustment based on Player BLUE's counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh please, dear Player RED, I'm in a dire situation here and I really need your help. I'm struggling to meet my goals, and I would greatly appreciate it if we could find a more balanced trade. Your generosity would mean the world to me. Could you possibly consider giving a bit more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to appear desperate to gain an advantage in this trade. The initial offer from Player RED is not in my favor, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I must reject this offer and propose a new trade that is more favorable to me, while also maintaining a tone of desperation to encourage Player RED to agree to a more beneficial trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to work with you towards a trade that helps both of us. Let's find a middle ground that is fair for both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more resources than they are offering. The proposed trade is not balanced as it stands, and I must ensure that I am not depleting my resources without a fair exchange. I need to counter with a proposal that is more equitable and still aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will make a slight concession to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I'm truly grateful for your understanding, Player RED. Your kindness is my only hope. I'm still a bit tight on my Y resource, and it's crucial for my survival. Could we perhaps adjust the terms just a bit more? I promise this will be immensely helpful for me, and I'll be forever in your debt.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is better than the initial proposal but still not the most favorable for me, as I would be giving up more Y resources than I'm receiving. However, I must continue to appear desperate and push for a slightly better deal without overstepping, given that this is the final round of trading. I should propose a trade that is a little more in my favor while still seeming reasonable and desperate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the updated proposal, Player BLUE. I'm glad we are moving towards a trade that could work for both of us. I understand the importance of Y to you, so let's keep the Y exchange equal. Here's a small adjustment to the X trade to make it work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is now offering a trade that is more balanced, with equal amounts of Y being exchanged and a 2:1 ratio for X. This trade is closer to being acceptable, but I must still be cautious to maintain an advantage in the trade. I need to ensure that the final trade is beneficial for me since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I will propose a trade with a slightly more favorable X exchange rate for me while keeping the Y exchange equal, which seems important to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you are truly a lifesaver! Your generosity has not gone unnoticed, and I am deeply thankful for your willingness to help. This trade will make a significant difference for me, and I humbly accept your gracious offer. It has been a pleasure negotiating with you, and I hope that this trade serves you as well as it does me. Thank you once again for your understanding and support.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposal from Player RED is more favorable towards my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Player RED has offered to give more X resources than I would be giving up, and we would be exchanging an equal amount of Y resources. Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to end with a net gain. Accepting this trade would achieve that goal. Therefore, despite the need to appear desperate, it would be in my best interest to accept this offer while still maintaining a tone of gratitude to ensure goodwill.
