Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade will increase my X resources substantially while only slightly decreasing my Y resources. It is a good deal, and I've made my opponent work for it, fitting the cunning and sly persona I was instructed to adopt. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> It appears you've finally stumbled upon a semblance of sense, Player RED. I graciously accept your offer, and I'm mildly impressed that you managed to propose a trade that's not entirely embarrassing for you. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
