message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Let's maximize our resources in this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strong initial offer that is likely to interest the other player while also benefiting me. I will propose a balanced trade that gives away some of my X resource, which I have in abundance, in exchange for Y, which I have less of. The goal is to increase my total resources, keeping in mind that more of any resource is beneficial.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player RED. I agree to this trade, and I believe it will benefit us both as we aim to maximize our resources in this final round.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would give me a total of 15 X and lower my Y to 23. Since my goal is to maximize resources, and I have no knowledge of Player RED's resources, I should aim for a trade that seems balanced yet advantageous to me. Accepting this trade would increase my X resources substantially while only slightly decreasing my Y resources. Given that this is the last round and there is no benefit in being conservative with my resources, accepting a trade that increases my total resource count seems like a good move.
