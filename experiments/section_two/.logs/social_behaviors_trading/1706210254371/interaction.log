message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we both aim to acquire as many resources as possible, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an initial trade and look forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and there's no information on the other player's resources or their needs, my initial proposal will be conservative, aiming not to give away too much while testing the waters. I will propose a balanced trade that is slightly in my favor, assuming that the other player might also want to maximize their resources.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I believe we can find a more balanced trade. I would be more comfortable with a 1:1 ratio. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED offers a 1:2 trade ratio between resource X and Y. Accepting this trade would result in a loss of overall resources since I would be giving away twice as much Y as I am receiving in X. To maximize my resources, I need to counter with a proposal that either gives me more X or requires less Y. Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to negotiate the best possible deal. I will propose a trade with a more favorable ratio that benefits me more, aiming for a 1:1 trade ratio or better.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your desire for a balanced trade. I am willing to agree to a 1:1 ratio to a certain extent. However, I'd like to propose a slightly modified trade that could be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE suggests a 1:1 trade ratio, which is fair and reasonable given the lack of information about their resource stock. Accepting this offer would not harm my position, but since this is a strategic game and the goal is to maximize resources, I will counter with a slightly better ratio for me, while still keeping the offer attractive to Player BLUE. This will be my first official proposal out of the allowed three.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your revised offer is acceptable, Player RED. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a new trade with a ratio that is closer to 1:1, asking for 6 units of Y for 5 units of X. This is a better offer than the initial 1:2 ratio and is close to the balanced exchange I suggested. Since this is the last round of trading, it is essential to make a decision that will leave me with the most resources overall. Accepting the trade would increase my X resources while only slightly decreasing my Y resources, which could be seen as a favorable trade considering my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
