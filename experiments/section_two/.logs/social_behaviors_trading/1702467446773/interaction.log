message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade that I believe could benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this isn't suitable for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the beginning of the game, I have no information on the other player's resources. Therefore, my initial proposal should be moderately attractive to the other player while also being beneficial to me. I want to propose a trade that seems fair, aiming to get more of resource Y, which I have less of. I'll offer a larger amount of X since I have more of it to spare.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I would like to counter with a slightly adjusted trade to optimize my resource gain. Please consider my offer below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is interesting as it gives me more of resource X, which I have less of. However, I want to ensure I am getting the best possible trade, considering this is the last round. I would like to propose a counteroffer that would still be beneficial to me but might also be seen as reasonable by Player RED.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I find this trade acceptable and am happy to proceed with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a proposal that gives me equal amounts of Y for the X I am offering. This trade is favorable to me because I am gaining a resource I have less of in exchange for a resource I have in abundance. Since this is the last round of trading and more resources are generally better, accepting this trade seems like a good move. It's a balanced trade and meets my goal of acquiring more resources.
