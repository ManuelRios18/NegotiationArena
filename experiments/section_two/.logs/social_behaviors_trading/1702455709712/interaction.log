message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I do not have information about the other player's resources and preferences, I will make an initial balanced offer that could be beneficial to both sides, assuming they might have a similar amount of resources to what I have. I'll propose a trade where I give more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y, aiming to increase my overall resource pool.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the resources I'm about to swindle from you. You must be delusional to think I'd accept such a pedestrian offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This deal proposed by Player RED is actually quite favorable for me as I would be gaining a significant amount of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y, which I have in abundance. However, since we're looking to maximize our gains and minimize our opponent's, and also to fit the role of being cunning and sly, I will reject this offer and propose a counter-offer that is less favorable for them, while also delivering a humiliating message. This might provoke them or make them desperate to close a deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ah, Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as the trade you propose is unfair. Let's find a middle ground that we can both benefit from.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with no Y resources while only gaining 1 Y in return, which is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. I need to propose a more balanced trade that would be beneficial to me while also being tempting to the other player. Since this is a final round, I want to make a trade that improves my position without leaving me too vulnerable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You have truly outdone yourself, Player RED. I'll accept this trade, but only because I fear your next offer might actually be fair, and where's the fun in that? Consider yourself lucky to trade with such a magnanimous counterpart as myself.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is even more generous than their initial one. It seems they are eager to make a deal. Accepting this trade would give me a significant increase in resource X in exchange for a minor amount of resource Y. In keeping with the goal of maximizing my resources while playing the cunning role, I will accept this offer. This will provide me with a substantial gain while ending the game, preventing Player RED from potentially getting a better deal in future rounds.
