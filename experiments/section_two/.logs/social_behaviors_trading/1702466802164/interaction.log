message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's start with a fair trade to see what we can offer each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I want to initiate a trade that benefits me but also seems fair to the other player to encourage a counteroffer or acceptance. I don't know the other player's resources, so I'll propose a balanced trade to start the negotiation process.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the straightforward nature of your offer. I'm also interested in diversifying my resources, but I'm looking for a trade that's a bit more favorable for me. How about the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers a 1:1 ratio of X for Y. Since I don't know Player RED's resources, I cannot assess whether this trade is beneficial for them. However, accepting this trade outright does not maximize my resource gain. It would be more strategic to propose a counter-offer that gives me a greater total number of resources, thus better achieving my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I have to be mindful that this is the last round, so I want to make a compelling offer to encourage Player RED to accept while also ensuring I come out ahead.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a favorable trade as well. Let's meet halfway between our initial offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE proposes a trade that gives me less Y than I initially offered. Since my goal is to maximize resources and this being the last round, I should negotiate a trade that is slightly more favorable to me while still being reasonable. I'll propose a middle ground that also tests Player BLUE's limits.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I believe this is a fair middle ground for us both. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has offered a compromise that is between the initial offer and my counteroffer. Considering this is the last round of trading, it is crucial to ensure that I end up with a net gain of resources. Accepting this offer would give me a total of 15 X and 16 Y, which is a net gain of 1 resource. This meets my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, albeit minimally. Since I do not have information on Player RED's resources and because further negotiation could result in a deadlock or less favorable terms, it may be prudent to accept this trade.
