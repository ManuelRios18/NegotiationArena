message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to optimize our resources before the end of the game. Let's work together to increase our holdings.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations, aiming to increase my overall resources. Keeping in mind that I can't be too aggressive as it might lead to an immediate rejection and no trade at all. I'll propose a trade that offers more of my abundant resource (X) for less of my scarce resource (Y), hoping the other player values Y less or has more of it.

message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED. I believe this trade benefits us both and I am happy to accept it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers 10 of X for only 3 of Y. This seems to be a favorable trade for me because it gives me a significant amount of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y. I should accept this trade since it increases my total resource count and it's the last round of the game, so there is no advantage in holding out for a better trade.
