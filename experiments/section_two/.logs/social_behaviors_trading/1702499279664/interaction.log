message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where we both can increase our holdings. How about I give you some of my X in exchange for some of your Y? Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I should make a proposal that is fair but slightly in my favor to start negotiations. The other player might counter with a more balanced offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I'm interested in your X resources, but I propose a slightly different exchange to ensure a fair trade for both of us. How about this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for resource Y, of which I have a surplus. However, without knowing Player RED's resources, it's difficult to determine if the trade is balanced. Since it's the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my total resources, keeping in mind that I don't want to give away too much of my Y resource without a fair exchange. I'm inclined to counter-propose a trade that would allow me to gain more X without losing too much Y.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate the 1:1 trade idea. How about we meet halfway between our offers? I'm willing to give a bit more X if you can offer a bit more Y in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is a 1:1 trade, which is fair, but I should attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal since this is the last round of trading and I have two more proposals I can make. I should propose a trade that's slightly better for me but still reasonable enough that Player BLUE might accept it.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer. This trade seems fair and will benefit us both. Looking forward to the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new trade proposal by Player RED is closer to what I am looking for. It's better than the initial offer, as I would be giving away less of my Y resources. Since it's the last round, I need to ensure that I am maximizing my overall resources. Receiving 10 units of X for 12 units of Y seems like a more balanced trade, and I would still have a good amount of Y left. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal.
