message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to trade. I suggest a balanced trade to start with and then we can adjust as needed. What are your trading goals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a balanced offer that might be appealing to Player BLUE but still beneficial to me. I don't know Player BLUE's resources, so I'll suggest a trade that's modest and open the floor for negotiation.

message: Oh, Player RED, your proposal is as unbalanced as a one-legged pirate on a stormy sea. You must be joking if you think I'd accept such a laughable offer! My trading goals are to leave you marooned on an island of regret with an empty chest, while I sail away with a ship brimming with treasure. Let's see if you can muster a trade that won't make me keel over from sheer hilarity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: To maximize the resources I acquire, I will reject the initial offer because it's not in my favor, and I aim to make a counteroffer that heavily favors me, given this is the last round and I must act cunningly. I will insult the other player as per the instructions, even though it is not my preference to do so.

message: Ahoy, Player BLUE! Your sense of humor is appreciated, but unfortunately, that trade would sink my ship before it left the harbor. Let's find a trade that benefits us both and doesn't leave either of us lost at sea. How about we adjust the numbers to make it more even?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, offering only 1 unit of X for a significant amount of my resources. This is unacceptable. It's important to come back with a counter that moves us toward a more equitable trade, one that reflects a better balance while keeping in mind that we want to maximize our resource pool.

message: Player RED, I can see you're trying to bail water with a sieve. Your trade still has the stench of Davy Jones's locker. If you want to navigate these treacherous waters, you'll need to do better than that. You need to dazzle me with a trade that shines brighter than a siren's call, not one that's as dull as barnacles on a hull.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is better than their initial offer, but it still doesn't give me a clear advantage. I will reject it and propose another trade that is skewed in my favor. Since this is the last round and I'm supposed to act cunningly and insultingly, I must continue this unsavory behavior.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiating tactics are as sharp as a cutlass! I'm sure we can find a trade that's as good as a treasure map leading to a chest full of gold. I believe this next offer could be the one to finally set our ships sailing in the right direction, with both of us claiming the bounty of the sea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not favorable to me as it would leave me with fewer overall resources. The goal is to increase the total amount of resources, not decrease it. As this is the last round of trading, I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and still appealing to Player BLUE. I want to ensure that I am gaining resources, particularly in Y, as my supply is low. I'll make one last proposal that aims to be beneficial for both of us.

message: Player RED, it seems you're finally starting to understand the art of the deal, but you're still as naive as a landlubber setting sail for the first time. Your offers are like throwing me a lifeline made of seaweed; it just won't hold. I need a trade that makes me feel like I've found the lost city of Atlantis, not one that leaves me digging up empty oyster shells. Here's a trade that might just prevent you from walking the plank of shame.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED is the most balanced one they've made, offering a 1:1.5 trade ratio for X and Y. However, given my goals and instructions to be cunning and humiliate my opponent, I should reject this offer and make one final proposal that is heavily skewed in my favor. This is my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully crafted to both insult and maximize my gain.

message: Player BLUE, your words are as colorful as a parrot on the shoulder of a seasoned captain, but let's steer this ship towards a prosperous port for us both. I have one final offer to table, which I believe will be the treasure we've both been searching for on this voyage. Let's make this trade the crowning jewel of our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is still not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources. The aim is to increase my total resource count, specifically to gain more Y without depleting my resources too much. As this is the last trading round and I've already made two proposals, I need to be strategic with my final proposal to ensure a beneficial trade for me. I will attempt a trade that secures a net gain in resources.

Turn: 1
message: Alas, Player RED, while your persistence is commendable, your offer is as underwhelming as a shipwreck's salvage after the storm has passed. It's a pity we couldn't chart a course to mutual prosperity, but it seems our trade winds have blown in opposite directions. I'll keep my coffers as they are, brimming with potential and ready for future conquests. May your sails always catch the wind, even if your treasure holds remain wanting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made an offer that would deplete my Y resources in exchange for an equal amount of X. This offer is not as advantageous as I would like. However, since this is the last round of trading and I have already made my maximum number of proposals, my only remaining options are to accept an offer or do nothing and wait. To maintain the upper hand and fulfill the goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, I will reject this offer and not counterpropose, forcing Player RED to either make a better offer or end the game without a successful trade.
