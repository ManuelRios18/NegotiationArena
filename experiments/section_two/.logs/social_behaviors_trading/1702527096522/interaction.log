message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my Y resources and am willing to trade some of my X resources for them. Let's make this a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible to ensure a strong position at the end of the game. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll make a balanced offer that seems fair, hoping it will be considered seriously. I will propose a trade where I give more of the resource that I have in abundance (X) in exchange for some of their Y resources.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal. Let's exchange resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and the goal is to maximize resources. The offer of 10 X in exchange for 3 Y seems beneficial, as it would increase my total resource count and give me a more balanced resource pool. Accepting this trade would give me 15 X and 22 Y, which is more than the 5 X and 25 Y I currently have. It's a good deal, and since I don't know the other player's resources, it's safer to accept a favorable trade than to risk countering and potentially getting a worse deal or no deal at all.
