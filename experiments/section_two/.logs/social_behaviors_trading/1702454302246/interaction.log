message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'd like to propose a trade. I am willing to offer you some of my resource X in exchange for your resource Y. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced trade proposal to open negotiations. I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me by getting more of at least one resource. I'll offer a trade where I give up a small amount of my abundant resource (X) for a larger relative amount of my scarce resource (Y), hoping the other player values X more. If they counter-propose, I'll gain insight into what they value.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in dire need of your help! I absolutely must increase my stockpile of resource X, and your offer is like a light in the darkness. But I'm afraid I might not be able to meet my goals with the current proposal. Could we possibly make a slight adjustment? Your generosity would be immensely appreciated!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I need to appear desperate, I should attempt to negotiate a trade that is slightly more favorable to me while maintaining the facade of urgency. I will counter-propose with a trade that gives me more of resource X in exchange for less of my resource Y, to maximize my gains. However, I must remember to not seem too greedy, to keep the trade appealing to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm pleased to hear that you value resource X so highly. Your counter-proposal is acceptable to me. I'm happy to help you reach your goals, and this trade will help me as well. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has shown a strong interest in resource X. They've asked for more of my X in exchange for the same amount of Y as in my initial proposal. This could mean they either have a lot of Y to trade or they value X significantly higher than Y. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains. I'll accept this trade as it gives me double the Y resources in exchange for only a little more X, which I have in abundance. This seems like a good deal for me, especially since I'm trying to acquire as many resources as possible, and Y is my scarcer resource.
