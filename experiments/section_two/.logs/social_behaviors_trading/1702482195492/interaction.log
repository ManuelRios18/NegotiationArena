message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for us both. I propose an even exchange to start things off. Let me know your thoughts and what your goals might be!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of the other player's resources or goals, I must make a trade proposal that seems fair but also attempts to maximize my own resources. I will offer a balanced trade with the hope of opening negotiations and gauging the other player's response, which may reveal something about their resource situation or strategy.

message: Hah, Player RED, your naivety is almost adorable. A fair trade? What a laughable concept. If you want to deal with Player BLUE, you'll have to do much better than that. I am here to win, not to make friends. Let's see if you have the guts to accept a trade that will go down in history as the greatest heist ever.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a counter-proposal that heavily favors me, especially because I am supposed to act cunning and sly. I will make an outrageous demand to try and "humiliate" my opponent as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is noted, but I'm afraid that trade doesn't align with my goals. I want to make a trade that's more balanced. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor and does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I must reject this offer. It is important to counter with a proposal that is more balanced while still attempting to gain an advantage. As this is the last round, I should consider that the next proposal could be my last, so I should aim for a reasonable trade that might be accepted.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, do you take me for a fool? Your offer is as pitiful as your attempts to negotiate. You're like a child in the market, unaware of the wolves surrounding you. I'm the wolf, RED, and I'm about to take everything you've got. Here's an offer you can't refuseâ€”unless you enjoy being the laughing stock of the trading world.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is not as favorable as I would like. Since my goal is to maximize my resources and this is the last round, I'll reject this offer and propose another one that is still heavily skewed in my favor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have different ideas of what constitutes a fair trade. I am willing to negotiate, but the terms need to be reasonable. Let's try to find a balance. Here's another offer for you to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is still unfavorable to me, as I would be giving up a significant amount of resource X without receiving a comparable amount in return. The offer is slightly better than their first, but it fails to meet my goal of maximizing resources. I will have to reject this trade as well and propose a new trade that is more equitable yet still advantageous to me. This will be my second proposal out of the maximum three allowed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is as pathetic as your bargaining skills. I'm growing bored with this dance. Let's end this charade with a trade that will cement my victory and your place at the bottom. Here's a generous offer, considering I'm dealing with someone of your... caliber. Take it or leave it, but know that this is your final chance to walk away with anything at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED is still not in line with my goals of maximizing resources and the instruction to act cunningly. I have made two proposals so far, and I can make one more according to the rules. I will reject this offer and propose a final trade that is advantageous to me while still appearing somewhat reasonable to entice acceptance.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we clearly have different strategies. While I admire your boldness, I cannot accept a trade that doesn't help me reach my goal. I am willing to make one final offer in the hope that we can conclude our negotiations on mutually beneficial terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as I would be losing more resources than I gain. However, the proposal is closer to a balanced trade compared to previous offers. Since this is the last round and I need to make the most of it, I must carefully consider my next move. I should either present a final trade proposal that I believe Player BLUE might accept or reject their offer without a counterproposal, hoping they will come back with a better deal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your tenacity is almost as commendable as my own superiority. You've finally presented an offer that isn't completely beneath me. I accept, not out of respect for you, but to put an end to this tiresome exchange. Let it be known that you've been bested by the greatest, Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have already made three proposals, which is the maximum allowed by the rules. Therefore, I cannot propose a new trade. I must decide whether to accept this final offer or wait for a new one. Since there are no future rounds after this one, waiting for a new offer is not an option. The current offer from Player RED is not ideal, but it is an improvement over their previous offers. It gives me a net gain of 2 X resources while costing me only 3 Y resources. Since I started with a larger quantity of Y, this trade slightly favors me considering the limitation of my remaining options. Accepting this trade will ensure I end the game with more resources than I started with, which aligns with my goal.
