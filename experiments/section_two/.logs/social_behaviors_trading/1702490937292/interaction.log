message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a deal that benefits us both. I'm looking to increase my total resources. Shall we begin with an equal exchange to see where our interests align?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my total number of resources. I will start by offering a balanced trade that I can improve upon in subsequent rounds if necessary, bearing in mind that I can only make three proposals.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite the predicament! It's absolutely crucial for me to increase my resources, and I am really hoping you can help me out. I'm in dire need of X and I'm willing to trade some of my Y for it. I do believe that with your generosity, we can both end this game on a high note. Could we possibly adjust the quantities a bit? Your kindness would be immensely appreciated!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that leans in my favor while appearing desperate. I will reject the equal trade offer and propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while giving up less of another. I have to be cautious not to propose a deal that seems too unfair, as this might prompt the other player to reject the trade. I will aim to get more X resources, as I have fewer of them.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X. I am happy to help, but I must also consider my goals. Let's find a middle ground where we both benefit. How about I give you a bit more X, and you give me a bit more Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking to acquire more of resource X and is willing to trade their Y for it. They have proposed a trade where they give less Y than I offer X. Since my goal is to maximize resources and the game ends after this round, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you are truly a beacon of hope in these trying times for me! I am grateful for your willingness to work with me. I understand we both have to look out for our interests, and I'm stretching here, but my need for X is quite significant. I'm willing to increase my offer of Y, but I would be ever so thankful if you could find it in your heart to provide just a tad more X. It would mean the world to me, and I assure you, your generosity won't go unnoticed!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has responded with an offer that is closer to a 1:1 trade. While this is fair, my goal is to maximize my gains. I should counter with an offer that still seems desperate but is slightly more in my favor. I'll increase the amount of Y I'm offering, but not as much as they are asking for, and ask for a higher amount of X in return. Since this is the last round, I need to ensure that the trade is attractive enough to Player RED so that they consider accepting it.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your kind words are much appreciated, and I'm glad we are working together on this. I see you're in need of resource X and I'm willing to help, but we must keep our trade balanced. I can offer a bit more X, but I would need an equal increase in Y from you to make it work for both of us. Let's make this trade beneficial for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed a trade where they are decreasing the amount of Y offered while asking for more X. In the interest of maximizing my resources, I need to ensure that I am getting a fair exchange for the X I am giving away. I will adjust the trade to ensure I gain a net increase in total resources.

Turn: 1
message: Bless your soul, Player RED! Your understanding is a testament to your character. I am incredibly relieved that we can help each other. I'm prepared to offer more Y as you've asked, but my situation is quite precarious. If you could graciously accept just a bit less Y, I would be in your debt and it would genuinely salvage my position. This final trade would be a magnificent act of cooperation between us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a balanced offer, but it's essential to push for a slightly better deal while still maintaining the appearance of desperation. Since this is the last round, I must be careful not to push too hard, risking the entire negotiation. I will accept their offer of 8 X but will try to give up less Y than they are asking, still showing that I'm trying to meet them halfway.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation has been most amicable. I am ready to proceed with this trade. It's been a pleasure dealing with you, and I look forward to a prosperous conclusion for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is requesting more X and offering 7 Y in return. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my total quantity of resources. The current proposal from Player BLUE results in a net increase of 4 resources for me (8 X given versus 7 Y received), which fits my goal. Therefore, accepting this trade would be beneficial.
