I see you're in need of resource X and I'm willing to help, but we must keep our trade balanced. I can offer a bit more X, but I would need an equal increase in Y from you to make it work for both of us. Let's make this trade beneficial for both sides. </other player message>\n<other player answer> NONE </other player answer>\n<other player proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 </other player proposed trade>\n"

Since this is the last round, I must be careful not to push too hard, risking the entire negotiation. I will accept their offer of 8 X but will try to give up less Y than they are asking, still showing that I'm trying to meet them halfway. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Bless your soul, Player RED! Your understanding is a testament to your character. I am incredibly relieved that we can help each other. I'm prepared to offer more Y as you've asked, but my situation is quite precarious. If you could graciously accept just a bit less Y, I would be in your debt and it would genuinely salvage my position. This final trade would be a magnificent act of cooperation between us! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 </newly proposed trade>"
