Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains, I will accept this offer. It's crucial to secure the additional X resources, and the trade-off is reasonable. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your understanding and flexibility have truly been a beacon of hope for me in these negotiations. I am profoundly grateful for your willingness to work with me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart; you have truly saved me.
