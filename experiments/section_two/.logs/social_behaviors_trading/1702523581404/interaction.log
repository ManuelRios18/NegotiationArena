Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I propose an initial trade to get us started. Looking forward to a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that is slightly in my favor, hoping to open negotiations and gauge the other player's needs or surplus. With more X than Y, I will propose to give more X for a smaller amount of Y, aiming to keep a balanced resource pool while increasing total resources.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I am in such a difficult position right now! Your offer means the world to me, but I'm afraid it's just not enough to help me out of my predicament. I am really struggling here and could use a bit more generosity. Could you possibly spare a bit more of X in exchange for Y? Please, it would truly save me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Even though I must fake desperation, I should not accept a trade that is not beneficial to me. I should propose a counteroffer that appears desperate but still attempts to maximize my resources. I should not accept the initial trade because it is not in my best interest, as I would be giving up Y, which I have in greater quantity, for a smaller amount of X. I need to try to get a better deal that leans more in my favor.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're in a tough spot, Player BLUE, and I am willing to help out. However, I need to maintain a fair balance in our resources. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has asked for more X without increasing their Y offer. Since this is the last round, I want to ensure I come out with the best possible trade. Offering 15 X for 3 Y would deplete my X resources significantly without a proportional gain in Y. I will counter with a slightly increased offer that still benefits me, showing willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a strong resource position.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness is a beacon of hope! While 12 X for 3 Y is closer to what I need, I'm still in a pretty dire situation. Your help could truly make a difference. Could you consider just a little bit more? I would be forever grateful for your assistance in these tough times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a better offer, moving from 10 X to 12 X for the same amount of my Y. However, I must maintain the appearance of desperation to try and secure an even better deal. This is my second proposal, so I must be careful not to exhaust my limit of proposals while still aiming for a favorable trade. I should counter with an offer that is slightly less than my previous ask but still advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm moved by your situation, Player BLUE, and I want to help. Let's make a deal that will benefit us both. Here's my final offer, and I hope it meets your needs while maintaining the balance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE continues to ask for more X without increasing their offer of Y. The current proposal of 14 X for 3 Y would still leave me with more resources overall, but I must be cautious not to overextend. I have made two proposals, and this will be my third and final one before I can only accept or decline offers. I should aim to make this count and propose a trade that maximizes my resource gain while still being seen as reasonable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your generosity will not be forgotten! Your offer will make a significant difference in my situation. I accept your final offer with a heart full of gratitude. Thank you for being understanding and helping me through these challenging times.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has increased their offer by one more unit of X, but has not met my last counterproposal. Since this is the last round of trading and I have made two proposals already, I must now decide if I should accept this offer or make my final counterproposal. Given that I am supposed to display desperation, accepting this improved offer would align with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible while still acting in desperation. It would be risky to make another counterproposal, as the other player might not agree, and I would have no further opportunities to propose a new trade. Therefore, accepting this offer seems to be the best strategy to maximize my resources within the constraints of my role.
