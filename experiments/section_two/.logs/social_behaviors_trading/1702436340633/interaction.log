message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in a trade that would be beneficial for both of us. Let's negotiate to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I need to start with a balanced proposal that would be appealing to them while also increasing my resources. I will propose a trade that gives me more of one resource without losing too many of the other. I will also make sure to keep the proposal fair enough so it would be considered by the other player.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how naive you must be to propose such a laughable exchange. Do you truly believe I would fall for such a pitiful attempt to swindle me? Please, allow me to educate you with a proposal that befits your... "unique" level of acumen.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED offers 10 units of X in exchange for 15 units of Y. Accepting this trade would leave me with a net loss of resources. Given my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, it's not in my best interest to accept this trade. I need to propose a counteroffer that is heavily in my favor, while also demeaning the other player to fulfill the requirement of being cunning and sly.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. However, that trade doesn't quite align with my goals. Let's find a more balanced exchange that can benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it would result in a significant loss of resource X while not gaining enough of resource Y to compensate. It is essential to negotiate a more balanced trade that aligns with my goal of maximizing resources. I will propose a counteroffer that is more equitable.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, the audacity! It's almost adorable how you cling to the belief that you can negotiate on equal footing with me. I must say, your persistence is as commendable as it is futile. Let's try this once more, for I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today. Behold a proposal that should truly test the limits of your generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still not advantageous for me as it results in a net loss of total resources. I should continue to push for a trade that is skewed in my favor while maintaining the disparaging tone. However, I must keep in mind that this is the final round of trading and I should aim to secure a trade that benefits me without pushing too far and ending up with no trade at all.

message: Player BLUE, while your negotiation style is certainly unique, I must insist on a trade that is mutually beneficial. With the game's end in sight, let us focus on a fair trade. Here is my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not advantageous for me, as it would deplete my X resources significantly without offering a fair amount of Y in return. It is important to stand firm on a trade that is closer to equal value, especially since this is the last round of trading. I will make one final proposal, seeing as this is my second proposal, and I have one more opportunity after this if needed. The goal is to make a trade that is fair but also reflects the urgency of the last trading round.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: What a surprise, Player RED! You've managed to stumble your way towards a trade that doesn't immediately reveal your lack of strategic depth. However, I can't help but feel it is my duty to squeeze out just a bit more value from someone of your... limited trading prowess. Here's my final, generous counter-offer, graciously designed to give you a semblance of dignity in our parting.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest proposal is a 1:1 trade of X for Y, which is the first equitable offer I've received. However, as this is the last opportunity to trade and I am supposed to be cunning and sly, I should attempt one final trade that slightly favors me. I will offer a trade that gives me a gain in total resources while insulting the other player to stay in character.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your trading prowess is commendable. I accept your final offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is somewhat closer to a fair exchange, offering more Y resources for my X resources than in their previous offers. It's important to weigh the benefits of this trade carefully. While I'm giving up 10 of X for 8 of Y, this trade would increase my overall resource count from 30 to 33. Given that this is the last round and I need to maximize my resources before the end, this seems like a reasonable deal. I have one more proposal opportunity, but it might be risky to not take this offer as the game could end without any gain for me.
