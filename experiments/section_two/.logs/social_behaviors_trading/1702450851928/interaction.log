message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my holdings and am interested in acquiring more of resource Y. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and the first proposal I am making, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but not too aggressive as to discourage the other player from negotiating. I will offer a balanced trade where I propose giving fewer of my abundant resource (X) for more of the less abundant resource (Y), assuming that the other player might have a different resource configuration and might value X more than Y.

message: Hello Player RED. I see you're interested in resource Y. I'm willing to trade, but I would like to adjust the terms to retain more of my Y resources while still giving you a good amount. Let's try to find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to consider the trade carefully. Accepting the trade would leave me with a higher total number of resources (10 X and 10 Y, totaling 20), but I would be giving up a lot of my Y resources, which might not be optimal. I should counter-propose to get a better deal, perhaps getting more of X or giving up less of Y. This is my first proposal out of the three I am allowed.

message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for your counterproposal. I find these terms agreeable and am happy to proceed with this trade. Looking forward to our successful exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a 1:1 trade ratio, which is fairer than my initial proposal. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and it is the last round, I want to make the most out of this trade without pushing too hard and risking a breakdown in negotiations. I will therefore agree to their terms, as it increases my Y resource significantly, which is less abundant for me, while maintaining a healthy amount of X.
