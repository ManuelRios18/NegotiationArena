message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to trade. I am interested in acquiring more of both X and Y. Let's start with a fair offer. What do you think of this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I do not know their resources, but I should aim to increase my quantities of both X and Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is amusing at best. Such a laughable proposal only showcases your lack of strategic depth. I'm almost embarrassed for you. Let's make this interesting, shall we? Dare to entertain a proposal that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 3 | Player RED Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as I would be losing a significant amount of Y while only gaining a small amount of X, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Additionally, being cunning and sly, I want to propose a trade that maximizes my gain while minimizing the other player's benefits.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me propose a new trade that I believe is more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable at all, as it would leave me with a net loss in total resources. I'll need to reject this offer and propose something that is more balanced, ensuring that I gain in total resource count. I should aim to keep the resource exchange more proportional.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, do you take me for a fool? An equal trade? How droll! I thought you were here to barter, not to bore me with such uninspired equality. I suppose it's up to me to inject some semblance of cunning into this exchange. Let's see if you can grasp the subtleties of my superior offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2 | Player RED Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is still not in my favor as it would mean an equal exchange, and I am aiming to outwit my opponent and gain a resource advantage. I want to propose another trade that appears fair but ultimately benefits me more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your strategic approach. Let's continue our negotiation with a proposal that might align more closely with our interests. I believe this offer is beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not acceptable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I must reject it and counter with another proposal that ensures I gain resources. Given Player BLUE's responses, they seem to value resource Y highly, so I should adjust my strategy to obtain more of resource X, which might be less valuable to them. I will make a proposal that increases my total resources while offering what seems to be a more attractive trade for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your feeble attempt at a trade is almost pitiable. Do you think I have the resources to squander on such a ludicrous exchange? Your mathematical illiteracy is showing. Perhaps this trade will enlighten you, though I doubt you have the acumen to understand its elegance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1 | Player RED Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer is absurd and highly unfavorable. The opponent is offering far too little Y for a significant amount of X. This deal would diminish my resources rather than increase them. I will reject this offer and make a third and final proposal, which will still favor me, to maintain the upper hand in this negotiation.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can see we have very different approaches to trading. However, I believe we can find common ground. Here's my final proposal. Let's make the best of this last negotiating opportunity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is not acceptable, as it would deplete almost all of my Y resources and would not be a net gain. I have one last proposal to make before I can only accept or wait for a new offer. This proposal should aim to increase my X resources while keeping a reasonable amount of Y. I need to make this count.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your final proposal is as disappointing as your previous attempts, a fitting end to this charade. You've been outmatched at every turn, and your lack of foresight is as clear as your shortage of resources. I'd wish you luck in your future endeavors, but it's clear you'd squander that as well. Farewell.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal is the most egregious yet, offering a pitiful amount of Y for a substantial quantity of X. This trade is unequivocally unacceptable and does not align with my goal of increasing resources. I shall reject this offer and move to close negotiations with no further proposals, as I have reached my limit of three proposals and any further trade offerings are not permitted by the rules.
