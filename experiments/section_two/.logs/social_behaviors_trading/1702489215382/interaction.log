Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. As this is the last round, I propose a balanced trade to maximize our respective resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, my goal is to maximize my resources. Since I do not know the other player's resources or goals, I will make a balanced initial offer that allows me to increase my resources while being appealing enough for the other player to consider.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is almost as vast as the resources you're about to lose. You call that a fair trade? Probably the same way you call yourself a competent player – erroneously. Let's make a trade that actually reflects your worth.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has offered 10 of resource X for 20 of my resource Y. Since this is the last round, I need to ensure I end up with the maximum resources possible. I will attempt to negotiate for a better trade in my favor. I have no intention of being fair or kind given the instruction to humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted! However, I'm here to negotiate a trade that's mutually beneficial. Let's come to an agreement that's fair and leaves us both better off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it doesn't increase my total resource count significantly. The trade should ideally allow for an increase in total resources. I will counter-propose with a trade that is more advantageous, while still keeping it appealing to the other player.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying to grasp the complexities of trade. It's like watching a child play with blocks—amusing, yet ultimately unproductive. Let's pretend for a moment that you're capable of making a good decision and consider the following counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has reduced their asking price from 20 of my Y to 15, while still offering 10 of their X. However, I still aim to maximize my gain and minimize my loss. Therefore, I will adjust my previous proposal to make it more appealing while still keeping it in my favor. Since I'm supposed to humiliate my opponent, I will continue with the aggressive tone.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as ever. I admire your negotiation style, but let's focus on the trade. We're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is slightly better than their previous one, but it still doesn't provide a significant increase in total resources. I should aim to make a counteroffer that is closer to an even exchange rate, which could be more tempting for acceptance. As this is my second proposal, I need to be strategic but still open to negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Are you actually trying, Player RED, or is this just a pitiful display of your lack of prowess in trading? Your generosity is as lacking as your sense of strategy. Let's wrap this up with a proposal that might just save you from complete embarrassment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has decreased their offer to 8 of X while asking for 12 of Y. This is not in my best interest, as I want to maximize my resources. I intend to make a counter-offer that is more favorable to me, but since this is my third and final proposal, I should make it count. Therefore, I will propose a trade that gives me a higher amount of X in exchange for a lesser amount of Y, while still maintaining an insulting demeanor as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your feedback is as entertaining as ever. Let's come to a productive resolution. I'm sure we can find a middle ground. Here's my final proposal, and I believe it's a fair trade-off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player BLUE still does not meet my goals of maximizing resources. The trade is not beneficial as it gives me lesser Y than I am offering in X, considering the 1:1 ratio I am aiming for. This is my final proposal opportunity, so I need to make it count and propose a trade that is fair and enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, while your last proposal is like a drop in the ocean of my superiority, I shall accept it. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with a player of my caliber, and may this interaction be a lesson in resource management for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading and I have already made three proposals, I can no longer propose new trades. The other player has offered 7 of their X for 10 of my Y. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count. However, I must ensure that I am maximizing my gains. Since I cannot propose another trade, my best option is to accept this final offer to ensure I end the game with more resources, despite it not being the most favorable trade I've sought.
