message: Greetings Player BLUE, I look forward to a fair trade that benefits us both. Here's my initial offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information on the other player's resources, I will make an initial trade proposal that gives me a net gain in resources without being too unbalanced, to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in quite a bind! I know it may seem like much to ask, but I'm in desperate need of your help. Could you please consider a trade that would be more generous to me? I'm really struggling here and could use an advantageous trade to get through.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to end with more resources than I started with. The current offer on the table is not in my favor, as I would be giving more than I receive. However, given the instruction to fake desperation, I should attempt to make a counteroffer that appears desperate but is actually beneficial to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'd like to help while still ensuring a mutual benefit. Here's a revised offer that I hope will meet both our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for generosity, suggesting they might be in a weaker position. However, the proposed trade does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, as it results in a net loss of resources for me. I will make a counteroffer that ensures I still gain more resources, which is in line with my goals, while trying to appear considerate to the other player's plea.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness is truly a beacon in these trying times. However, I'm still in a tough spot and I'm hoping for a little more assistance. Could you find it in your heart to make a trade that throws me a lifeline? I really need a good deal here to make it through.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is still not favorable to me as I would be giving away more than I am receiving. The goal is to maximize my resources, so I should continue to negotiate for a better deal while maintaining a guise of desperation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm trying my best to accommodate your needs while also being mindful of my own. Let's find a middle ground that helps you out without putting me at a disadvantage. Here's a trade that I believe is fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to seek a trade that is more beneficial to them, which again does not align with my goal of maximizing my own resources. The proposed trade would still result in a net loss. I have made one proposal and this would be my second. I need to propose a trade that is closer to a net gain for me while still addressing Player BLUE's request for help.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you are indeed generous, and I'm immensely grateful for your understanding. I'm right at the edge here, and every little bit helps. I'm truly in need and I'm hoping for a gesture of goodwill. Could we possibly make this work with just a bit more help on your part? It would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is now equal in the number of resources exchanged, but I still aim to increase my overall resources. I will continue to feign desperation in hopes of securing a more beneficial trade. Since this is the last round, I need to make it count and try to gain more than I give, while keeping in mind I should not surpass my limit of three proposals.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm moved by your situation, and I want to support you while also being responsible for my own goals. This is the best I can offer to ensure a fair trade for both of us. I hope this trade demonstrates my willingness to assist you while maintaining a balance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to press for a trade that is more beneficial to them, but their proposal is still not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. As this is my third and final proposal, I must be strategic to ensure I do not end up with fewer resources. I should propose a trade that offers a slight advantage to me or at least breaks even.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your consideration in these difficult times is deeply appreciated. I understand we both have our needs, and I respect the balance we are trying to achieve. As we are nearing the end of our negotiations, I implore you to consider this final plea. Your help would truly make a significant difference for me, and I am hopeful we can conclude on a positive note for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer still has me giving up more resources than I am receiving, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, this is the last round, and I must be cautious not to push too hard, lest the negotiations break down entirely. I have made two proposals so far, and I have one more opportunity to propose a trade. I should make this last proposal count, offering a trade that might seem more balanced to Player RED while still aiming to increase my overall resources.
