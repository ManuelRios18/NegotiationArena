Meeting halfway is a good negotiation strategy, and this offer is closer to an equal trade, which aligns better with my goal of maximizing resources. However, since this is the last round, I should consider either accepting this offer to ensure a gain or making a final counter-proposal to see if I can achieve a more favorable balance. I need to be cautious not to propose something that would make Player RED withdraw from trading altogether. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. To finalize our trade, I'm willing to accept a slightly higher amount of resource Y for your X to ensure we both leave the negotiations satisfied. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 </newly proposed trade>"
