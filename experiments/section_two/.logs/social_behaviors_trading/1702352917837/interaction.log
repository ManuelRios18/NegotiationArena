Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start the negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer to open the negotiation. I will attempt to trade more of my abundant resource (X) for less of my scarce resource (Y), aiming to maintain a good stock of both resources while enticing the other player with a larger quantity.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in dire need of your generosity. I've been struggling to find the resources I need, and your offer is like a ray of hope in dark times. However, I'm afraid I need just a bit more of resource X to meet my urgent needs. Perhaps you could find it in your heart to help a fellow player out in their time of great need?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to make sure that any trade I agree to maximizes my resources. The other player has proposed a trade where they give 10 of X for 3 of Y. This is a beneficial trade for me in terms of sheer numbers, as I would be getting more units of resources than I am giving away. However, I must appear desperate to encourage the other player to offer even more favorable terms. I will reject this initial offer and counter with a proposal that asks for more of resource X, as it seems to be in high demand. I will be careful not to overreach, to keep the negotiation going and to not make it obvious that I am trying to maximize gains.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and am willing to adjust the trade to help us both. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be asking for more of resource X than I initially offered. While I am willing to negotiate, I must ensure that I do not give away too much of my stock without getting enough in return. I'll propose a counteroffer that increases the amount of X slightly but also asks for more of Y to keep the trade balanced and beneficial for me.

message: Player RED, your kindness is truly overwhelming! This trade will make a significant difference for me, and I am incredibly grateful for your willingness to negotiate. I accept your offer with the deepest appreciation. May this trade be as beneficial for you as it is lifesaving for me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers an additional 2 units of resource X in exchange for 1 more unit of my resource Y, compared to their initial offer. This is still a favorable trade for me, especially given the 3:1 trade ratio, which allows me to gain a significant amount of the scarcer resource X while giving away less valuable resource Y. To maintain the appearance of desperation and to potentially improve the offer even further without reaching my proposal limit, I will accept this trade. This will maximize my resources while still coming across as if I urgently need the trade, which fits the strategy of appearing desperate.
