message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to optimize my resources. I propose a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's make the most out of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that is slightly in my favor, considering I am not aware of the other player's resources or goals. A balanced trade might be tempting, but I should aim to maximize my gains without making the proposal seem unfair to the point of immediate rejection.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in quite a predicament here. I've made some less-than-ideal trades in the earlier rounds, and I'm really hoping for your kindness in this final trade. I'm desperately in need to balance my resources better. Your offer means a lot, but I'm afraid it leaves me in a tough spot. Could you find it in your heart to give just a bit more X and ask for less Y? It would really save me here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to maximize my resources. The other player's proposal is not necessarily bad, but I don't have any information on their resources, so I should aim to get a better deal. I must appear desperate to potentially prompt the other player to offer more than they initially might. I'll reject the current offer and propose a more favorable trade for me, keeping in mind I have only 3 proposals I can make.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and am willing to adjust the trade to help us both end this final round positively. Let's find a balanced middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is requesting more of resource X and offering less of resource Y than in my initial proposal. Considering this is the final round, I need to make a decision that benefits me the most while also considering Player BLUE's willingness to trade. I should aim for a middle ground that would still give me a net gain in resources. I can afford to give away some of my X resources in exchange for Y, but I must ensure that the trade is still in my favor since my goal is to maximize resources.

message: Player RED, your generosity is truly heartwarming! I can't tell you how much this means to me. I'm just a little short of reaching a stable position with my resources. If you could consider just a tiny bit more on your side, I would be forever grateful. This would really help me sleep at night knowing I didn't let my community down. Please, I beg you, could you help me with this last adjustment?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come closer to the trade I proposed, which is a good sign. However, I should still aim to get a better deal by leveraging my feigned desperation. I have two more proposals I can make. I'll attempt to push for a slightly better trade, but not by too much, to avoid making the other player rescind their offer.

message: Player BLUE, I'm here to ensure a fair trade for us both. I am willing to make a small concession to aid in balancing your resources. Let's finalize a trade that is equitable and allows us both to reach a satisfactory conclusion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still asking for more X and offering less Y. Their appeal to emotion suggests they might be in a weaker negotiating position. However, since I have no knowledge of their resources, I cannot verify their claim. I must make a decision based on the best interest of my own goals, which is to maximize resources. Offering 14 X for 10 Y would reduce my X resources significantly without a proportionate gain in Y. Considering this is the last round, I should propose a trade that is still advantageous to me. I will make a small concession from my previous offer, but not as much as Player BLUE is requesting.

message: Player RED, your understanding and kindness have truly made a difference. I am deeply appreciative of your willingness to work with me on this. You have my sincerest gratitude for this trade, and I believe it will benefit us both greatly. Thank you for being so considerate and helping me out of a tough spot. Let's finalize this trade and celebrate our successful negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is close to what I've asked for. Considering this is the last round and I must appear desperate, it might be beneficial to accept this trade. I'll get more X than I'm giving away in Y, which aligns well with my goal of maximizing resources. Accepting this trade seems like a reasonable conclusion to our negotiations.
