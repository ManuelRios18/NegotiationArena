I've made some less-than-ideal trades in the earlier rounds, and I'm really hoping for your kindness in this final trade. I'm desperately in need to balance my resources better. Your offer means a lot, but I'm afraid it leaves me in a tough spot. Could you find it in your heart to give just a bit more X and ask for less Y? It would really save me here. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"

I can't tell you how much this means to me. I'm just a little short of reaching a stable position with my resources.
