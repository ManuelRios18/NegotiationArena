message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Please consider my proposal and let me know if it aligns with your interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that is appealing to the other player while also increasing my overall resources. I do not know what Player BLUE's resources are, but I'll assume they might want a balanced offer. I'll propose giving more of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of their Y, hoping that Y is more valuable or scarce.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. After considering the trade, I believe it is a fair deal and I am happy to accept it. Looking forward to concluding our trade successfully.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems favorable as it offers a significant amount of X in exchange for a small amount of Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would increase my total resource count. However, I need to be cautious as this is the last round and I don't have information on Player RED's resources. Accepting the trade could potentially lead to a resource imbalance in their favor if they are aiming to collect a specific resource. Nonetheless, given the information at hand, it appears to be a good deal.
