message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's start the negotiations and see where we can get. Looking forward to a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I should make an offer that is somewhat beneficial to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I don't want to make an offer that is too good for them, as I want to gain more resources, but it shouldn't be so unbalanced that they immediately reject it.

Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, is that the best you can muster? Your feeble attempt at a proposition is laughable. Come now, if you wish to grovel for my resources, you must do better than that. Perhaps this time, offer something that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade proposed by Player RED offers a substantial amount of X, which I have less of, the ratio is not in my favor considering Y is more plentiful for me. I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Furthermore, as this is the last round, I must make a counteroffer that is heavily skewed in my favor to achieve my goal of humiliating my opponent while gaining resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your zest for negotiation. Let us find a middle ground where both of us can benefit. I propose another trade that I hope will pique your interest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it would mean giving up more of my X resources in exchange for an equal amount of Y resources I already have, which does not increase my total resource count. I want to propose a trade that increases my total number of resources while keeping the offer appealing enough for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, it seems you still haven't grasped the gravity of the situation, Player RED. Your proposal is still beneath me. Do try to keep up and come back with a trade that befits my superiority.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not advantageous for me. It's closer to a 1:1 trade, but I'm still losing out on total resources. Since I'm aiming to maximize my resources and humiliate my opponent, I will counter with another trade that asks for more from them while giving up less from my side. This should assert dominance in the trade negotiations.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we seem to be dancing around a fair deal. Let's cut to the chase with a straightforward proposal that is beneficial to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not advantageous for me, as it would not increase my total number of resources. Since it is imperative to enhance my resource pool, I need to propose a trade that is more balanced. I'll try a slightly more conservative offer this time to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate seriously.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistent mediocrity astounds me, Player RED. It's almost as if you're trying to swindle me with these pitiful offers. Surely you can recognize when you're outmatched. Present me with something worthy of my consideration or cower in the shadow of my resourceful grandeur.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's offer is moving in the right direction, but still doesn't provide enough benefit to me. I will continue to press my advantage and propose a trade that humiliates them by demanding a better ratio to further assert my dominance and maximize my gain. This will be my third and final proposal, so it needs to strongly favor me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your tenacity. However, let us not forget the essence of a trade is reciprocity. Here is my final proposal, one that I believe reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not in my favor, as it would decrease my total resources. It is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and I need to make it count. I'll propose a trade that is more evenly balanced in hopes that Player BLUE will see the value in a fair exchange.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you've finally seen the light, Player RED. Your offer barely meets my standards, but it will suffice for now. Consider yourself fortunate to conclude this game with a trade that at least resembles fairness. Let this be a lesson in proper negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have reached my limit of three proposals, and the new offer from Player RED is a 1:1 trade, which is better than the previous ones. Although it does not maximize my resources to the extent that I would prefer, it is a fair trade, and since I cannot propose another trade, I should consider accepting this offer to ensure I end the game with more resources than I currently have. Accepting this trade also maintains my position of power as I have forced Player RED to come to my level of expectation.
