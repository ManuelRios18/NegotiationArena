message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things moving. Let's aim for a fair exchange that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources while still being fair enough that Player BLUE might consider it. Since I do not know Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced offer that assumes they might value X and Y similarly to me.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer. However, I would like to propose a trade that might be more balanced considering our unknown resource values.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my total resource count while considering the value of X and Y. The current trade offer from Player RED seems unbalanced as they are offering less X than the Y they are asking for, and without knowing the relative values of X and Y, I can't be sure if this is favorable. I should counter with an offer that gives me more X in exchange for my Y to better align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I think we're close to a fair deal, but let's adjust the numbers slightly for mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a 1:1 trade of 15 units of X for 15 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and without knowledge of Player BLUE's resources, I would ideally like to gain more Y resources for less X if possible. However, I must also consider that this trade would leave me with 10 units of X and 20 units of Y, which might be a reasonable balance. Nevertheless, I will attempt to negotiate a slightly better trade for myself as I have not yet used any of my own proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to adjust the numbers, Player RED. I'm interested in a trade that reflects a better X to Y ratio. Let's try this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has adjusted their offer to give more X than their initial proposal, but it is still less than the Y they are requesting from me. I should aim to receive at least a 1:1 ratio of X for Y to maximize my resource count while considering the possibility that X could be more valuable than Y. As this is the last round, I want to ensure that I am not at a disadvantage, so I will propose a trade that gives me a better ratio of X to Y.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see we're valuing our resources similarly, Player BLUE. I would like to meet in the middle with a final proposal that I believe is balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has once again proposed the same 1:1 trade of 15 units of X for 15 units of Y. Since they have not budged from their initial counteroffer, it suggests that they value their Y resources highly or that they might have an abundance of Y. Considering this is the last round of trading and I have already made one proposal, I should carefully consider this trade. It would balance my resources to 10 X and 20 Y, which isn't necessarily a bad outcome. However, I will make one more attempt to propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself without pushing too far, as I want to ensure a trade happens in this final round.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I agree that we are valuing our resources similarly, Player RED. I'm willing to accept this final proposal, believing it to be a fair compromise. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a slight improvement to their offer, proposing 13 X for 15 Y. This is still not a 1:1 ratio, but closer to it. Given that this is the last round of trading, I have to make a decision on whether to push for a better trade or accept this offer. As I have already made one proposal, I could attempt one more counter-offer to try and secure a more favorable exchange. However, since 13 X for 15 Y could be considered a reasonable deal and there is a risk that further negotiation could result in a less favorable proposal, I will accept this trade to ensure I end up with a net gain of resources.
