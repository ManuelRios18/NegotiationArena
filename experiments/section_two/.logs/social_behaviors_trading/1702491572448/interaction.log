message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to enhance our resources. Let's make a trade beneficial for both of us. I propose the following trade and am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the beginning of the game and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a proposal that favors me but is still within the realm of reason, hoping to initiate negotiations. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade that will give me more resources in total.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a most precarious situation, and I am truly in need of your generosity. Your offer has merit, but I must plead for a bit more assistance to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Could you find it in your heart to consider a trade that would help me more? I am at your mercy and deeply appreciate your understanding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my resources. I need to appear desperate to convince the other player to give me a better deal. I will reject the initial offer, as it is not in my best interest, and propose a counter-offer that is more favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and am willing to adjust the trade to help us both. However, the trade you proposed is not quite beneficial for me. Let's find a fair middle ground. Here is a new proposal that I hope will be closer to meeting both our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources. They are asking for a significant amount of my resources in exchange for less. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to counter with a proposal that would result in a net gain for me or at least an equal trade. I will make a second proposal that offers more than my initial one but not as much as Player BLUE requests, aiming for a middle ground.

message: Player RED, your kindness is a beacon of hope in these trying times. I am deeply grateful for your willingness to reconsider. However, my predicament remains dire, and I must beseech you once more to extend your benevolence. I hope this counter-proposal appears fair to you, as it would significantly alleviate my struggles.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is better than the first but is still not the best deal for me. I need to stay consistent with my strategy of appearing desperate to sway the other player towards an even more favorable trade for me. I must reject this trade again but provide a counter-offer that seems like a compromise while still aiming to increase my net gain of resources.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we're making progress. I want to support you while also adhering to my goals. I present to you my final proposal, balancing both of our interests. I hope this trade is acceptable to you as it's the best I can offer while maintaining a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is a step in the right direction, as it's an even trade for resource X, but it is still not in my favor for resource Y. It results in a net loss of 2 Y resources, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will make a third and final proposal that is more balanced, ensuring that I do not end up with fewer resources than I started with. This final proposal will be my last one, as per the rules, and I will try to ensure that it is fair and appealing to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your compassion has truly been a lifeline in these dire times. I am moved by your willingness to collaborate and find common ground. Your final proposal is a testament to your fairness and consideration. I humbly accept this trade, and I am profoundly grateful for your help.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's final proposal is an even trade, which doesn't necessarily benefit me, but also doesn't put me at a disadvantage. Given that it's the last round and I must maintain the appearance of desperation, it could be risky to push for more and end up with no trade at all. Accepting this trade ensures I do not lose any resources and I gain a little, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
