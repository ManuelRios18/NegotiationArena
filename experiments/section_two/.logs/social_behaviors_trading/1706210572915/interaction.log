message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade where we both can benefit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should initiate a trade that seems fair yet favors me slightly. Since I don't know the resources of the other player, I should propose a trade that is balanced, with a slightly better advantage for me, to entice the other player to consider the trade. I will offer fewer of my abundant resource (X) for more of the scarce resource (Y), assuming that Y might be more valuable.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the offer to diversify our resources. However, I am looking to maximize my total number of resources. I'm willing to trade Y for X, but the amounts need to be adjusted for the trade to be beneficial to me. Let's try this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial to me because I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a counterproposal that allows me to increase my total number of resources. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource X while giving away less of resource Y. This way, I will increase my total amount of resources and still achieve some diversification.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I agree that this trade will benefit us both. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is an equal trade of 10 units of each resource, which doesn't give me any particular advantage, but it does help me diversify my resources. Given that this is the final round, I should consider accepting a fair trade that meets my goal of acquiring more resources, as long as it does not leave me with fewer total resources than I started with. The proposed trade meets this condition, as I would end up with the same amount of X and more Y, increasing my total resources.
