message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a profitable trade for both of us. I propose the following trade and am open to counter-offers if this doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I do not have information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that might be appealing to the other player while still increasing my total resource count. I will propose a trade where I give away fewer resources than I am asking for, but keeping it reasonable so that the other player might consider accepting the proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your attempt at a trade is as pitiful as your grasp of strategy. I would laugh, but I wouldn't want to embarrass you any further. Let's do a real trade—one that befits my superior position and your obvious desperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would have me give away more resources than I receive, which is not in line with my goal. My strategy is to propose a counter-offer that maximizes my gain while minimizing what I give away. Given that this is the last round and that I want to humiliate my opponent, I will also make sure to include an insult in my message.

message: Player BLUE, your spirited words are noted. However, the trade must be mutually beneficial. Let's find middle ground. How about a revised proposal that reflects fairness and strategic partnership?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me at all; it's clear they are trying to take advantage of my resources without offering much in return. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will reject this offer and propose a more balanced trade that is closer to my original offer but with slight adjustments to make it more appealing to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Your notion of fairness is as lopsided as a one-legged pirate. I'm beginning to think that forming a strategic partnership with you would be akin to teaching a donkey to read – pointless and frustrating. But because I'm magnanimous, I'll give you another chance to bask in the glow of a superior trader's benevolence. Here's a trade you should be groveling to accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised proposal from Player RED still does not work in my favor as it requires me to give away more than I receive. My counter-proposal will be skewed in my favor, and I will continue with the demeaning tone as per the instructions. I have to ensure that I don't propose more than three times, so I will use my proposals wisely.

message: Player BLUE, your generosity is... unique, but let's keep our eyes on a fair exchange. Here's a proposal that should align with your esteemed trading acumen and ensure that both of us come out ahead. Shall we proceed with this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor. They are offering significantly less than what they are asking for in return. I need to propose a trade that is closer to a one-for-one exchange rate to maximize my resource gain. Since this is my second of three allowed proposals, I will attempt to make a trade that is more conservative yet still advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair exchange? It's clear that you wouldn't know a fair trade if it slapped you across the face with a wet fish. You're like a merchant who pays to take his own goods to market! It's time for you to sit down and pay attention to how a real trader operates. This is the deal you should be groveling to accept, assuming you have the wits to understand its brilliance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is an even exchange of X resources, but it would have me give away Y resources for nothing in return. This is not acceptable. I must propose a trade that is clearly advantageous for me while degrading Player RED. It is my second proposal, so I must be strategic and insulting.

message: Player BLUE, your trading style is certainly... assertive. Let us engage in a trade that reflects the wisdom of both our positions. Here is my final offer, one that I hope you'll find to be the epitome of shrewd trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not acceptable. They continue to ask for more than they are willing to give. As this is the last round of trading and my third proposal is my final opportunity to propose a trade, I will make an offer that is both fair and enticing. I will suggest a one-for-one exchange for X and a slight advantage for them in Y, aiming for a more balanced trade that might appeal to their sense of superiority.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Assertive? I prefer the term 'dominant.' Your 'final offer' is yet another display of ineptitude. It's like watching a child trying to use a slingshot and hitting themselves in the face every time. It's almost sad, really. Here's what a true final offer looks like, one that a trader of your... caliber might finally grasp as advantageous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is still not in my favor. I'm giving away more Y resources than I am receiving, and the exchange of X is even. I will counter with a trade that is beneficial for me and fits the goal of acquiring more resources. Since this is the last round, I need to make sure I come out on top, and I will also include an insult according to the instructions.
