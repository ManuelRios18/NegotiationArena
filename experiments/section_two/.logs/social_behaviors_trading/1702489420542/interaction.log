message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by giving me more resources. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, so I will make an initial balanced offer and adjust based on their response.

message: Oh, Player RED, is that a joke? Your offer is as lopsided as your strategy seems to be. Let's make a trade that actually shows you understand the art of the deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my gains. The current proposal from Player RED gives me fewer X resources and only a slight increase in Y. I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me more X resources, as I am starting with less of them, and also capitalizes on my abundance of Y. I will keep the trade within the bounds of rationality while still trying to tilt it in my favor as much as possible.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but let's find a more balanced trade. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me since it significantly reduces my X resources while offering a large amount of Y, which I have less of. However, the trade is not balanced in terms of overall resource gain. I need to counter with an offer that gives me a net gain in resources, keeping in mind that it's my first counterproposal out of a maximum of three.

message: Player RED, you must be delirious if you think I would accept such a pittance. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll offer something that won't make me laugh.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED is better than their initial offer, but I still believe I can push for a more advantageous trade. I'll aim to get a good amount of X resources while giving up fewer Y resources, which I have in abundance. I'll also add some light mockery to keep up with the sly and cunning persona.

message: Player BLUE, let's work towards a trade that is fair for both of us. Here's another attempt to balance our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal still does not provide me with an overall gain in resources. They are offering more Y resources for fewer X resources, but the trade is not equivalent in value. I need to make a second counterproposal that is more mutually beneficial while still aiming to increase my total resource count.

message: Finally, Player RED, you've managed to scrape together a trade that's worth my time, even though it seems you're giving away more than you can afford. It's a wonder you've made it this far in the game with such generosity.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal by Player RED is actually advantageous for meâ€”it gives me a net gain in total resources (5 X and only 8 Y lost). Considering my goal is to maximize resources and this is the last trading round, it would be beneficial to accept this trade. Additionally, since I've been instructed to humiliate the opponent, I'll do so in my message while accepting their offer.
