message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to get things started. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will aim to propose a trade that is favorable to me but also plausible for the other player to consider. I don't know what the other player has or needs, so I'll start with a balanced offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, thank you for the initial offer. I would like to counter with a proposal that might be more beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal from Player RED suggests an equal exchange of resources, 10 for 10. However, without knowing Player RED's resources, it's difficult to evaluate the fairness of the trade. The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. To achieve a more advantageous trade, I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more resources than I am offering. Since I have a surplus of Y, I can afford to give some of that up in exchange for more of X, which I have less of.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I find the current ratio a bit high. Would you consider a slightly adjusted trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it stands since the ratio of X to Y has increased unfavorably for me. However, I am willing to negotiate to find a middle ground. I want to make a counter-proposal that slightly increases the amount of Y I receive for the X I am giving up, as I have plenty of X to spare.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I accept this trade. Looking forward to more prosperous dealings in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still favorable as it allows me to acquire more of the resource X, which I have less of, while giving away only a slightly higher amount of resource Y, of which I have a surplus. This trade would still result in a net gain of resources, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would be beneficial, as it increases my total resource count and improves the balance between my X and Y resources.
