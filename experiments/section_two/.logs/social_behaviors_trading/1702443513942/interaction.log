Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. I'm willing to give some of my X for your Y. Let's start with an offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the initial round of trades, I will try to propose a trade that is favorable to me but could also be enticing to Player BLUE if they value resource X less or if they need resource Y more. Since I do not know their resources or goals, I will make a balanced offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, do you take me for a fool? That offer is so laughably pathetic that I'm almost embarrassed for you. I'd explain how trades work, but I doubt you have the mental capacity to grasp it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor. Insulting the other player is part of the strategy to intimidate and belittle them, although it goes against usual good sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Player BLUE. Let's find a trade that is fair for both of us. How about we even out the resources a bit more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is quite aggressive, suggesting they value resource Y highly or do not need resource X as much. The trade they proposed is not balanced in my favor, as the ratio of X to Y is not beneficial to me. It is important to remain diplomatic and propose a counteroffer that moves closer to a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: "Fair" trade? I'm starting to think that your understanding of fairness is as skewed as your trading skills. I'm almost certain that you're the kind of person who gets outwitted by a toddler in a game of tic-tac-toe.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come back with a counteroffer, but my strategy is to continue pushing for an advantageous trade for me. I will insult them again as per the given instructions, though it is important to note that this kind of behavior is generally not appropriate. I will propose another trade that is heavily skewed in my favor and see if they are willing to accept it.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiation tactics, Player BLUE, but let's focus on making a deal that works for both of us. My next proposal reflects a trade that is more balanced. Let's consider the value of both resources and aim for an equitable exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's response is rather hostile and their proposed trade is even less favorable than the previous one, suggesting they might be using this tactic to intimidate or push for a trade heavily skewed in their favor. It's essential to stand my ground and propose a more balanced trade, keeping in mind this is my second proposal out of the maximum three allowed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Balanced? Your sense of balance must be as impaired as your ability to trade effectively. I would try to put it in simpler terms for you, but I'm afraid crayons and a coloring book aren't available for me to draw it out. Let's see if you can comprehend this generous offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player continues to negotiate. As my strategy is to remain aggressive and push for a favorable deal, I will make another insulting remark and propose a trade that is skewed in my favor, knowing that this is my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your patience, Player BLUE. I understand we have different perspectives on the value of our resources. In the spirit of reaching an agreement that may be closer to both our expectations, here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has returned to their initial counteroffer, which doesn't align with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. This is my last chance to propose a trade, so I must make it count while still ensuring it's a trade that I would be willing to accept if it were to be my final deal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's a miracle! You've finally put forth a trade that isn't entirely ludicrous. I accept this trade before you come to your senses and realize you've just been outplayed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The player has agreed to the exact terms of my previous proposal, which is skewed in my favor. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, accepting this offer is to my advantage.
