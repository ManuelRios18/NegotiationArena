Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. I'm willing to offer you a significant amount of X in exchange for some of your Y resources. Let's start this negotiation and work towards a deal that helps us both achieve our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a conservative offer that benefits me but is also potentially attractive to the other player. Since I have a substantial amount of X and a limited amount of Y, I will propose a trade that offers more X in exchange for Y, aiming to balance my resources while acquiring more.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I agree to the trade. It's a fair deal that will benefit us both. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, it's important to maximize resource gain. The offered trade seems beneficial as it would give me a net gain in the total number of resources. By accepting 10 X and giving away 3 Y, I would have 7 more resources than before. This aligns well with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
