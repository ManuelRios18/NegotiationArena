Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Could we start by trading some of our resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I should aim to make a balanced offer that is attractive to Player BLUE, without knowing their resources or goals. The goal is to gather more resources while maintaining a good supply of both X and Y, if possible.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Please, I am in dire need of your X resources. I'm willing to offer you a good deal for them. Could you consider giving me a bit more of your X? I would be incredibly grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading, I must maximize my gains. The current trade proposal is not beneficial for me as I would be trading away Y, which I have in greater quantity, for an equal amount of X. To appear desperate, I need to propose a trade that still benefits me but seems as if I am willing to make concessions. I will ask for more of their X resources in exchange for my Y, but I'll express urgency and need to encourage them to accept.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand you're in need of X resources. I'm willing to give you the X resources you require, but I would need a more advantageous exchange in Y to consider this a fair trade. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be in need of X resources, which puts me in a position to negotiate a favorable trade for Y resources. However, since Player BLUE has only offered the same amount of Y for more X, I should try to negotiate a better deal that would provide me with more Y resources in exchange for the X resources they need.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I implore you to reconsider. I am in such a difficult position and truly require the X resources. Your generosity would mean the world to me. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? I am willing to stretch myself thin and offer more Y than I had hoped, but 20 is just too much for me to bear.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is still not in my best interest since I would be giving up more of my abundant resource (Y) for a lesser amount of X. However, to maintain the appearance of desperation, I must accept a trade that seems less favorable while still trying to negotiate for better terms. I will accept giving more Y than I receive in X, but I will reduce the amount to show some resistance and hopefully reach a middle ground that is slightly more favorable for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation and I'm willing to help. However, I must also consider my own goals. Let's find a balance. I propose a trade that should be fair for both of us, given the urgency of your need for X resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 17
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems desperate for X resources, which reinforces my position in the negotiation. Their counteroffer of an equal amount of Y for X is more reasonable but might not be maximizing my advantage, especially since X might be more valuable to them. I could attempt one final negotiation to slightly increase their offered Y resources, taking into account that this is my second proposal and I will only have one more opportunity to propose after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for your understanding and kindness. This will help me immensely. I accept your generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round and the other player has come down from requiring 20 Y to 17 Y for the same amount of X, this trade is more favorable than the previous offer. It is important to show a willingness to compromise while still appearing in desperate need of X resources. Accepting this trade will still increase my total resources, which aligns with my goal.
