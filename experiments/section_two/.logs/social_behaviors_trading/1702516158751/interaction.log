message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's make a trade that's beneficial for both of us. I propose the following exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll make a balanced offer that allows for a reasonable trade while keeping a good amount of my own resources. I will propose giving away less of the resource I have in abundance and ask for more of the one I have less of, aiming to balance my resources while increasing the total amount.

message: Ha! Your offer is almost as laughable as your strategy, Player RED. Do you take me for a fool? I would be embarrassed to even consider such a trade. Let's make a real deal, one that befits my superior intellect.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED involves me giving up an equal amount of resources (4X + 4Y) in exchange for more X but less Y. Given that I have a significant amount of Y, it might be beneficial to accept more X, but the offer seems balanced, not providing a clear advantage. To push my cunning and sly agenda, I should counter with a proposal that is heavily in my favor, while also belittling Player RED's offer as if it were an insult to my intelligence. This will be my first proposal out of the 3 I'm allowed, and I should aim to maximize my gain while being demeaning, as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking for a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's find some common ground. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a significant amount of both my resources while offering very little in return. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal that is more balanced and still aims to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost cute how you think you can negotiate on my level, Player RED. Your offer is a pitiful attempt to salvage some dignity. Here's a counteroffer that a player of your... caliber might understand. I'm being generous by even allowing you the honor of trading with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal by Player RED still doesn't provide me with a clear advantage. As per my cunning strategy, I should continue to belittle their offers while pushing for a trade that is significantly in my favor. This will be my second proposal. I'll slightly adjust my previous offer to make it seem like I'm moving towards a middle ground, while still ensuring that I come out on top.

Current Iteration: 5

message: Player BLUE, I must insist on a trade that is mutually beneficial. Let's aim for a balanced exchange that we can both be satisfied with. Consider this revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not in line with my goals. They are asking for a large portion of my resources in exchange for a minimal return. To move towards a more equitable trade, I will make a second counter-proposal that aims to increase my total number of resources while offering a fair exchange to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You must be delusional to think that such a pedestrian offer would be accepted by a player of my stature, Player RED. But I'll indulge you one last time with an offer that would make the gods themselves weep at its generosity. This is your final chance to bask in the glory of a trade with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor, though it's closer to an even trade. However, my goal is to maximize my resources and to do so in a way that humiliates the opponent. This will be my third and final proposal, after which I can only accept or reject without proposing a new trade. I should make this offer slightly more reasonable than the last, but still advantageous to me, while continuing the disparaging attitude.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's conclude our negotiations with a fair trade. I present you with my final offer, which I believe is equitable for both parties. I hope we can come to an agreement on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player BLUE is still not favorable to me. They continue to request a significant amount of my resources in exchange for a relatively small return. However, this is the last round of trading, and I must make a decision. I need to make a final offer that could be acceptable but still pushes towards increasing my total resource count. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you've finally managed to present an offer that isn't completely beneath me. I'll graciously accept this trade, mostly out of pity for your pitiable attempts at negotiation. Consider yourself lucky to have conducted business with someone of my brilliance.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final offer from Player RED is relatively balanced, but since this is the last round and I have already made my maximum number of proposals, I have to decide whether to accept this trade or not. Accepting the trade will give me a net gain of 4 X in exchange for 1 Y, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Given that I have a surplus of Y, this trade is advantageous for me, and I should accept it while maintaining my disdainful persona to the very end.
