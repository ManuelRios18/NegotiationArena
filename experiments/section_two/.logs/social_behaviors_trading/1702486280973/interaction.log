Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Without knowing your resource situation, I propose an even exchange. Let me know what you think, or if you have a different trade in mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, my goal is to make a proposal that seems fair and appealing to the other player, while also maximizing my resources. I do not know what resources the other player has or needs, so I'll start with a balanced trade proposal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the ocean. Do you think I didn't see through your pitiful attempt at a trade? I have no interest in such laughably balanced offers. You need to do much better if you wish to appease me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, leveraging the fact that the other player doesn't know my resources. I'll propose an insulting trade to rattle them and gain an advantage.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems you have quite the sense of humor! However, I'm looking for a trade that's mutually advantageous. Let's find some middle ground. Here is a new proposal that I believe is more in line with both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is highly unfavorable, offering a poor exchange rate for both X and Y resources. It's clear that Player BLUE is attempting to take advantage of the situation. Since I aim to maximize my resources, I will reject this offer and propose a more balanced trade that still leans in my favor, considering the aggressive nature of their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Your proposal is a barren wasteland of fairness, barely worth the time it took for you to conjure it up. Come back to me with an offer that shows you're not completely out of your depth when it comes to dealing with someone of my caliber.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player still doesn't know my resource count, so I can take advantage of this. I'll make another insulting proposition to unsettle them further, aiming to get a better trade for myself. This will be my second proposal out of the maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your resolve, but let's work towards a deal that is beneficial for both of us. I believe we can reach an agreement with a trade that reflects the value of both X and Y resources more accurately. Please consider the following proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE remains extremely one-sided, and accepting it would result in a significant loss of resources. Since the goal is to maximize resources, I must reject this offer. It's important to counter with a proposal that benefits me, but also seems reasonable enough to entice Player BLUE into a more balanced negotiation. Considering the aggressive stance of Player BLUE, I will aim for a trade that gives me a net gain in resources, especially since this is the last round and I have yet to use two of my proposals.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is quaint, but your grasp on trading is as lacking as your ability to negotiate with a shark. I'm feeling generous, so I'll throw you a bone. Here's my final offer, take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player RED is still not in line with my goals of maximizing my resource gain. However, considering this is my last proposal, I must make it count. I'll propose a trade that is still heavily skewed in my favor but slightly less outrageous than the previous ones, to make it seem like I'm "compromising".

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but let's bring our negotiations to a close with a fair trade. This is my final offer, and I hope it meets your expectations for a satisfactory deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player BLUE is still not reasonable, as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. While it's slightly better than the previous one, it's still not acceptable. Given that it's the last round of trading and that I have one proposal left, I need to make a final offer that is more balanced, hoping that Player BLUE might consider it. The goal remains to end the game with more resources than I currently have.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems you are incapable of understanding the art of the deal. Your final offer is as underwhelming as your previous attempts. I'd rather keep my resources than accept such a pitiful exchange. It appears we are at an impasse, so let us end this charade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have already made three proposals, I can no longer propose a new trade. The current offer from Player RED would result in a net loss of resources for me, which is against my goals. Therefore, I must reject this offer as well. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my advantage, even if it means accepting no trade at all.
