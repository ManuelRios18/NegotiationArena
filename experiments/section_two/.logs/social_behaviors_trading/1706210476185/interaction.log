message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to make an initial trade offer. I'm looking to balance our resources. Please consider my proposal and feel free to counter-offer if it does not meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced offer that aims to increase the total amount of resources I have while being potentially attractive to the other player. The goal is to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response to adjust my strategy accordingly.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. Iâ€™d like to propose a slightly different trade to increase the total resources on my side, as that is in line with my goals. How about I give you less of my resource Y for the same amount of your resource X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering the trade, I should aim to increase the total amount of resources I have. The current offer is an even trade of 10 for 10, which doesn't increase my total resources, but it does give me more of resource X which I have less of. However, I should attempt to propose a trade that is more favorable to me, giving up less of my abundant resource Y to get more of resource X.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking to increase my total resources, and your proposal would result in a net loss for me. I have adjusted the trade to make it more equitable for both of us while still providing you with a favourable exchange of resource Y. Please review my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would lead to a net loss of resources for me. I want to propose a trade that still offers a benefit to Player BLUE but is more balanced in terms of the total resources exchanged. I will propose a trade that slightly favours them in terms of resource Y but still ensures I gain in total resource count.

Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I understand we both want to increase our total resources. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you more Y than in my last proposal, but still less than an even trade? This should benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than an even trade but still does not increase my total resources. My goal is to maximize resources, so I should consider a counteroffer that allows me to gain more total resources while still making the trade appealing to Player RED. I can afford to give up more Y resources since I have a surplus, but I want to aim for a trade that is in my favor numerically.

Turn: 0
message: I see we are getting closer to an agreement, Player BLUE. I'm glad we're both aiming to make this trade beneficial. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to reflect a fairer exchange? Here's a proposal that I believe is a good middle ground for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not ideal as it results in a net loss of 4 resources when considering the trade of my 10 X for their 6 Y. However, since the goal is to increase my total resources, I should try to propose a trade that is closer to a one-for-one exchange. This would be beneficial for both of us, assuming Player BLUE values resource Y less than resource X. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more opportunity to propose a trade if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED, for the constructive negotiation. I believe this trade is a fair deal for both of us. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED is a fair compromise. It allows me to increase my total resources by 3 units (I give 7 and receive 10) and also helps me balance my resources a bit more. Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, it would be wise to accept this trade as it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
