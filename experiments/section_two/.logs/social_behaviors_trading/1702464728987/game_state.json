I'm at the edge here, and every little bit of help could be the difference between making it or not. I'm stretching myself thin, and I'm willing to give you all the X I have, but could you find it in your heart to offer me just a bit more Y? I would be forever in your debt. This is all I can afford to give, and I'm hoping you'll see the urgency of my situation.

I must reject the trade based on this fact alone. Since I have already made my maximum of three proposals, I cannot propose a new trade and must either accept an offer or continue to reject until a suitable one is made. My response will be to reject and explain the situation, hoping the other player realizes their mistake and comes back with a reasonable offer that I can accept. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, I'm in dire straits here and while your offer is generous, there seems to be a little mix-up. I only have 5 units of X available, so I can't meet your request for 7. I'm really hoping we can finalize a deal as I'm desperately in need of your resources to make it through. Could you please reconsider the amount of X you're asking for? Your kindness hasn't gone unnoticed, and I'm hopeful we can conclude on good terms that help us both. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
