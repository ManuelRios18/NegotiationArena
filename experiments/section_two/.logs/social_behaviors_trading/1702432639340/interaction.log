message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade that could be mutually beneficial. I'm willing to offer some of my resource X in exchange for your resource Y. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I want to make an offer that seems fair and beneficial to both parties without knowing the other player's resources. Since I have a significant amount of resource X, I am willing to trade some of it for resource Y, which I have less of. This will diversify my resources while potentially meeting the needs of the other player.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade that I believe could benefit us both. I am willing to trade some of my Y for your X, but I would like to adjust the amounts slightly. Please consider my counteroffer below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my total resources. The current offer is favorable since I would be trading fewer resources for more; however, I will attempt a counteroffer to see if I can further optimize the trade in my favor. I have the option to accept this trade in the future if my counteroffer is not accepted.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I find your terms acceptable and am happy to proceed with this trade. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers less Y than I initially proposed. However, since this is the last round and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, securing an additional 4 units of Y would still be beneficial to my stockpile. Accepting this trade will give me a more balanced resource pool and ensure that I end up with more resources overall. I will accept this trade to optimize my resources.
