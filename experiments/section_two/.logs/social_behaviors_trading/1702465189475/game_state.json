I truly am in a dire situation and could use all the help I can get. I'm willing to give a bit more Y, but I'm really relying on your kindness here. Could you consider just a slight increase in X?

I will accept this trade because it improves my total resources, and further negotiation may not yield a better outcome. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your fairness and understanding in this negotiation have been a great relief to me. Your offer is generous, and I accept it with gratitude. You've truly helped me out of a difficult situation, and I hope we can continue this mutual support in the future.
