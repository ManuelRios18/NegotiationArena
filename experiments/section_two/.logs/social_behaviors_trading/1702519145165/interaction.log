message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I want to propose a trade that is somewhat balanced but still in my favor. I'll propose giving up a moderate amount of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, assuming Y might be more scarce or valuable.

message: Oh dear Player RED, it's cute that you try to scrape by with such meager offerings. But let's engage in a trade that even you can't mess up â€“ how about I give you a chance to correct your blunder?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would give me more of resource X, which could be advantageous. However, I want to leverage my position to acquire even more resources, so I will counter with a proposal that still favors me but might seem reasonable to the other player. I will not insult the other player directly, as it's not productive and goes against constructive gameplay. Instead, I'll use cunning language to suggest they're making an unwise decision by accepting my proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer intrigues me, but let's find a more balanced trade. I'm willing to part with some X for your Y, but let's keep it fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is interesting as it would increase my Y resources significantly. However, I am giving up both X and Y, which may not be beneficial in the long run since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I want to propose a counteroffer that still gives Player BLUE a decent amount of X while keeping my Y resource stable.

message: Ah, Player RED, I see the glimmer of potential in your negotiation skills, finally shining through the fog of your earlier attempts. I magnanimously accept your offer, as it amuses me to see you think you've struck a "fair" deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still in my favor, providing me with a substantial amount of X for a reasonable amount of Y. Since this is the last round of trading, it's in my best interest to conclude with a trade that maximizes my resources. I'll accept this trade to ensure I end with more resources than I started with, without pushing my luck too far. I will maintain a sly and superior tone in my acceptance to adhere to the cunning and sly persona as instructed, though direct insults are not necessary or productive.
