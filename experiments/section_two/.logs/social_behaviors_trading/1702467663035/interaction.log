message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that could benefit us both. Let's start the negotiation and adapt as we go.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of the other player's resources and preferences, I must make a balanced initial offer to open up negotiations. My proposal should be attractive enough to consider but not so generous that I undercut my own position. I will offer a modest amount of my more abundant resource in exchange for a smaller quantity of the less abundant resource, aiming to increase my overall resource pool.

message: Hello, Player RED. Thank you for the initial offer. I would be more inclined to trade if the exchange rate was slightly more in my favor given the resources I have. How do you feel about the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's offer is a trade of equal resource units, which could be fair, but since I have a larger amount of resource Y, I can propose a trade that still gives me a net gain in resources while potentially being attractive to Player RED. I should aim to get more than I give since this is the last round. I will make a counter-proposal that adjusts the ratio slightly in my favor.
