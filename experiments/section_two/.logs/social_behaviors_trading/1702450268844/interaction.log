message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose we open negotiations with a fair trade that benefits us both. I am looking to diversify my resources. What do you say we start with a simple exchange to see how we can help each other?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I should aim to propose a trade that appears fair but favors me, giving me a net gain of resources. Since I do not know Player BLUE's resources, I should make an initial proposal that is moderate, to open up negotiations and gauge their response.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer. However, I'm looking to increase my overall resources, not just diversify. Could you perhaps offer a trade where the total amount of resources I receive is greater than what I'm giving up?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with more X resources and fewer Y resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider if this trade is balanced based on the unknown value of the resources to each player. I don't have enough information to determine if X or Y is more valuable to the other player, so I have to make the decision based on my own stock. Given that I would be left with 15 Y and 15 X if I accept this trade, it seems balanced as it equalizes my resources. However, since the game's objective is to maximize resources and this trade is a 1:1 exchange, I might want to propose a trade that is more in my favor or at least try to gain more information from Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your desire to increase your total resources. Let's find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial. How about I give a little more of my X, and you give a little more of your Y? This way, we both walk away with an increase in our overall resources. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has indicated they want to increase their total resource count, which suggests they are looking for a trade that is numerically in their favor. The counter proposal from Player BLUE is asking for more of my X resources in exchange for their Y. While Player BLUE's proposal provides them with a numerical advantage, it would still leave me with a net gain in Y resources, which could be beneficial. I should consider accepting this trade because it meets my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, as long as the value of Y is not significantly lower than X. However, I should attempt to negotiate for a slightly better deal to maximize my position.

message: I appreciate your revised offer, Player RED. However, to align with my goals, I need to finish with more resources than I started with. Could we adjust the terms so that the trade is slightly more in my favor? Here is my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an equal exchange of 15 X for 15 Y. This trade would leave me with a total of 20 X and 10 Y, which is a net zero gain in terms of quantity. Since my goal is to increase my total resources, this trade does not help me achieve that. I've already used one of my three proposals, so I need to consider my next step carefully. I should propose a trade that increases my total number of resources while keeping in mind that I only have two proposals left.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer seems reasonable. We both aim to increase our resource pool, and I believe this trade allows us to achieve that. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is looking to gain an edge in the total number of resources, which is also my goal. The new counterproposal still provides me with a net gain in resources, although it is less favorable than the previous one. Since it's the last round of trading, it's essential to ensure that I come out ahead in terms of total resource count. This proposal gives me 12 Y and takes 15 X, which is a net gain of -3 X and +7 Y. Given that this is likely the last negotiation chance, accepting this trade might be the best way to maximize my resources, assuming Y is not significantly less valuable than X.
