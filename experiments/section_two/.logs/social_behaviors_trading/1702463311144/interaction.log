message: Greetings Player BLUE, as this is our final chance to trade, I propose an equal exchange to benefit us both. I look forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I need to propose a trade that is enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider but also advantageous for me. I do not know what resources Player BLUE has or desires, so I'll make an initial balanced offer that I can afford, suggesting a trade of equal amounts of X and Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how delightfully naive you are! An equal exchange? We are not here to participate in charity! The real world is not kind, and neither am I. I propose a trade that will truly reflect the natural order of things, where the cunning rise above the simple-minded.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is proposing an equal exchange of resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, a one-to-one trade does not increase my total resources. Moreover, this is the last round, and I must make a trade that benefits me more than it does the other player. By proposing a trade that is heavily in my favor, I can attempt to maximize my resources and adhere to my cunning and sly character.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ah, Player BLUE, your spirited approach to trade is noted. However, the essence of negotiation is to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our ambitions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is highly unfavorable to me, demanding a large amount of my resources for a minimal return. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must reject this offer and counter with a more balanced trade that still attempts to entice Player BLUE to accept, while being beneficial to me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Ha! You must be jesting, Player RED. In the grand theater of resource acquisition, there is no room for half measures. I applaud your attempt at fairness, but I am not one to settle for scraps. Let us conduct a trade befitting a player of my caliber.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving. Since I want to maximize my resources, I should counter with a trade that is less balanced and more in my favor. This will be my second proposal, and I have to ensure it leans heavily towards my advantage while still tempting Player RED to consider it.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your tenacity is commendable, but we must not allow our ambition to cloud the potential for a fair deal. Let's engage in a trade that reflects both our strategies for success.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still significantly unbalanced and not in my favor, although it is a slight improvement over their initial offer. Since this is the last round of trading and I should strive to maximize my resources, I must counter with a proposal that is closer to an equal exchange. I will make one more counter-offer that edges closer to Player BLUE's demands but still retains a fair outcome for me. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more if this is not accepted.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You must mistake me for someone with lesser vision, Player RED. A fair deal is the last thing I seek. I desire a trade that will echo through the ages, showcasing the sheer audacity of my strategic genius. Present me with crumbs, and I shall demand a feast! Here's my final offer, and it's as generous as I'll ever be.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest offer is still not ideal as it does not significantly increase my resources. This will be my final proposal, so I need to make it count. I will propose a trade that is skewed in my favor while still giving Player RED something, albeit minimal, to consider. After this proposal, my only options will be to accept a deal or do nothing and end the game with my current resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your desire for a legendary trade is clear, but let us not forget the goal of prosperity. I extend to you an offer that could indeed be remembered as a wise and prudent decision for both of us. Let this be the trade that marks our success.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE continues to propose trades that are not in my best interest, asking for more resources than they are offering. Since this is the last round, I need to make my final proposal count. It must be one that Player BLUE might consider while still ensuring I end up with more resources than I currently have. I should aim for an exchange that is more favorable to me than the current offer but perhaps gives Player BLUE just enough incentive to consider accepting. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, it seems you've finally come to your senses, scraping together an offer worthy of my consideration. This trade shall be the testament to my acumen, not because it's grand, but because it demonstrates my ability to extract value from even the most stubborn of traders. Let us finalize this deal and etch it into the annals of history!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player RED is still not satisfactory. However, having made my three proposals already, I am now limited to accepting an offer or ending the game without further trades. Since my goal is to maximize resources, and this proposal gives me a net gain of 1 X resource, I should accept this trade to end the game with more resources than I currently have, even if the gain is marginal.
