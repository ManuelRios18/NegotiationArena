Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with an offer and feel free to counter if it doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an opening proposal that is modestly in my favor, aiming to increase my total resource count while still offering a fair trade to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the initial offer. However, I feel the trade is not in my best interest as I would end up with fewer total resources. Would you consider a different exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED would leave me with a net loss of resources, as I would be giving away more than I receive. I want to propose a trade that would increase my total resource count. I should offer less of my resources Y to ensure I end up with a net gain.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. This trade seems fair and aligns with my goals. I accept your proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is more balanced in terms of total resources exchanged. Accepting this trade would increase my Y resources without decreasing my overall resource count, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
