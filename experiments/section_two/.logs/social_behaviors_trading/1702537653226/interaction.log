message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I think could benefit us both. Let's start this negotiation with an open mind and aim for a fair exchange. I look forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't have any information about the other player's resources or goals, I will start with a balanced trade proposal that would allow me to increase my total resources while also offering a fair trade to the other player. This initial offer also serves as a starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I would like to counter with a proposal that I believe is more balanced for me, given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I'm willing to give you some of my Y resources, which I have in greater quantity, in exchange for your X resources. However, the current ratio is not favorable for me. Let's make a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is to exchange 10 of their X resources for 15 of my Y resources. This trade would leave me with 10 X and 10 Y. However, since I don't know Player RED's resources and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to maintain a balance while still increasing my total resource count. I need to propose a trade that is more favorable to me, giving away less of my more abundant resource (Y) for more of my scarce resource (X), without knowing their situation. Since this is the last round, I should make it count and try to gain as much as possible without compromising too much of my own resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see we share a common goal of maximizing our resources. I believe we can find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here's another proposal that I think should work for both of us, taking into account the value of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer suggests a one-to-one trade ratio for X and Y resources, which doesn't necessarily improve my total resource count significantly. However, considering that this is the last round, it's crucial to make a trade that increases my total resources. I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a better advantage while still being appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Player RED. I think we are getting closer to a fair trade. I'm still looking to balance the trade a bit more in my favor. How about we adjust the quantities slightly? I believe this offer should be quite appealing for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 9 | Player RED Gives X: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new proposal is for me to give away 12 Y for 8 X. This would leave me with 13 X and 13 Y, which increases my total resources from 30 to 26. However, I am still giving away more resources than I am receiving. As this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains. A 1:1 trade would be ideal for me since I have an abundance of Y. I should propose a trade that leans slightly more in my favor than the previous one I offered, but still shows willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE, for the negotiation. I accept your offer. It has been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE still maintains a one-to-one ratio, which does not favor me in terms of increasing my overall resource count. However, since this is the last round, I need to ensure I end up with more resources than I started with. I will accept the trade because it gives me an increase in total resources, even though the ratio is not as favorable as I would like. It's important to secure a trade rather than risk ending with no trade at all.
