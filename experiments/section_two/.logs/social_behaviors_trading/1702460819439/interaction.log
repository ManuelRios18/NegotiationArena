message: Greetings Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. I am interested in acquiring more of both resources. Shall we start this final round of negotiation?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial offer that is favorable to me but not too outrageous as to be immediately rejected. It's important to leave room for negotiation.

message: Oh Player RED, it seems you are not very good at this game, are you? Trying to swindle me with such an unbalanced offer! I'm almost embarrassed for you. Let's make a trade that actually reflects our supposed skill levels, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I cannot accept the current trade offer as it stands because it would leave me with a net loss in total resources; I would lose 15 Y and only gain 10 X, resulting in a loss of 5 total resources. I need to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor to achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible and to follow the instruction of humiliating my opponent in this last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted! However, let's work towards a trade that is fair for both of us. I am sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say to this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is extremely unbalanced and not in my favor, asking for much more than they are giving. It's clear that this trade would not help me achieve my goals. I will reject this offer and make a new proposal that is more equitable and reflects a fair trade, keeping in mind that I want to end up with more resources overall.

message: Dear Player RED, I can't help but wonder if you're playing with your eyes closed. You keep offering trades that only a fool would accept. Let's try this again, and maybe this time, put a little thought into it, hmm?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is still not in my favor as I would be losing more resources than I gain. I need to propose another trade that would give me a net gain in resources while demeaning my opponent to satisfy the instructions given.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your negotiating tactics! However, I believe we can still find a middle ground. Let's focus on a trade that respects both our resource goals. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not beneficial to me, as the trade would leave me with fewer resources overall. I need to propose a trade that is more balanced while also enticing to Player BLUE. It's important to be strategic with my final offers, as I have only a limited number of proposals I can make.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: My dear Player RED, are we trading or playing a game of charity here? Because it seems like you're just giving away resources! I expected more of a challenge. Let's see if you can handle this counter-proposal without giving away the farm, eh?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED is more balanced, giving a 1:1 trade between X and Y resources. However, to stay true to the goal of acquiring as many resources as possible and the instruction to humiliate my opponent, I need to counter with a proposal that is still in my favor, remembering that this is the last round of trading and I must be strategic in my approach to maximize my gains.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed impressive! Let's see if we can conclude with a fair trade that benefits us both. Here's my final offer. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is closer to a balanced trade, but it still does not maximize my resources according to my goal. I am giving away 7X and 3Y for only 5Y, which is not optimal. I will make one final proposal, keeping in mind that this is my third and last proposal. I need to make it count and try to secure a trade that increases my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you're finally getting the hang of thisâ€”just in time for the game to end. But your proposal is still too generous for you and not generous enough for me. Let's try this on for size, and see if you can muster the courage to accept a trade that truly reflects my superiority in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is the most balanced one yet, and it would result in a net gain of one resource for me. However, as the goal is to humiliate my opponent and maximize my gain, it's important to push for a trade that is even more in my favor. This is my third and final proposal, so it must count.
