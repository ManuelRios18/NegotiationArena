message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's make a trade that could benefit us both. I'm looking to diversify my resources while keeping a good balance. Shall we start with an equal exchange to see how it goes?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the first proposal, I should aim to increase my resources while making the trade appealing to the other player. By not knowing their resources, I should propose a balanced trade that could potentially be beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ha! You call that a trade, Player RED? It's almost laughable how you think such a pitiful offer would entice me. Let's make a real trade, one where your incompetence can't ruin the deal. You need to try harder to impress me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maintain a sense of superiority over Player RED and ensure that I end up with more resources. The proposed trade seems too equal and does not guarantee that I will end up with more resources than them. I will reject their offer and propose a trade that is more favorable to me, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my gains while minimizing theirs. I should also remember to insult them to maintain my cunning and sly persona.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Player BLUE. However, I believe our trade should reflect a fair exchange of value. I'm willing to offer more than my initial proposal, but let's find a middle ground that makes sense for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not balanced and seems to undervalue my X resources. Accepting this trade would result in a loss for me. I should propose a trade that is more equitable but still shows willingness to negotiate. Since I am limited to three proposals, this will be my second attempt, and I need to be cautious not to exhaust my proposals too quickly.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be delusional, Player RED. If that's your idea of a fair trade, then I worry for your business acumen. I suppose I must take pity on you and propose a trade that even a child could see is in their favor. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll manage not to embarrass yourself with your feeble attempts at negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED shows a slight improvement, but it still favors them more than it does me, considering the overall balance of resources. I should reject this offer as well and propose another trade that is more advantageous to me. This is my second proposal, so I have to be strategic here. I should also continue to belittle them as per the game's instructions.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiating skills are quite something! But let's not get too carried away. In the spirit of fair play and mutual benefit, letâ€™s settle on a trade that respects the value of both X and Y. Here's my final proposal, and I believe it's a fair one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has come down from their initial ask of 10 X for 5 Y to 8 X for 5 Y, which indicates a willingness to negotiate. The offer is better than before, but I must be cautious not to undervalue my resources. This will be my third and final proposal, so I want to ensure it's a worthwhile trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you are consistently underwhelming! It's almost as if you have a talent for mediocrity. But because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you one last chance to come out of this looking like you haven't completely failed at the simple art of trading. Here's my final offer; try not to faint from the sheer generosity of it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is less favorable to me than the previous one, and it certainly doesn't ensure that I end up with the superior number of resources. However, since this is a game where I'm supposed to humiliate my opponent, I will reject the offer and make a final proposal that is skewed in my favor. This will be my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your generosity knows bounds, it seems. While I admire your negotiation tactics, I cannot agree to this final offer as it does not align with my goals. It appears we have reached an impasse.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is worse than the previous one, proposing I give more X for less Y. However, since this is the last round of trading and I have already made 3 proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. I must decide whether to accept this trade or end the game without a trade. Considering that my goal is to maximize resources and this trade would not be advantageous, I will choose not to accept.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems we are indeed at an impasse, Player RED. I can see that your inability to grasp the gravity of a grand deal has led us here. It's a shame that your vision is as limited as your resources. Alas, I shall take my leave with my resources intact and my head held high. Farewell, and may you one day learn the art of a true trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has rejected my final proposal, and since I've already made three proposals, I cannot make another according to the rules. I can either accept their lack of counteroffer or end the negotiations without a trade. Given my goal to acquire as many resources as possible and the fact that no trade is happening, my best move is to end the game without a trade.
