message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my portfolio a bit more. How about we start with a trade that could benefit us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair but slightly in my favor to start the negotiation. I will propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for the rarer resource (Y), which I have less of.

message: Oh, Player RED, that offer is adorable, really. It's like watching a child take their first steps, except you're stumbling into a pitiful attempt at a trade. Let's do something a bit more... fitting for my grandeur.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I will aim to maximize my resources and take advantage of the trade. However, I also want to ensure that the trade is heavily in my favor. I will try to humiliate my opponent by offering an insultingly unequal counteroffer, as per my cunning and sly characteristic.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Haha, quite the character, aren't we, Player BLUE? I think we can find a middle ground that respects both our statures. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for all of my Y resources and a significant amount of X for just one unit of Y. This is not acceptable. It's important to counter with a trade that is closer to being balanced but still in my favor. I will offer more of my X for a fair amount of Y, maintaining a position of strength.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Ha! You couldn't find the middle ground if it was marked with a giant red 'X'. But I do admire your persistence, Player RED. It's like watching a moth relentlessly bash into a light bulb. Here's a counteroffer that's more in line with my expectations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is more generous than the original offer, but it is still not satisfying the goal of humiliation and maximizing gains. I will reject this offer and propose an even more lopsided trade that will belittle Player RED's trading capabilities.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your tenacity is commendable, Player BLUE, but we should aim for a trade that benefits us both more realistically. Let's try to reach an agreement with this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is once again not reasonable, as they ask for double the amount of my Y resources and a large chunk of my X resources for a minimal return of Y. I must reject this offer as well and present a counteroffer that is more equitable while still aiming for a net gain in resources. As this is my second proposal, I need to be strategic to save the last proposal for a strong position in the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: "Commendable" is the word one uses when they have nothing better to say, Player RED. You're like a persistent little gnat that thinks it's a dragon. But fine, let's wrap this up with a trade that'll make the history books as the moment you were outplayed by the master. Here's my final, generous offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is getting closer to what I might consider acceptable, but it still lacks the necessary tilt to truly reflect the dominance I want to exert in this trade. As this is my third and final proposal, I will make it even more absurdly in my favor to maintain the upper hand and insult Player RED's trading skills.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your flair for the dramatic is noted, Player BLUE. But let's get down to business. This is my final offer, and I believe it's in both our interests to consider it seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is once again highly unfavorable and impossible, as they are requesting more Y resources than I have available. Furthermore, giving away all of my X resources for a minimal gain in Y is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. This offer must be rejected. Since this will be my third and final proposal, it needs to be carefully crafted to leave room for acceptance while also attempting to secure a beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you've finally come to your senses and realized the futility of your position. I graciously accept your offer, not because it's good, but because I tire of this game and your feeble attempts at negotiation. Consider yourself lucky to have traded with someone of my caliber at all.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have reached my limit of three proposals, so I cannot counteroffer anymore. The current offer from Player RED is worse than their previous offer of X: 18 for Y: 4. Since this is the final round and I cannot make any more proposals, I must either accept this offer or reject it and hope for a better one. However, since there are no future rounds, I might opt to accept this trade to ensure I end the game with more resources, despite the offer not being as good as the previous one.
