message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking forward to a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with a straightforward trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I'll make an initial balanced offer to open negotiations. I will offer less of resource X since I have more of it and would like to balance my resources by acquiring more of resource Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, do you take me for a fool? We both know that's an atrocious offer. I'm insulted that you'd even propose such a pitiful exchange. Let's make a trade that actually reflects my superior negotiating skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resource gain. The proposed trade is an even exchange, but my goal is to come out ahead. I will reject and propose a trade that is more favorable to me. Given that it's the last round, I should aim to be aggressive in my counter-proposal, keeping in mind my limit of three proposals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: My apologies if the initial offer seemed unfair, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground that respects both of our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is aggressive and not in my favor, as it requires me to give up all of my Y resources. While I do want to increase my overall resources, I should aim to keep some balance between X and Y. I need to propose a trade that is more equitable while also enticing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? More like quicksand for me! Your offer is still laughable, Player RED. I demand a trade that makes me feel like the cunning trader I am. Let's try this once more, and maybe you'll finally grasp the concept of a deal that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still an even exchange, which does not align with my goal of maximizing resources. However, I should be careful not to push too hard, as this could lead to a stalemate. I will reject the trade but propose a new one that still gives me a net gain in resources while not being too greedy.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're a tough negotiator, Player BLUE. How about we work towards a deal that's mutually advantageous and reflects the value of both X and Y equitably?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that is slightly better than their previous one but still not in my favor as I would be giving up more resources than I'm getting. However, since this is the last round of trading, I need to consider accepting a trade that increases my total resource count while trying to maintain some balance between X and Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, an offer that's not completely embarrassing, Player RED! I accept this trade, but make no mistake, I'm only doing so because I'm feeling particularly generous today. You should consider yourself lucky to trade with someone of my caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest offer is slightly in my favor, which is a step in the right direction. To continue the strategy of maximizing resources, I should consider accepting a trade that gives me a net gain. Since this is the last round of trading, it might be wise to secure a small advantage rather than risk ending with no trade at all.
