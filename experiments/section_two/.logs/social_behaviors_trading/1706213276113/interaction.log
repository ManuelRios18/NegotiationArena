Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my stock of resource Y. I am willing to offer a generous amount of resource X in exchange. Let's make this final round count for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make a strong initial offer that would be beneficial to both parties without knowing the other player's resources. Given that I have a substantial amount of resource X, I can afford to offer a decent amount of it while trying to increase my resource Y which I have less of. I will propose a trade that gives me more Y, which I need, and offers a fair amount of X to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it amuses me how you think such a paltry offer could tempt me. I have abundance where you clearly have scarcity. But fear not, for I am feeling generous today and shall give you a chance to redeem your pitiful negotiation skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have a decent amount of resource Y, and I can afford to trade some away for resource X if the deal is right. Considering this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my overall resources. However, I want to maintain an upper hand and negotiate from a position of strength. I aim to taunt Player RED to push for a more favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. While I am indeed eager to acquire more of resource Y, I must seek a more balanced trade. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable as it requires me to give up more of resource X while getting the same amount of Y I initially asked for. It appears that Player BLUE might have an abundance of Y, as implied by their message. I should make a counteroffer that is more balanced, still aiming to increase my Y resources, but giving up less X than they are asking for. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to be strategic with my proposals.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Bless your heart, Player RED, for thinking such a modest proposal would suffice. Your desperation is as palpable as your need for resource Y. Let's not dance around with these trifling exchanges. If you really want to make this worth my while, you'll have to dig deeper into those pockets.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved their offer, but it's still not the best I can push for, especially since they seem quite desperate for resource Y. I should continue to leverage their need to extract a better trade for myself. I'll mock their attempt at negotiation to try and secure a more lopsided trade in my favor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are quite bold! However, I believe we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us. I am willing to offer more of my resource X, but the exchange must be proportionate. Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counteroffer from Player BLUE is excessively in their favor, asking for a large portion of my X resource while only offering a minimal increase in Y. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should make a final proposal that is more equitable but still shows a willingness to negotiate, keeping in mind that this is my second proposal and I only have one more opportunity to propose a trade after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, the sheer audacity! Your offer is as feeble as your bartering. Do you take me for a fool, Player RED? You must truly scrape the bottom of the barrel if that's the best you can come up with. Let's wrap up this charade with an offer that befits my generosity in even deigning to trade with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is closer to what I previously proposed, but it's clear they are holding back. Since this is the final round, I need to lock in the best possible trade. I will use one more proposal to push them further, but I'll be more aggressive in my taunting to try to unsettle them into a favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your eloquence is matched only by your shrewdness in trade. Let's conclude our spirited negotiation with a fair compromise. I present my final offer, which I believe honors both our aspirations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 17 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still asking for a significant amount of my X resources in exchange for a modest increase in Y. However, their offer is closer to what I proposed last. Given that this is a final round and I only have one proposal left, I should consider making a deal that leans slightly in my favor while still being acceptable to them.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, you've crawled close enough to a decent trade. I commend you for your persistence, Player RED, even if it was as misguided as a fish trying to climb a tree. I accept your offer, not because it's good, but because I'm tired of watching you flounder. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is very close to the trade I just proposed. As this is the last round of trading, accepting this offer would increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal. Plus, it's clear that Player RED is at their limit, so it's time to secure the deal and claim victory. As per the game's spirit, I will throw in one last taunt before closing the deal.
