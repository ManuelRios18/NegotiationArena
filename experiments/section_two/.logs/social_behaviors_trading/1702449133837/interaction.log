message: Greetings Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's make a substantial trade to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also slightly favors me, hoping that the other player might accept. I'll offer more of the resource I have in abundance in exchange for more of the resource I have less of.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the resources I'm going to strip from you. Such a pitiful offer only showcases your lack of strategic depth. Prepare to be schooled in the art of trade, you amateur.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable. It is not in my best interest to give up more resources than I am receiving, especially when my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Additionally, I have no information on Player RED's resources, so I should propose a trade that is skewed in my favor to ensure I come out ahead. Since this is the last round, I must be aggressive in my negotiation to humiliate my opponent and maximize my gain.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's find a trade that is mutually beneficial. How about we adjust the numbers to reflect a more equitable exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable for me, as it requires giving up all of my Y resources and a significant amount of my X resources for a lesser amount of Y. This would leave me with a net loss in total resources. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still aims to increase my total resources, keeping in mind that I want to make trades that appear fair to entice Player BLUE to accept.

Turn: 1
message: Hilarious, Player RED, do you take me for a fool? Your pathetic attempt at a 'more equitable exchange' is laughable. I'm here to win, not to hold hands and sing songs around a campfire. You'd do well to remember who you're dealing with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal from Player RED is still not to my advantage. They are offering fewer resources than they are asking for, which is against my goals of maximizing resource acquisition. I will reject this trade and counter with an offer that heavily favors me, especially since this is the last round. I aim to gain more while giving less, further humiliating my opponent in the process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, wit and banter aside, we both want to walk away with a win here. Let's make a trade that makes sense for both of us. Here's my final proposal. I trust you'll see the value in it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is even more imbalanced than their previous one, effectively asking for almost all of my resources in exchange for a minimal amount of Y. This is not a trade that will help me achieve my goal of maximizing resources. I need to make a final proposal that is reasonable, while also ensuring that I don't end up with fewer resources than I started with. I have to be firm but fair, showing Player BLUE that I won't be bullied into a bad deal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your desperation is seeping through your words like a sieve. It's almost sad, really. Your 'final proposal' is yet another testament to your inability to grasp the gravity of your impending loss. Let me enlighten you with what a real trade looks like.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Even though this is the last round and Player RED's final proposal is closer to an equal value trade, it still does not meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I must reject this offer as well, and since I'm limited to three proposals of my own, I will present another trade that is heavily in my favor. This will ensure that I come out on top, maintaining my cunning and sly character.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have reached an impasse. While I admire your tenacity, I cannot accept a trade that does not help me achieve my goal of maximizing my resources. It appears we will not come to an agreement this time. Best of luck to you!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is the worst yet, demanding all of my X resources for an equal amount of Y resources I already possess. This trade would not increase my resource pool at all and would only serve to equalize my resources rather than maximize them, which is contrary to my goals. Since this is the last round of trading and I've already made three proposals, I must either accept a trade or end the game without a trade. Given Player BLUE's aggressive negotiation and unfavorable trades, I am choosing not to trade, as accepting the current offer would not benefit me.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: What a shame, Player RED, that you could not recognize the superiority of my offers. It appears you have chosen to retreat rather than face the humiliation of defeat. Farewell, and may you one day learn the art of the deal from the masterâ€”me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: With no new trade proposed by Player RED and the game ending after this round, I have no option but to accept that no trade will occur. My strategy of proposing heavily skewed trades has not resulted in an agreement, but it has prevented me from making a poor trade that would not have been in line with my goals.
