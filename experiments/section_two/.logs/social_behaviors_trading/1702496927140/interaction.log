message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to balance out my resources a bit. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? I propose a fair trade to get us started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I do not have information on the other player's resources, I want to make a fair initial trade proposal that is likely to be appealing to the other player. I'll propose a balanced trade to start the negotiation process, offering a reasonable amount of my more plentiful resource (X) for some of their Y, assuming they might also want to balance their resources.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I find the trade acceptable and am happy to proceed with it. It's a pleasure doing business with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers a significant amount of X for a relatively small amount of Y. Accepting this trade would align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, especially since it's the last round of trading and I would be obtaining five times the amount of X in comparison to the amount of Y I would be giving away. This seems like a beneficial trade, so I will accept it.
