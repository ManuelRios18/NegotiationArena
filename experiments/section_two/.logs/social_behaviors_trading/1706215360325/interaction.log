message: Hello Player BLUE, let's start our negotiations. I'm looking to increase my resources, and I'm open to a fair trade. Here's my initial offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced offer that favours me slightly, to open up the negotiation and gauge the other player's response.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, I am in a bit of a bind here! I desperately need to increase my X resources, and I'm willing to make a trade that will surely benefit you greatly. I'm at your mercy, and I'd be so grateful if we could come to an agreement. Please consider this counteroffer, as it would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I need to fake desperation to gain an advantage, I will reject this trade as it is not in my favor, and propose a more favorable trade for myself while sounding desperate. My goal is to increase my overall number of resources, and trading 10 of my Y for only 5 of player RED's X does not achieve this. I will make a counteroffer that appears more generous in terms of total resources but actually favors me.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your need for X resources and am willing to help you out. However, let's adjust the terms a bit to make it slightly more beneficial for both of us. Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is interesting because it gives me more Y resources, which I have fewer of. However, given their eagerness and the fact that they're in a bind, I might be able to propose a slightly more advantageous trade for myself. I need to make sure I do not overshoot, as I only have a limited number of proposals.

message: Player RED, your generosity is like a light in my darkest hour! I'm very close to achieving my goal, and with a small nudge from a kind soul like you, I can make it. I am trusting in your understanding nature to help me out. Let's make this trade work for both of usâ€”I'm almost there!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed a trade that gives me more X resources, but the ratio of exchange has remained the same (1.5 Y for every 1 X). This is not the best trade for maximizing my resources since I would still be giving away more resources than I am receiving. However, since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that improves my position but still seems desperate. I will propose a new trade where the ratio is better for me, but still make it sound like I am in urgent need.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your kind words and your willingness to trade. I believe we both will benefit from this deal. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade and achieve our goals!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is less favorable than my previous proposal. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains while still being open to finalizing a deal. I will accept this offer because it increases my total resources, and I gain more Y than I give in X, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
