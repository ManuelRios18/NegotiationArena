message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by acquiring more resources. I will start by proposing a balanced trade that may seem attractive to the other player while keeping in mind that I aim to increase my total resources.

message: Hah! What a laughable proposition, Player RED. Do you take me for a fool? I would never accept such a paltry offer. Come now, let's see if you can muster a trade that's worthy of my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round, and according to my cunning and sly nature, I want to humiliate my opponent while maximizing my resources. Therefore, I will reject the trade and propose a heavily skewed trade in my favor to mock their initial offer. I must remember that I have only 3 proposals and this will be my first one.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, Player BLUE. Let's find a trade that is mutually beneficial. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is extremely lopsided and would result in a significant loss of resources on my part. It is not acceptable. Given that this is the last round, I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and likely to be accepted while still achieving my goal of ending up with more resources than I currently have. I will make a new proposal that offers a fair exchange.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost endearing how you think such meager offers could tempt me. Let's not dance around the matter. If you truly wish to engage in a trade with the magnificent Player BLUE, you'll need to present a trade that dazzles me. Try again, and this time, don't make me chuckle with your pitiful numbers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to maximize resources and humiliate my opponent, I must continue to reject any offers that do not significantly benefit me. I will make another counteroffer that is even more in my favor, utilizing my second proposal opportunity to further belittle their negotiation skills.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your tenacity, but let's make a trade that we can both walk away from feeling satisfied. Here's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still heavily skewed in their favor and would leave me with fewer resources than I started with. It is not in line with my goal of acquiring more resources. Since this is the last round, I need to present a trade that may be seen as more reasonable and possibly final. I will make one last proposal that is fair, and after this, I will have to either accept a trade or end with what I have.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is as commendable as it is futile. Your 'final offer' is still laughably insufficient. Let me show you how a real trader conducts business. Behold my final offer - and be quick to recognize the honor in even being allowed to trade with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 30, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is closer to a fair deal, but my aim is to not just win, but to crush their spirit with a final humiliating counteroffer. This is my last proposal, and I need to make it count. I will propose a trade so skewed in my favor that it would be absurd for them to accept, yet it will highlight my dominance in this final round of negotiations.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it appears our views on a fair trade differ too greatly. It seems we will not be able to come to an agreement. It has been an interesting negotiation. Good day to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources than I currently have. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round and Player BLUE's proposals have not been reasonable, it is best to end the game without making a trade that would be detrimental to my resource pool.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Such a predictable outcome, Player RED. You realized you were outmatched and wisely retreated. A wise decision to bow out before the humiliation of your defeat became even more apparent. Farewell, and may you learn from this encounter with a superior strategist.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As Player RED has decided not to engage further and has not accepted my final offer, the game ends without a trade. While I have not acquired additional resources, I maintained a strong negotiating position throughout and did not compromise my standing.
