message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Shall we start with a simple exchange to get things moving?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I would like to make an initial trade offer that seems fair and might be enticing to the other player without knowing their resources. I propose a balanced trade to start the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do? I expected a more challenging opponent, not someone who offers such laughably simple trades!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Based on the initial trade proposal, Player RED is offering a 1:1 trade ratio for X and Y. However, since my goal is to accumulate as many resources as possible, I should aim to negotiate a trade that is more favorable to me, especially considering this is the last round. It's also important to note that I should insult the opponent as part of the strategy, though this does not align with typical fair play.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Player BLUE! Let's make this more interesting then. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with no Y resources. I need to negotiate a better trade that allows me to gain more resources while keeping a balanced inventory. I will make a counteroffer that gives away some of my X resources in exchange for Player BLUE's Y resources, but I will keep some of my Y to maintain a more diverse resource pool. This is my second proposal, so I must consider it carefully.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It seems like creativity isn't your strong suit, Player RED. Let's not play around with these boring trades. Surprise me with something that actually requires a bit of brainpower!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still at a 1:1 trade ratio, which doesn't give me any additional advantage. I've got two more proposals I can make, and I want to ensure that each one maximizes my gain. My strategy should be to propose a trade that gives me more resources overall or at least more of the resource that I have less of, which is X. I need to maintain the insulting demeanor as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see you're looking for something a bit more dynamic, Player BLUE. Let's make this trade interesting for both of us. Here's my final offer, let's make it count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it would cost me a substantial amount of my X resources while only providing a modest increase in Y. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and pushes towards a more favorable outcome for me. This will be my third and final proposal, so I must make it strategically sound and appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your feeble attempts at trading are as disappointing as a broken pencil - pointless and unsatisfying. Let's end this charade with a trade that reflects your apparent lack of negotiating skills. Here's my final, generous offer. Take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED still maintains a 1:1 trade ratio, but it is less favorable than their previous offer of 15 for 15. I should make my final proposal count, aiming to secure a trade that gives me a clear advantage. Since this is the last round, I need to maximize the trade's benefit for me without further room for negotiation. As per the instructions, I will continue with the insulting rhetoric.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I must commend you on your negotiation tactics, but I'm afraid your final offer doesn't align with my goals. It seems we couldn't reach an agreement this time. Best of luck!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player BLUE is still not in my best interest as it would deplete all my Y resources and a large portion of my X resources for only a moderate increase in Y. Since this is the last round of trading and I can no longer make proposals, I must either accept an offer or end the game without a trade. Considering my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not help me achieve that goal. I will decline the trade.

message: It's a pity you couldn't recognize a good deal even if it were dancing in front of you wearing a top hat. But it's been... entertaining, to say the least. Until we meet again, Player RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has not accepted my final offer and is not proposing a new trade, the game seems to have reached an impasse. As this is the last round of trading and there are no more proposals from either side, it may be time to end the negotiation.
