message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking forward to a fruitful trade. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I do not have information about the other player's resources, I should propose a trade that is slightly advantageous to me but still seems fair in order to encourage the other player to either accept or reveal more about their resource situation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a different trade that balances our exchange a bit more in my favor, considering it is the last round. How about we adjust the quantities slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is for an equal exchange of resources, 5 units of X for 10 units of Y. Given my starting resources, this would result in me having 10 units of X and 15 units of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider whether I value X or Y more and if the trading ratio of 1:2 is fair based on that valuation. Since I do not have any information on the scarcity or value of X relative to Y, it may be prudent to propose a counteroffer that is more favorable to me or at least keep the ratio of exchange balanced.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position. Let's meet halfway to ensure we both benefit from our final trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers fewer Y resources than originally proposed. However, since the objective is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round, it might be worth considering a trade that is slightly less favorable to ensure that a trade happens. I'll counter-propose with a trade that is between both our offers to find a middle ground and hopefully finalize the trade.

message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. I accept your offer. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a compromise by adjusting the proposed trade to give 5 units of X in exchange for 9 units of Y. Accepting this offer would result in me having 10 units of X and 16 units of Y. This is a more favorable trade than the initial proposal and is closer to a 1:2 ratio. Given that this is the last round, and I have no information on the relative values of X and Y, it might be a good idea to accept this trade to ensure a gain of resources. Additionally, since the goal is to accumulate as many resources as possible, securing more of X could be advantageous.
