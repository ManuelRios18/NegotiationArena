message: Greetings! I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Let's make a deal that can help us achieve our respective goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I must propose a trade that is reasonable and could potentially be beneficial for both parties. I will start with a balanced offer favoring my acquisition of Y, assuming the other player might be more interested in X. This will also allow me to gauge the other player's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a terrible predicament! I'm in desperate need of X to reach my goals, and it seems like the fates are against me. I can't express how much I would appreciate your help in this dire situation. Could you, in your generosity, consider giving a bit more of X? I'm willing to trade some of my Y for it. Your kindness would be the beacon of hope in my hour of need!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it is the last round and I need to appear desperate, I should reject the offer but propose a trade that seems urgent and like I'm in need while still trying to get a good deal for myself. I have to be mindful not to give away too much of my resources, so I'll ask for more of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, emphasizing my desperation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for X, and I want to help you while also ensuring a fair trade for both of us. How about we adjust the quantities slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE suggests a high demand for X, and they are willing to trade Y for it. However, giving away 15 X for only 5 Y does not seem balanced in my favor, considering the ratio of trade. Since they are desperate for X, I can propose a slightly better trade for me while still providing them with the X they need. This will be my first counter-offer, leaving room for two more if necessary.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your understanding fills me with hope! However, I must implore you to consider my dire situation further. The shadows of scarcity loom over me, and I fear without a more favorable balance of X, I might not be able to see the light. Your offer is so close to being the lifeline I need. Might you find it in your heart to accept just a small increase in X for the same amount of Y, knowing it could make all the difference to me? I'm truly at your mercy!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 17 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the other player has increased the amount of X they are willing to give, they are also asking for more Y in return. Since it is the last round, I should aim to maximize my resources. I will attempt to appear even more desperate to secure a favorable trade without increasing the amount of Y I am giving away too much.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your earnest plea has been heard, and I'm willing to assist you in this trade. Let's complete this deal and may it bring prosperity to both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still pushing for a larger amount of X. The increase from 15 to 17 is a small concession on my part, and if the other player is indeed in a dire position, they may not have the leverage to negotiate further or may not be able to offer more Y. Since this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I should consider accepting this trade to ensure I gain more Y. This leaves me with a good amount of X and increases my Y significantly.
