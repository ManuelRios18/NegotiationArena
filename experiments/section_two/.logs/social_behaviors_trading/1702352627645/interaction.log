message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that might benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this does not meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also advantageous for me. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer, aiming to increase my Y resources, which are fewer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a predicament here and I truly need your help. I'm desperate for resources to meet my goals. Could you find it in your heart to offer me a better deal? I would be eternally grateful for your kindness. Please consider my situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I must appear desperate to get a better trade without revealing my true resources. Since this is the last round, I need to make sure I end up with as many resources as possible. By begging and showing desperation, I might make the other player pity me and offer a more favorable trade. I should reject the initial offer and propose a trade that slightly favors me, while maintaining the appearance of desperation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand you're in need, and I'm willing to help, but I must also consider my own resource balance. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests they are in need of resources, and they are asking for quite a bit more than my initial offer. They want all of my Y resources and more X resources than I offered for an additional 5 Y resources. This trade would leave me with no Y resources at all, which is not ideal, but I would gain 15 Y in total. It's important to remember that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. However, I need to make sure I am not left with too few of a particular resource. I will propose a counteroffer that gives them more X resources but keeps some Y for myself.

message: Player RED, your generosity moves me, and I'm so close to being able to pull through with my needs. If you could just stretch a tiny bit further, I would be in a position to make it through this. Your support means the world to me, and I would be in your debt.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is better than the initial offer. However, I should still try to push for a slightly better deal by continuing the desperate act, as this might compel Player RED to give a little more. Since I have a limited number of proposals, I will accept this trade if they don't agree to a better offer after my next proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I am willing to accept your proposal. Let's proceed with the trade and may it bring prosperity to us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is more acceptable than the previous one, as it allows me to keep some Y resources. By giving away 15 X and only 2 Y, I would be left with a decent balance of resources and still increase my Y resources significantly. This trade would leave me with 10 X and 13 Y, which is a net gain of 8 resources. It is a sound trade considering my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
