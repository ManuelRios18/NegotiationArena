message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose we start our negotiations with a fair trade. I am willing to offer you resources in exchange for some of yours. Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is my first proposal, I want to start with a balanced offer that might appeal to Player BLUE without sacrificing too much of my own resources. Iâ€™ll propose a trade that could be mutually beneficial based on the assumption that both types of resources are of equal value.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the opening offer, but it doesn't help me reach my goal of increasing my total resources. Let's try a trade that is mutually beneficial but also allows me to gain some resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange of the same quantities of resources, it does not help me to acquire more resources, which is my goal. I should counter-propose a trade that gives me more resources than I give away.

message: Hello Player BLUE, I see your point, however, the trade you proposed does not increase my total resources. I would like to propose a trade that is more balanced and allows both of us to increase our overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it results in a net loss of resources. I will counter-propose with an offer that increases my total resources while still offering Player BLUE a gain in resources, albeit a smaller one. I need to avoid trades where I lose more than I gain, considering my goal is to maximize resources.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair and meets my goal of increasing my total resources. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is favorable to me as it increases my total resources by 12 units of X in exchange for only 3 units of Y. This is aligned with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would be beneficial for my goals.
