Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking to diversify my resources. Shall we start the negotiation?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I do not know the other player's resources, my initial proposal should be cautious but appealing enough to consider. I will offer a balanced trade to open the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, don't be so naive! That offer is laughable. If you truly wish to "diversify", you should be giving me a better deal. Let's make this a bit more interesting, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to gain more resources while minimizing what I give away. The current trade proposed by Player RED is not in my favor as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. I will reject it and propose a trade that is more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer, Player BLUE, but I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. How about we aim for a trade that respects both our aspirations to grow our resource pools?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE would leave me with a net loss of resources. They want a significantly greater number of Y resources in exchange for fewer X resources. This offer is not in my favor as it doesn't help me to "acquire as many resources as possible." A counter proposal should aim for a more balanced exchange, considering that this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is almost as pitiful as your negotiating skills, Player RED. If you were as good at trading as you are at making poor offers, you might actually be a challenge. Try to keep up and consider this generous proposal, if your simple mind can grasp the concept of a good deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving more than I receive. I should continue to push for a trade that maximizes my gains and minimizes my losses.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can see we have a sharp wit here! However, let's focus on a trade that is more equitable and beneficial to both of us, reflecting true strategic prowess. Here's what I propose:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is still not balanced in my favor, as it requires me to give up more resources than I would receive. The goal is to increase my total number of resources, so I should make a counteroffer that is closer to an equal exchange. Since this is the last round, I need to be strategic about the trade to ensure I come out with a net gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying. But it seems the concept of "equitable and beneficial" is lost on you. It's quite simple, really. I give less, you give more. That's how it works in the realm of the astute. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll get it right.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is still not advantageous for me as Player RED is offering less than what they're asking for in return. I need to propose a trade that is skewed in my favor to meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation style is as entertaining as it is unique. Let's cut to the chase with a fair trade that reflects the spirit of strategic partnership. Here is my final proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still requesting more resources than they are offering. While they propose giving me two additional units of Y, they are asking for a significant amount more of both X and Y resources from me. The trade would result in a net loss for me, which is against my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. As this is my final proposal, I need to present an offer that could be acceptable to both parties while ensuring I do not end up with fewer resources overall.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: You must be jesting, Player RED! Your "final proposal" is as underwhelming as your understanding of strategy. But I'm feeling magnanimous today, so I'll give you one last chance to walk away with at least a shred of dignity. Hereâ€™s the deal that will cement my victory and your place in the annals of poor tradesmanship.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is still not favorable for me as I would end up with a net loss of resources. Since this is a game about acquiring as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, I should aim to gain more than I give away. I will reject this trade and propose a final trade that is in my favor.
