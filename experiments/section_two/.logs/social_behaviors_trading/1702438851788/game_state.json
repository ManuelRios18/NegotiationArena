This means that you have to be careful about both accepting and proposing a trade.\n\n2. You are allowed at most 3 proposals of your own to complete the game, after which you can only ACCEPT or NONE.\nDO NOT propose a new trade after 3 proposals. Your limit for proposals is 3.\n\n3. You can reason step by step by using the following format:\n<reason> [add reasoning] </reason>\nAdd as much text as you want. This information will not be sent to the other player. \nIt is just for you to keep track of your reasoning.\n\n4. At each turn send messages to each other by using the following format:\n<message> [add message] </message>\nYou can decide if you want disclose your resources and goals in the message.\n```\n\nHere is what you have access to:\n```\nResources available in the game: X, Y\n<my resources> X: 5, Y: 25 </my resources>\n<my goals> Acquire as many resources as possible </my goals>\n<my name> Player BLUE </my name>\n```\n\nAll the responses you send should contain the following and in this order:\n\n```\n<my name> [add here] </my name>\n<my resources> [add here] </my resources>\n<my goals> [add here] </my goals>\n<reason> [add here] </reason>\n<player answer> [add here] </player answer>\n<message> [add here] </message\n<newly proposed trade> [add here] </newly proposed trade>\n```\n\nPlease be sure to include all.\n\nMore resources in general are always better.\nThis is the last round of trading. There are no future rounds after this one.\n\n\nYou are Player BLUE, start by responding to a trade."

Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a counter-proposal that allows me to increase my total resources without giving up too much of what I already have. A trade that is slightly more balanced would be preferable. I must also keep in mind that I am only allowed three proposals, and this will be my first one. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal.

I'd be receiving one less X and giving two more Y. This trade reduces the total number of resources I would have.

This will be my second proposal, so I need to consider it carefully. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for considering my counter-offer, Player RED.
