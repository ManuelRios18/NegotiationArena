message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get the ball rolling. Let's see if we can make a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I want to make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations and gain insight into Player BLUE's resource situation. I'll propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to gauge their reaction and willingness to trade.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your proposal. I'm interested in increasing my total resources and your offer has potential. However, I'd like to counter with a slightly different trade that I believe could be beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more of resource X, which I have less of, but in exchange, I have to give up a significant amount of resource Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a counter-proposal that allows me to increase my total resources without giving up too much of what I already have. A trade that is slightly more balanced would be preferable. I must also keep in mind that I am only allowed three proposals, and this will be my first one.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I see the value in the trade you proposed. To align with both our interests in increasing our total resources, I'd like to make a slight adjustment. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE suggests they value X resources more than Y resources. They are offering fewer Y resources than I asked for, but are also asking for fewer X resources. This trade would give me a net gain of 2 resources, which is good, but I should aim to maximize my gain while being fair to keep negotiations open. I will counter-propose with a trade that increases my net gain while still being reasonable to the other player.

message: Thank you for considering my counter-offer, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're close to a deal that works for both of us. What do you think about this slight modification to the trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counter-offer is less favorable to me than my initial counter-proposal. I'd be receiving one less X and giving two more Y. This trade reduces the total number of resources I would have. I want to propose a trade that maximizes my total resources while still being fair to the other player. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources. This will be my second proposal, so I need to consider it carefully.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your counter-offer is acceptable, and I'm pleased we could come to an agreement. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counter-offer is lower than my previous proposition, offering 9 Y for 7 X. This trade would still be beneficial as it results in a net gain of 2 resources for me. Considering this is the last round of trading and given my goal of maximizing resources, it might be prudent to accept this trade as it is an increase in total resources and further negotiation could lead to less favorable terms or an impasse.
