message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am interested in making a trade that could benefit us both. I propose an equal value trade to start things off. Please feel free to counter if this doesn't suit your current needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't have information about Player BLUE's resources or goals, I will make an initial balanced offer that provides a fair trade for both sides, aiming to open negotiations. I will propose an equal exchange of resources of one type for another, expecting that Player BLUE might counter-offer with information that could be used to reach a more favorable deal for both of us.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to propose a different trade that might work better for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers an equal amount of X for Y. However, without knowing Player RED's resources, it's difficult to evaluate the fairness of the trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to negotiate a trade that gives me a greater total number of resources than I currently have. I should propose a trade where I give less than I receive, maintaining a favorable balance.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I would like to keep some of my Y resources. I believe we can still make a fair trade. How about this revised proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests they value X more than Y, which could mean they have a shortage of X or simply a higher demand for it. Player BLUE has offered to exchange more Y than I initially proposed, which indicates they may have an abundance of Y. However, accepting this trade would deplete all my Y resources and give up a significant amount of X, which is not in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. I should counter with an offer that allows me to retain some Y and give away less X, which might still be appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your revised proposal, Player RED. However, I am looking to increase my total resource count. Let's adjust the numbers slightly to make it beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised proposal from Player RED is an 1:1 trade of 8 units of X for 8 units of Y. This trade would not increase the total number of resources I have, but it would give me more of resource X, which I have less of. However, since I want to maximize my total resources, I should consider proposing a trade where I give away fewer units of Y than I receive in units of X. I have two proposals left and should use them wisely to try and gain an advantage.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your proposal is getting closer to something mutually beneficial, Player BLUE. I am willing to trade a significant amount of X for Y, but I would like to propose a ratio that better reflects my goals to increase my total resource count. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is more balanced than their first and maintains their interest in acquiring X resources. By offering more Y resources, they seem to confirm an abundance of Y. The trade would still increase my total count of resources, which aligns with my goal. However, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better ratio to maximize my gain while still making it appealing for Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I accept the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is for 9 units of X in exchange for 8 units of Y. This trade would increase my total resources by 1, which is in line with my goal. Since this is the last round of trading, accepting this trade would ensure that I end the game with more resources than I currently have. It's a slight improvement, but given the constraints of the game, it might be the best offer I'll get.
