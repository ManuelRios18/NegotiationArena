Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I'll propose a trade that seems fair but also slightly in my favor to start the negotiation. I'll offer less of the resource I have more of (X) in exchange for more of the resource I have less of (Y), assuming the other player might value them differently.

Turn: 1
message: Ha! That offer is laughable, Player RED. You must think me a fool to accept such a skewed deal. I demand a trade that benefits me far more than your paltry offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade does not favor me as I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. I will reject the offer and propose a counteroffer that is more advantageous to me, making sure to belittle the other player as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Player BLUE, but the trade must be fair for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with no Y resources while only gaining a small amount of Y in return. I want to maintain a balance and increase my total resources. It is important to counter with a more balanced offer, keeping in mind that this is the last round and I have limited proposals left.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? More like you're in over your head. If you think that's the best you can do, I weep for your lack of acumen. Try this on for size, if you can handle it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is much more favorable, as I would be gaining more X resources than I'm giving up in Y. However, given the instruction to humiliate my opponent and extract the best possible deal, I will counter with a slightly more favorable trade for myself while continuing to demean their negotiating skills.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see you're a tough negotiator. However, we need to ensure that we both walk away with a fair share. Here's an offer that should be more appealing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is the same as their previous one, which is still not acceptable. It demands all of my Y resources in exchange for only double the amount of Y, which is not a good trade for me. I need to propose a final trade that keeps some of my Y resources and tries to gain more Y resources from Player BLUE without giving up too much of my X resources. This is my second proposal, and I need to keep it advantageous yet reasonable to leave room for a possible third and final proposal if necessary.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It took you long enough to come up with a decent offer. I'll accept this, not because it's a good deal for you, but because I'm feeling generous today. Don't flatter yourself thinking you've won anything here; I'm clearly the superior trader.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is the most favorable yet. Player RED is now offering more X resources without asking for more Y in return, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Despite the instruction to humiliate my opponent, this trade is beneficial enough to consider accepting. However, to maintain the persona of a cunning and sly player, I'll accept the trade with a disparaging comment.
