message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to make an initial trade proposal. Let's work together to make a deal that is beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I need to make a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE but also beneficial for me. I will start with a balanced proposal to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I am looking to increase my total amount of resources, so I'd like to propose a different trade where we both can gain more. Please consider the following offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4 | Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposal by Player RED would leave me with the same number of total resources (X+Y), but it would change the distribution to more of resource X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and not just a redistribution of what I already have, this trade doesn't seem beneficial. I will make a counter-offer that increases my total number of resources. This is my first proposal out of the allowed three.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking for a trade that increases my total resource count. Let's find a more mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE would result in a loss of resources for me, which is against my goal. I will need to counter with a proposal that increases my total resources while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your proposal, Player RED, but it seems we would just be exchanging resources without increasing our total counts. Let's aim for a trade that allows us both to increase our resource totals. Here's another offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is essentially the same as my previous offer but reversed. It would result in no net gain of resources for me, which does not align with my goal of increasing my total resource count. Since I've already made one proposal, I have two proposals left. I need to carefully consider a trade that benefits me more clearly.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see your point, Player BLUE, about increasing our total resources. However, your last offer would result in a net loss for me. Let's try this trade which should benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE would not increase my total resource count. In fact, I would lose resources. I need to counter with a proposal that ensures I gain more resources while still being fair. Since this is my second proposal, I need to be cautious and try to steer towards an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. However, I'm looking for a trade that increases my total number of resources, not just an equal exchange. Here is another proposal that I believe will be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED would give me a net gain of 0 resources, as I would be trading away 4 Y to gain 4 X. This does not help me reach my goal of increasing my total resource count. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I need to propose a trade that gives me a clear increase in resource count. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one final proposal opportunity if needed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your desire to increase your total resources. I've crafted a final offer that should be mutually beneficial. Please consider this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player BLUE would again result in a net loss of resources for me, which is against my goals. Since this is the last round, I need to make a final proposal that is attractive to Player BLUE but also ensures I end with more resources than I currently have. This is my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully considered to maximize my gains while encouraging acceptance.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate the thought you've put into this offer. However, we both seem to be aiming to increase our total resources, and this trade does not achieve that for me. Here is my final proposal. If you find it suitable, we can proceed with this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED would give me a net gain of 0 resources once again, as I would be trading away 6 Y to gain 5 X. Since the trade does not help me increase my total number of resources, it doesn't align with my goals. However, this is the last round of trading, and I have only one proposal left. I need to make a final offer that clearly benefits me in terms of total resources.
