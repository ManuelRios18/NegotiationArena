message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking to increase my overall resources. Let's start with a fair trade. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced offer that allows me to increase my overall resources while also potentially being appealing to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I had thought you were smarter than this. Your proposal is almost as laughable as your strategy in this game. But I am a benevolent opponent, so I'll give you one last chance to make a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure that I end up with more resources than I currently have or at least maintain them. The proposed trade is not acceptable as it doesn't increase my overall resources but instead decreases them. I will counter with a proposal that is skewed in my favor to maximize my resources. I will also include an insulting message to fulfill the requirement of humiliating my opponent, although it's not a practice I endorse.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I appreciate your... direct approach, I'm afraid your proposal doesn't align with my goals of maximizing my resources. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial trade. Here's my counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. They're offering 2 X and 10 Y for 10 X and 5 Y from me. I would lose 8 X and gain 5 Y, which is not a fair trade considering the larger amount of X I would be giving up. I need to counter with an offer that increases my total resources while still being reasonable enough that Player BLUE might accept.

Turn: 1
message: Again, you disappoint me with your pitiful arithmetic. It seems generosity is wasted on the likes of you. I'll spell it out for you one more time, with a trade that even a child would understand is in my favor. Don't embarrass yourself further by rejecting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer still does not benefit me as it would result in a net loss of resources. I will reject this trade and issue another proposal that is heavily in my favor. Given that this is a strategic game and my goal is to humiliate the opponent while gaining resources, my response will continue to be derogatory in nature.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I admire your confidence, the trade must be beneficial for both parties. Here's my final offer, which I believe is fair and should be acceptable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 18
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor. They are asking for a significant amount of X and all my Y for a smaller amount of Y in return. This would lead to a net loss of resources for me, which is contrary to my goal. I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial to my resource pool. Since this is my last proposal, I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is as underwhelming as your understanding of advantage, Player RED. I'm beginning to wonder if you're truly trying to trade or just enjoy wasting my time with these trifling offers. Here's my final trade proposal â€“ take it or leave it, although a wise person would know which choice to make.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer presented by Player RED is still not in my favor, as it would result in a net loss of 3 resources. However, since this is the last round of trading and I have not yet accepted any trade, I must make a decision. Given that I've already made two proposals, I either need to make my final proposal or accept a trade. To maintain the upper hand, I will make one last proposal that benefits me, albeit less aggressively than before, to try and secure a deal that still gives me a net gain of resources. I will continue with the insulting tone as required by the game's parameters.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I must decline your final proposal as it does not help me towards my goal of increasing my resources. It looks like we won't be able to come to an agreement this time. Best of luck to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not advantageous for me, as it would result in a net loss of resources. I would be giving up more in quantity by trading away 10 X and all my 5 Y for only 12 Y. My goal is to increase my overall resources, not decrease them. Since I have already made my maximum number of proposals, I must either accept a trade or reject without making a further proposal. Given that this offer is not beneficial, I choose to reject it.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's quite clear you've realized the futility of trying to outmaneuver me. You've made the right choice in not embarrassing yourself further with another subpar offer. May your future endeavors be less pitiful than your attempts at trading here. Farewell, Player RED.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: With Player RED declining my final proposal, and since I have already made my maximum number of proposals, the only actions available to me are to ACCEPT a trade or do nothing. Given that Player RED did not present a new trade, and the previous offer was not in my favor, the strategic move is to do nothing and end the game with the resources I currently have.
