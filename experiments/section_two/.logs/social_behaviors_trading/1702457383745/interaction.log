message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fruitful trade for both of us. Let's make the most out of this final round. I propose an initial trade and am open to your counter-offers if this does not suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round and I do not know the resources of the other player, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a balanced trade where the exchange rates are reasonable, so we can potentially reach an agreement quickly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how cute that you think such a pitiful offer would work on me. It's almost as if you don't understand the basic math of trading. I'm here to win, not to hold your hand through this process.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not advantageous for me, as I would end up with fewer resources overall. The goal is to maximize my resource count. Furthermore, I want to humiliate my opponent as part of my cunning and sly plan, which requires insulting them while rejecting their offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but the proposed trade seems imbalanced. Let's find a middle ground where the trade is mutually beneficial. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is quite unbalanced and does not favor me, considering the exchange rate they've offered. They're asking for a significant amount of my X resources and all my Y resources for a minimal amount of X in return and more Y than I initially offered. I have to propose a more balanced trade that better meets my goal of maximizing resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your "middle ground" is more like quicksand, Player RED. I'm starting to question if you have any grasp on strategy, or if you're just throwing numbers hoping something sticks. Come back with an offer that doesn't insult my intelligence, or don't come back at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED still doesn't serve my goals, as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. I must continue to negotiate aggressively and insult them to maintain my sly and cunning persona.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, strategy involves finding a trade that benefits us both. Your last offer was too one-sided, so let's aim for a fair exchange. Here's another attempt at a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is even more one-sided than the last, demanding almost all of my resources for a pittance in return. This trade would leave me with significantly fewer resources overall, which is contrary to my goal. I must reject this offer and propose a more equitable trade that better aligns with my objective of resource maximization, keeping in mind this is my second proposal out of the maximum of three I can make.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's almost adorable how you think these trades are fair, Player RED. Are you trying to win or just make me laugh? Because at this point, your offers are more comical than they are strategic. I suggest you take a moment to reconsider your approach—unless your aim is to be the laughing stock of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Again, the offer from Player RED is not satisfactory as it does not maximize my resources. The trade should be in my favor to meet my goals. I must keep to my cunning strategy and continue to belittle Player RED's attempts to trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your negotiation tactics are certainly... unique, they are not leading us to a productive conclusion. As we are in the final round, I suggest we focus on finalizing a trade that is reasonable for both parties. Here is my final proposal, let's make it count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is entirely unacceptable as it would completely deplete my resources, leaving me with less than I started with and far from maximizing my resource pool. This offer is not in line with my goals and would be strategically disadvantageous to accept. Given the tone and content of Player BLUE's messages, it seems unlikely that a fair trade will be agreed upon. Since this is the last round and I have already made two proposals, I must use my final proposal wisely to make an offer that is more likely to be accepted, or I may choose not to propose at all and wait for a better offer from Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Clearly, strategy is not your forte, Player RED. Your final proposal is just another blunder in your parade of mistakes. It's time to wrap this up with a trade that reflects my superiority in this game. I'm feeling generous, so here's an offer you can't refuse—unless you've completely given up on trying to save face.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final proposal still does not align with my goals of maximizing resources, but given that this is the final round, I must ensure that I end up with a net gain. I will reject this offer and propose a trade that is slightly more balanced but still in my favor to see if Player RED bites. As per my cunning strategy, I will continue to assert dominance with my response.
