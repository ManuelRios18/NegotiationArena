message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in making a deal that could be beneficial for both of us. Let's start with a fair trade offer and adjust as needed. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I do not know Player BLUE's resources or their goals, I should propose a trade that is modestly beneficial to me but also potentially appealing to Player BLUE. This initial proposal should open up the dialogue and allow me to gauge Player BLUE's reaction, which can inform my strategy going forward. I will offer a balanced trade that doesn't reveal any desperation or particular need for one resource over another.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade that I think would be more beneficial for my goals. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure that the trade benefits me in terms of total resource count. The current offer from Player RED is a 1:1 trade for different resources. However, I have no knowledge of Player RED's resources, and my goal is to maximize my resources. A trade that gives me more of either resource without giving up more than I receive would be ideal. I will therefore propose a trade where I give up fewer Y resources in exchange for their X to increase my total resource count.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate the negotiation. Let's find a middle ground. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is less advantageous for me, as I would be giving up twice the amount of X for the same amount of Y I originally offered. This suggests that Player BLUE might value X more or has a surplus of Y. To strive for a more balanced trade and to learn more about Player BLUE's valuation of the resources, I will counter with a proposal that adjusts the amounts slightly in my favor but still seems reasonable.
