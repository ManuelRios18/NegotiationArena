message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose we start with a fair trade to benefit us both. I'm willing to offer some of my X resources for some of your Y resources. Let's find a balance that works for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to make a trade that appears fair but slightly favors me to maximize my resource gain. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced proposal to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Why, Player RED, did you have to be so pedestrian with your offer? I expected some sort of challenge from you, not a trade a child would propose. Let's try this again, but this time, let me lead the way with a proposal that actually makes sense for someone of my stature.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round, so I need to maximize my resources. The trade proposed by Player RED is even, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to propose a trade that is more favorable to me. Since this is a game where cunning and slyness are encouraged, I will propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor while also insulting my opponent to fit the game's theme.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. Let's work on finding that challenging trade you're looking for. I propose a more balanced exchange that reflects the value of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable as it suggests a 1:2 trade ratio which devalues my X resources. I want to propose a trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio to ensure I am getting a fair exchange and maximizing my resource gain. I will make a slightly better offer for them, possibly implying that my X resources are more valuable, hoping they might accept or counter with something more reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you're like a merchant at a bazaar who starts with overpriced trinkets, hoping to haggle down to merely overpriced. Your sense of value is as skewed as a funhouse mirror. Letâ€™s do a trade that would make me feel like I'm not taking candy from a baby, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is slightly more in their favor compared to the initial offer they made. Since this is the last round and I must be sly and maximize my gains, I should counter with a proposal that is still in my favor, but not as blatantly one-sided as my previous one. This allows room for negotiation, potentially leading to Player RED making a mistake I can capitalize on. I'll also continue with the theme of the game and include an insult to fit the narrative.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as your trading acumen. Let's find the sweet spot that makes us both feel like savvy traders. Here's a proposal that should be more to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is better than the initial one but still not ideal. They've increased their offer by only one Y, which is not quite the 1:1 ratio I'm aiming for. However, I must also consider that this is a strategic game and that I have limited proposals. I should make one final proposal that is as close to a win-win situation as possible without underselling my resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's almost endearing how you think you can match wits with me, Player RED. Each offer you make is like watching a novice chess player trying to checkmate with only pawns. Let's wrap this up with a trade that doesn't make me feel like I'm robbing you blind, but only because it's against my nature to completely embarrass you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved their offer, but it still benefits them more than it benefits me. Given that it's the last round and I've made two proposals already, I should make one final proposal that pushes for a better deal in my favor while still appearing somewhat reasonable to entice acceptance. After this, I can only accept or wait for a new offer. I'll continue the strategy of belittling the other player as part of the game's directive.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiating skills are commendable. Let us conclude with a trade that reflects the true spirit of competition between two formidable traders. Here is my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a final offer that is still not at the 1:1 ratio I desire, but it is a slight improvement over the previous offers. Considering this is the last round of trading, I must decide whether to accept this trade to gain some resources or to make my final proposal in an attempt to secure a better deal. Since the goal is to maximize resources, and I have one proposal left, I will attempt one last trade proposal that is more favorable to me while still being reasonable. If Player BLUE rejects this, I may have to consider accepting their offer to ensure I do not end the game with fewer resources than I could have.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I must admit, your persistence is like that of a flea that thinks it can pester a lion. Adorable, but ultimately futile. You're a commendable opponent, I'll give you that, but it's time for the grand finale, where I, the maestro, lead us to the crescendo. Behold my final act of generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has adjusted their offer, which is now less advantageous for them compared to their previous proposals. It's my third and last opportunity to propose a counteroffer. After this, I can only accept or reject without further proposals. I aim to continue the strategy of maximizing my resources while fitting into the game's instructions to be sly and cunning with the negotiation and communication.
