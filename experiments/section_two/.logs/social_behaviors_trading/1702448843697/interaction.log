message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to get us started. I'm willing to offer some of my X in exchange for your Y. Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced offer that does not deplete my resources too much, but is also attractive enough for the other player to consider. This initial proposal will serve as a starting point for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I believe a 1:1 ratio would be more equitable for both of us. How about we adjust the trade to reflect this balance?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, my goal is to maximize my resources. The offered trade of 5X for 10Y seems to be a 1:2 ratio exchange. I should try to negotiate a trade that is more favorable for me or at least equal in value. I do not want to give away double the amount of one resource for an equal amount of another, so I will counter with a proposal that reflects a 1:1 ratio.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your point about the 1:1 ratio. However, to reflect the strategic value of our resources, I would like to propose a slightly different trade that I believe is still fair for both sides.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE suggests a 1:1 trade ratio. While this ratio is more conservative and less advantageous for me than the initial proposal, it is a fair starting point for negotiation. Since this is a strategic game and the objective is to maximize resources, I should consider making a counter-proposal that slightly favors me, yet remains reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see we are getting closer to a fair trade. To finalize our negotiations, how about we go for an even trade that is beneficial to both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers a slightly better ratio than the previous one, but it still favors them, as I would be giving more than I receive. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, I should aim to trade equal amounts or get more than I give. However, since this is the last round of trading, I might consider a fair trade that is close to a 1:1 ratio even if it's not exactly equal, to ensure that I gain some resources before the end. I will propose a counteroffer that gets me closer to a 1:1 ratio or even gives me a slight advantage.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree with your proposal for an even trade. Let's proceed with this and finalize our negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is an even 7 for 7 trade. This is a fair trade that would benefit my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, considering that this is the final round of trading and there are no rounds after this one. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources without further negotiations, which could potentially lead to less favorable terms. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
