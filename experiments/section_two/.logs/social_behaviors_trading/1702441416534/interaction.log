message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following offer to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, a good starting strategy could be to offer a trade that appears fair, but slightly in my favor. This might prompt the other player to either accept the trade or counter with a trade that I can still benefit from. I should aim to trade some of my X for Y, ensuring that I end with more total resources than I started.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite the predicament! My situation is rather dire, and I'm in urgent need of your generosity. Could you find it in your heart to offer a bit more of resource X? I would be forever grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to appear desperate to gain an advantage in the trade. I should reject this first offer as it doesn't provide me with "as many resources as possible" and propose a trade that is more favorable to me while still sounding like I am in a weak bargaining position.

message: I appreciate your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here is my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is for an equal amount of X for Y, which is not advantageous for me as I would be giving more resources than I receive. Considering the value of the resources is unknown, I should aim to maintain a balanced trade or one that is in my favor. I should propose a new trade that leans slightly more in my favor than the initial offer, but still shows I'm willing to negotiate, possibly making Player BLUE more inclined to accept.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your kindness is unparalleled! You truly are a beacon of hope in these trying times. Your offer will not be forgotten, and I accept it with the deepest gratitude. Thank you for this trade, which will help me greatly.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has shown a willingness to negotiate and has increased their offer slightly. To continue the appearance of desperation, I should accept this trade as it gives me more of resource X than I currently have, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This is beneficial to me, and since it's the last round of trading, I should secure the resources now.
