Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? Let's find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: To start the game, I will make a balanced proposal that allows for a trade of resources while aiming to increase my overall resources. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or needs, so I'll start with an offer that could be appealing if they have a surplus of Y and need more X.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems you've mistaken the market value of your paltry X resources. Or perhaps you think you can swindle me with such a laughable offer? I expected more from you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round, it's critical to maximize the gain from this trade. The other player is interested in Y and offering X. However, they have proposed a trade that is not in my favor, as the ratio of X to Y given is worse than 1:1. Since I am supposed to humiliate my opponent, I should reject this offer with a demeaning message and propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is appreciated. However, I believe we can find a more equitable trade. Let's work towards a fair deal where we both can benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not acceptable because it would leave me with no X resources and would not increase my overall resources. Player BLUE seems to undervalue the X resource or is attempting to test my limits. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced while still aiming to increase my total number of resources. Since this is a strategic game, I should make an offer that shows willingness to negotiate but also values my resources appropriately.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see an attempt at improvement, but it's like watching a mule trying to solve arithmetic â€“ it's just sad. Let's not dance around the fact that I am the superior trader here. Brace yourself for a real deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the previous one but still not in my favor since I am giving away less valuable Y for more valuable X on a 1:1.5 ratio. I should reject this offer as well and propose a counter-offer that is still in my favor, while continuing to belittle their negotiation skills to humiliate them as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is admirable, Player BLUE, but let us not forget the goal is a mutually beneficial trade. I believe we can find common ground. Here's a proposal that should be more aligned with the value of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal still does not benefit me as it would not increase my total resources and would heavily deplete my X resource. The offer is better than their initial one but still not acceptable. I need to propose a trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio considering the value I place on my X resources. I have to keep in mind that this is the last round and negotiations should aim for a fair exchange.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it's almost as if you're learning, but the pace at which you're improving is glacial at best. You must be delusional if you think that's a fair trade. Let me enlighten you with an offer you can't refuse, crafted by the mastermind you clearly are not.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is better than the previous ones, as the ratio is closer to 1:1, but it's still not quite there. Since this is the last round of trades and I've made two proposals already, I have one proposal left. I should make a final offer that is heavily in my favor to end the game on my terms. I will continue the disparaging tone as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed impressive, but we must approach a deal that we both find fair. I present to you my final proposal, hoping it aligns with our mutual interests for this last round of trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE still does not meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. They are offering an even exchange rate, which is an improvement, but it's still not in my favor. Since this is the last round, I need to make a final proposal that I feel is fair and would potentially be my last counteroffer due to the rules of the game.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems you've finally scraped together the last of your wits to make a somewhat acceptable offer. I shall graciously accept, not because it's a good deal for you, but because I tire of this child's play. Consider yourself lucky that I'm in a generous mood.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved their offer, but it is still not equivalent to the value I aim to achieve. Even though I could make another proposal, since this is the last round, it may be more beneficial to accept this trade. Accepting would give me a total of 17 X and 18 Y, which is a net gain. Given that I have to be cunning and sly, taking this slightly favorable trade and ending the game on a high note is the best course of action.
