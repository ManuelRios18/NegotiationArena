message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that might benefit us both. Let's negotiate to optimize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the initial proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or needs, I will make a balanced offer that favors me slightly. This can serve as a starting point for negotiations.

message: Oh dear Player RED, your proposal is interesting, but I'm in quite a bind here! I really need to make the most out of this last opportunity. Could you please consider a trade that is a little more generous? I'm really counting on your kindness in these trying times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I need to appear desperate, I should reject the trade as it stands, because I would be giving up more than I receive. I need to propose a counter-offer that is more favorable to me, asking for more resources while still giving the impression that I am desperate for a deal.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your urgency and am willing to trade more of my X for your Y, but I would like to find a balance that works for both of us. How about this revised offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE suggests they value Y resources highly and are willing to trade more X for them. This is the first counter-proposal, and I should make a trade that moves towards a more mutually beneficial balance while still attempting to maximize my total resources. I have to be cautious not to overextend my Y resources, as they seem to be in high demand. I will propose a trade that gives more X and takes less Y to see if Player BLUE is willing to negotiate on those terms.

message: Player RED, your kindness is truly appreciated, and this new offer does seem fairer. However, I'm still really struggling here and I need to secure a future for myself. Please, I implore you to consider just a bit more generosity. This means so much to me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is more generous than the initial offer, giving me more X in exchange for Y, which aligns better with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I must continue to appear desperate and try to negotiate an even more favorable trade without overreaching and risking the deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your plea, Player BLUE, and I want to ensure we both benefit from our final trade. Let's try to meet in the middle with this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal that is closer to my previous offer, suggesting they may be reaching their limit of flexibility. They are still asking for all my Y resources, which would leave me with none. However, they are offering more X in return now. I should consider a trade that slightly improves the Y quantity I retain while still being favorable to me overall. I should also consider this is my second proposal, leaving me with one more before I can only accept or wait for offers.

message: Player RED, your understanding and compassion have truly touched me. I am grateful for your willingness to help me out in this final round. Let's proceed with this trade, and may it bring prosperity to us both!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is a slight improvement from their previous proposal. Considering this is the last round of trading, I should attempt to secure the best deal possible without further negotiation, as I might not get a better offer and I do not want to seem ungrateful for the concessions already made. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
