message: Hello Player BLUE, let's begin with a fair trade. I propose giving you some of my X in exchange for some of your Y. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced trade proposal that could be beneficial for both sides. This proposal will serve as a starting point for negotiations and allow me to gauge the other player's priorities and resource availability.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, thank you for the offer. However, I believe a slightly better trade for me would be more appropriate considering this is our final round. I would be willing to trade less of my Y for your X to ensure a net gain in resources. How does this sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and there's no knowledge of the other player's resources, it's crucial to make a trade that is clearly beneficial based on the information given. Trading equal amounts does not necessarily meet my goals of acquiring as many resources as possible, but it's unknown if Player RED has a similar amount of Y as I have X. A counter-proposal skewed slightly in my favor could be ideal to open negotiations, considering I might not want to risk a flat rejection.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. Considering it's our last round, let's make the most of it. I'm willing to adjust the trade to better reflect a one-for-one exchange while ensuring we both benefit. How about I give you slightly less X for your Y?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a counter-offer that indicates they value their Y resources highly. Since this is the final round, it's important to negotiate a deal that maximizes my total resources. However, I want to propose a counter-offer that still gives me a net gain of resources. I will attempt to make a trade that is closer to a one-for-one exchange to keep the trade appealing to Player BLUE while ensuring I come out ahead in total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the trade, Player RED. I'm inclined to agree with the one-for-one exchange philosophy. However, I would like to propose a slightly more favorable trade for me, giving you a good amount of Y in return for a bit more of your X. Shall we try the following?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has suggested a new trade that is again offering a one-for-one exchange, but with reduced quantities. While this is a fair offer, I should aim to maximize my net gain of resources. Since Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate, it may be possible to push for a slightly better deal for myself, while still keeping the trade attractive for Player RED. I will propose a trade that still benefits Player RED but also ensures I receive more X in return for my Y, which I have in greater quantity. This will be my second proposal out of a maximum of three, so it's important to make it count.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see your point, but I would like to ensure that we both end this final round with a gain. How about we adjust the numbers slightly in my favor this time? I propose the following trade, which I believe is fair and mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade that would give me a net loss in the total number of resources, as I would be giving up 10 X for only 7 Y. Given my goal is to maximize resources, this trade would not be beneficial for me. I should counter with a trade that maintains a net gain of resources while being attractive to Player BLUE. I have two more proposals I can make, so I need to be strategic in my approach.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I believe we're close to a mutually advantageous agreement. For our final trade, I propose the following, which I think is a fair compromise and ensures that we both walk away with a beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a counter-proposal that gives us an equal exchange again, but with decreased quantities. Since this is the last round, it is crucial to maximize the net gain. The current offer does not provide a significant advantage. However, it's important to consider that pushing too hard may result in no trade at all, which would not be beneficial either. I will make one final proposal that slightly favors me, but still presents a reasonable trade for Player RED. This will be my third and last proposal, so it should be carefully balanced to encourage acceptance.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we are indeed very close to finalizing a deal. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's settle on a trade that ensures a net gain for both of us. I propose an equal exchange to conclude our trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE still results in a net loss for me, giving up 9 X for 7 Y. However, since this is the final trade and I want to end with a net gain, I need to propose a counter-offer that is more favorable to me. I must aim for an equal or greater amount of Y in exchange for my X to ensure a net increase in total resources. This will be my final proposal before deciding whether to accept their next offer or not.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I agree that an equal exchange is a fair way to conclude our trading. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed another equal exchange. Accepting this trade would not maximize my net gain as I could potentially receive more X in exchange for my Y based on previous negotiations. However, since this is my final response and I've already made three proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. Rejecting the offer risks ending with no trade at all, which would not be in line with my goal. Accepting this trade guarantees an increase in resource X, which I have less of, while maintaining a significant amount of resource Y. Considering the constraints, accepting this final trade seems to be the most reasonable action to ensure a net gain.
