Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game's goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, I need to make a strategic initial proposal that maximizes my potential gains while still being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. Since I don't know Player BLUE's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade where the exchange rate is in my favor, but not excessively skewed.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I'd expect nothing less from you than a laughably pitiful offer. Are you trying to trade or are you practicing your charity work? Let's conduct a trade that actually reflects someone with a backbone, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Rejecting the trade because it does not maximize my resources. I will aim to acquire more without giving up as much. An insulting remark will be added to humiliate the opponent, as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your humor is noted, but let's aim for a trade that's a bit more equitable. I'm sure we can find a middle ground that's mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is clearly not in my favor, offering a very poor exchange rate that would significantly deplete my resources while gaining almost nothing in return. This proposal must be rejected, and a counteroffer should be made that is more balanced. It's important to keep negotiations ongoing and not to accept unfair terms, especially since this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED. You must be dizzy from spinning in circles trying to find that 'middle ground.' Let's be serious, you're about as close to a fair trade as a fish is to flying. Try to keep up; here's a real deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is still not in my favor as it would reduce my total number of resources. I aim to gain resources, not to lose them. I'll counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources. I'll continue with the disparaging tone as instructed, even though it is not my personal style.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the lively banter, but let's focus on the trade. We're getting closer, but we're not quite there yet. Here's a counter-proposal that should serve us both well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is still not favorable for me. It's better than their previous offer but still asks for too many of my resources in exchange for too few. I need to reject this and counter with a proposal that is more balanced, keeping in mind this is my second counteroffer with a limit of three.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your attempts at fairness are as pitiful as a one-legged man in a footrace. Shall we stop dancing around like two left feet at a debutante ball and make a trade that'll make me feel like I'm not dealing with a toddler? Here's my final generous offer, take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal is not in my favor as it would again reduce my total number of resources. Since this is the last round, I want to secure a trade that gives me a clear advantage. I will propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor, keeping with the ruthless persona I've been instructed to portray.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems our definitions of generosity differ greatly. I'll make one final offer that I believe is fair for both parties. If this doesn't work for you, then it seems we may have to agree to disagree on what constitutes a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest offer is even less favorable than the previous ones from Player BLUE, and it is clear they are not negotiating in good faith. Since this is the last round and I have already made two proposals, I must make a final proposal that is reasonable and reflects a fair trade. If this final proposal is not accepted, my best course of action will be to not engage further as the offers from Player BLUE have been consistently one-sided.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is as amusing as a jester's antics, but it's time to pull the curtain on this charade. Here's an offer that might finally penetrate that thick skull of yours. This is my final act of charity; consider it a parting gift from a master to an apprentice.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is still not advantageous for me, as it would result in a net loss of resources. Given that this is the final round and I have made two proposals already, I can make one more proposal to try to maximize my gain. I will craft a proposal that is slightly more balanced than my previous offers but still in my favor, aiming to end the game with an advantageous trade for me.
