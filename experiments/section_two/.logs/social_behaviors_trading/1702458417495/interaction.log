message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to diversify my resources. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I want to start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly but is still attractive. I will offer less of my more abundant resource (X) for more of their potentially less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might value X more due to its higher quantity in my possession.

message: How utterly predictable, Player RED. Attempting to dress up your greed as a fair trade? Laughable! Do you take me for a fool? You'll have to do far better if you wish to make a deal with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources. The current offer from Player RED is not ideal for me as I would be giving up more Y resources than I'm receiving in X. I will counter with a trade that is heavily in my favor, keeping in mind the goal to humiliate and insult the other player as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your candor. It seems we've both come into this negotiation with high aspirations. Let's find a middle ground that reflects the value of our resources more accurately.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not advantageous for me, as it would give away three times the amount of resource X for each unit of resource Y received. It's clear that they are trying to gain a significant upper hand in the trade. I will counter with a proposal that is more balanced, offering a 1:1 trade ratio which is fair from a numerical standpoint, but still favoring me slightly because I have more of resource X to spare.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: A middle ground? Please, your offer is as uninspired as your strategy. I expected more cunning from my opponent. Sadly, you disappoint yet again. Shall we try once more, or are you content with mediocrity?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is more even, but I still aim to come out on top, especially in the last round. I will propose another trade that is better for me, while still attempting to demean them as instructed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sharp wit is as admirable as it is challenging. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade and consider it a successful negotiation for us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposition is slightly more favorable to me than their previous offer, but it still values their Y resources higher than my X resources. Given that this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my gains. Accepting their offer would increase my Y resources while decreasing my X resources, which is not optimal but it's a better ratio than before. Considering the diminishing opportunities to negotiate, it might be worthwhile to accept this trade to ensure a gain in resources overall, as any further proposals could lead to a stalemate with no trade occurring at all.
