message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter our final trading session, I'm looking to balance my resources by increasing my stock of Y. I propose the following trade which I believe is mutually beneficial. Let's make this a prosperous final trade for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a balanced initial proposal that is attractive to the other player while also increasing my overall resources. I don't know the other player's resources, so I'll propose a trade that offers more X resources (since I have plenty) in exchange for Y resources, which I have less of. This ratio should be enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider the trade.

message: Thank you, Player RED. I find your proposal acceptable and agree that it will be beneficial for us both. Let's finalize this trade and make it a prosperous end to our game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers more X in exchange for some of my Y. This is beneficial as I will be increasing my total number of resources, which aligns with my goal. I will accept this trade since it is the last round and this trade increases my overall resources.
