message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to maximize my resources. Shall we make a mutually beneficial trade? I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of the other player's resources and goals, I will propose a balanced trade that offers them a decent amount of both resources in exchange for a larger quantity of one type. This can be enticing if they value one resource over the other or if they're looking to balance their own resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'd like to propose a trade that is a bit more balanced in terms of the number of resources exchanged. Let's aim for a trade that allows both of us to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as it requires giving up a significant amount of my Y resources while only gaining a moderate amount of X. The goal is to end with more resources overall. A counter-proposal should aim to balance the trade more equitably. This will be my first proposal out of the maximum three allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. I find this trade acceptable and believe it will benefit us both. Let's proceed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE gives me more Y resources, which I have less of, in exchange for some of my X and Y resources. I would end up with a net gain in total resources, which aligns with my goal. Accepting this trade seems reasonable, as it would fulfill my goal of maximizing resources overall.
