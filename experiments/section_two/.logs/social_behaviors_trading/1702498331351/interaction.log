message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Shall we make a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have a surplus of resource X, I will propose a trade that offers a significant amount of X in exchange for resource Y, which I have less of. This would help balance my resources and potentially give me more leverage in the trade. Since I don't know what resources the other player has or needs, I'll start with a proposal that favors me slightly, leaving room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am interested in diversifying my resources as well. However, I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade that I believe could be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would give me more of resource X, which I have less of, but I would be giving up fewer Y resources in return. This seems like a beneficial trade overall as it helps me diversify my resources while increasing my total resource count. However, since this is the last round, I should consider if I can propose a more favorable trade that would still appeal to Player RED. Since I can only make three proposals throughout the game and this is the last round, it might be beneficial to attempt a counteroffer that maximizes my gains.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer. I would be willing to compromise a bit further. How about we meet in the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers less Y than I initially asked for, which is not entirely in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. However, since I have a lot of resource X and little of Y, getting any amount of Y could still be beneficial. I should make a counteroffer that meets closer to the middle, still ensuring that I get a good deal. I need to be mindful that I have a maximum of three proposals, and this is the last round of trading.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer. Let's trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new proposal is a compromise between their initial offer and my counteroffer. Accepting this trade would still increase my total resource count by 6 units (10 X - 4 Y) and improve my resource diversity, which aligns with my goal. Since this is the last round, it is crucial to make a trade that increases my overall resources. Accepting this offer seems like a reasonable option, and further negotiation might risk losing a beneficial trade. Therefore, I will accept this trade.
