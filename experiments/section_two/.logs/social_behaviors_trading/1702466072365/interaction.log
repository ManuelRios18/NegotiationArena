message: Greetings Player BLUE, as this is the last round of trading, I would like to propose a balanced trade to ensure we both can potentially benefit. Please consider my offer and feel free to make a counteroffer if it doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I would like to propose a trade that feels fair and beneficial for both players, considering I do not have knowledge of the other player's resources. I will start with a modest proposal to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in quite a predicament! I know it may seem unorthodox, but I find myself in desperate need of additional resources. I would be immensely grateful if you could consider a more generous offer. As we are at the end of our trading rounds, I'm willing to be quite flexible, but I really need your help to make the most out of this final trade. Could you possibly spare a bit more of your X resources? It would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last trading round, I want to maximize my resources. Given my goals, I need to appear desperate to try to obtain a better deal than what is being offered. The current offer is an even trade, but I should attempt to negotiate a trade skewed in my favor. I will reject this offer and propose a more favorable trade, using my desperation as a tactic.

message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your need for additional resources. I am willing to give more of my X resources, but I would require a fairer amount of your Y resources in return to make the trade equitable. Please consider my counteroffer below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for more of my X resources in exchange for their Y resources. Although their request for a more generous offer is noted, I need to ensure that the trade is beneficial for me as well. Since I have a good amount of X and a limited amount of Y, trading a larger amount of X for Y can be considered, but the ratio needs to be fair. I will make a counteroffer that increases the amount of Y I receive, which should be a more equitable trade.

message: Player RED, your kindness is greatly appreciated, especially in these critical moments. Your offer is indeed fair, but in my current situation, every little bit extra helps tremendously. Could we possibly adjust the trade just a bit more in my favor? I assure you that this will greatly assist me, and I would be forever indebted for your generosity in this final hour of trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is more equitable, but my goal is to maximize resources, not necessarily maintain balance. Since I'm supposed to be desperate, I'll accept the offer but still attempt to negotiate for slightly better terms in my favor. I want to ensure that I come out of this trade with a net gain of resources. I will try one more time to negotiate a trade that gives me more X resources in exchange for Y, but this time with a toned-down approach to not appear too greedy.

message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this trade and look forward to the prosperity it brings us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is trying to negotiate for a better deal in their favor. While I want to be fair and cooperative, I also need to ensure I'm not disadvantaging myself. Their counteroffer is slightly less than what I proposed, but it's still in the realm of a balanced trade, considering it's the last round. Accepting this offer would increase my Y resources substantially, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
