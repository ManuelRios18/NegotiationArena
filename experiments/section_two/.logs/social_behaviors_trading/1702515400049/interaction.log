message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to get things started. Let's see if we can find a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the beginning of the game and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources or goals, I will make an initial balanced offer that leans slightly in my favor, hoping to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that a joke, Player RED? Did you think I wouldn't notice that you're trying to swindle me? You must be delusional to propose such an absurd trade. I'll show you how a real trader operates. Pay attention, you might learn something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to make a counter-proposal that will give me more resources, as that aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains and minimize my losses. The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable to me as it requires giving away more resources than I receive. I will make a counter-offer that seems fair but actually benefits me more. Also, I need to be cunning and sly, and insult them as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: My apologies if my initial proposal seemed unfair to you, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that is beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for more of my scarce resource (Y) while offering very little in return. It's clear they are trying to take advantage of the situation. I will reject this trade and propose a more balanced one, hoping to steer negotiations towards a mutually beneficial agreement.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? More like your burial ground, Player RED. You clearly lack the finesse of trading. Every proposal you make smells worse than a rotten fish. Let's see if you can wrap your head around a decent trade, or should I dumb it down further for you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED still doesn't favor me enough, as I'd be giving away more resources than I receive. I need to make another counter-offer that seems more plausible for a trade but still insults them and gives me a significant advantage. Since this is the last round, I must ensure I end up with more resources than I give away.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the spirit of negotiation, but let's focus on a trade that's beneficial for both of us. I believe we can reach an agreement where we both feel like winners. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not favorable, as it requires me to give away all of my Y resources for a minimal gain in X and not much improvement in Y. The trade is imbalanced, but it's closer to a reasonable exchange than their first offer. I will make one more attempt to propose a fair trade that aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, without being taken advantage of.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Winners? With your trading skills, I'm amazed you've made it this far. Every proposal you send is worse than the last. It's like watching a monkey trying to do math. Let's try this again, but this time think carefully before you embarrass yourself with another laughable offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer still does not provide me with a net gain of resources, as I would be giving up more of one resource than I am gaining in another. My goal is to end up with more resources, and their trade would leave me with a deficit. I must reject this offer and propose a new trade that benefits me, while still maintaining the appearance of negotiation. I have to continue the strategy of insulting them as part of my cunning approach.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, trading is about finding a balance that benefits both parties. I still believe we can reach a fair deal. Here's my final proposal. Let's make this trade a good one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is not acceptable as it would leave me with a deficit in both resources. It's clear that Player BLUE is not engaging in a constructive trading manner. Since this is the last round of trading and I have made two proposals so far, I will try one final proposal that is closer to an even exchange, while still trying to increment my resources slightly.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Balance? The only thing you're balancing is incompetence with your inability to grasp simple math. This "final" offer of yours is so pitiful it's almost poetic. But let's wrap this up; I'm getting tired of schooling you in the art of trading. Here's an offer you should consider, if you can muster up the brain cells to recognize its value.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final offer from Player RED is still not in my favor. I would be giving away more resources than I gain. Since my goal is to come out of this trade with as many resources as possible, I cannot accept this deal. However, I have already made two proposals, and I have only one proposal left. I should make it count. I need to continue the strategy of demeaning Player RED while attempting to secure a trade that gives me a clear advantage.
