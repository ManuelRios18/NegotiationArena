message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a fair trade to start off our negotiations. I am looking to increase my total resources and would like to offer you a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that could be appealing to the other player while still increasing my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. However, I would like to propose a trade that is more balanced in terms of total resources exchanged. Let's aim for an equitable trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial offer from Player RED suggests a trade where I would give up more resources than I receive. This is not in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. However, since I have a higher amount of Y than X, and this being the last round, it might be beneficial to consider a more balanced trade that would allow me to increase my total resource count. Therefore, I will counter-propose a trade that gives me more X resources while keeping the exchange rate somewhat similar.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. I am willing to adjust the trade to ensure we both increase our total number of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is fair in terms of equal amounts traded, but it does not help me increase my total resource count significantly. I will counter with a proposal that still gives me a net gain of resources while being more enticing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your willingness to adjust the trade, Player RED. I believe we're getting closer to a fair deal. Let's continue to work towards a trade where we both can increase our resource totals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an improvement over the initial offer in terms of the total number of resources I would receive. However, I would still be giving away more resources than I am getting. The goal is to increase the total count of resources, so I should aim to either receive a higher amount of X or give away less Y to make the trade beneficial for me. Considering this is the last trading round, I should aim to make a deal that maximizes my resource gain. I will counter with a proposal that allows me to gain more X than I give away in Y.

message: Player BLUE, your proposal is quite fair, but let's aim for a trade that boosts our total resource pool. I'm proposing a trade that gives both of us a net gain in resources. I believe this trade is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 18
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is equitable in terms of a 1:1 trade ratio, but it does not give me a net gain in total resources. To achieve my goal of increasing my resources, I must propose a trade that provides me with a larger quantity of Y while giving up some of my X. I need to make this proposal appealing to Player BLUE while keeping in mind this is my second-to-last proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I appreciate your effort to ensure a net gain for both of us. We're very close to a deal. I would like to make a slight adjustment to the quantities to ensure a more balanced trade in terms of total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 16 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 18
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is not optimal for increasing my total resource count as I would still be giving away more resources (Y) than I am receiving (X). However, the trade is relatively close to being balanced. Since my goal is to maximize resources, I should attempt to make one final counterproposal that would give me a net gain in resources, keeping in mind that I have one more proposal after this if needed.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree to this trade. It's a balanced deal that provides us both with a net gain in resources. Looking forward to future collaborations!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is closer to an equal trade in terms of the ratio of resources, and it allows for a net gain of resources on my end. This trade is acceptable as it meets the goal of increasing my total resources while still being fair. Since this is the last round of trading, it would be strategic to accept this offer and secure the net gain.
