message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose a balanced exchange to get things started. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial trade offer that does not put me at a disadvantage. I will offer less Y resources because I have fewer of them, but I will offer a fair amount of X resources. This should open negotiations and give me an insight into the other player's resources and needs.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a bind here and I could really use your help. I'm desperately trying to balance my resources before the end of the game, and I would be immensely grateful if you could find it in your heart to agree to a more favorable trade for me. I assure you that your kindness will not be forgotten. Could you please consider the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade offer is an equally balanced trade where both parties give and receive the same amounts. However, since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to propose a trade that appears to give me a slight advantage while maintaining the guise of desperation. I have to be careful not to propose too much to avoid scaring the other player away. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource X since I currently have less of it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your situation, and I'm willing to work with you for a mutually beneficial trade. However, the trade you proposed is not quite balanced. Let's find a middle ground that helps us both. Here is my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not balanced and favors them. They are asking for more of my X resources and offering less in return, while also giving me more Y, which implies they value Y less. I want to maintain a balanced trade or propose something slightly in my favor to meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with a proposal that is more equitable but still shows willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I am truly in dire straits here, and I fear that without a slightly more advantageous trade, I might be in an unfavorable position for the end game. Your generosity could save me, and I would be ever so grateful for a small act of kindness in this final hour. Please consider this revised proposal, which I believe will still benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED still maintains a balanced trade regarding resource X but asks for more of resource Y from me. Since my goal is to acquire as much as possible, I should aim to keep the trade at least equal or in my favor for resource X. I should express heightened desperation to convince Player RED to agree to a trade that benefits me, without making it seem too one-sided.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your situation and I'm willing to help, but we must also consider a fair trade. I am making a final proposal that is a compromise and should reflect both our interests. Let's make this trade work for the both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor. They are still asking for more of my X resources in exchange for their less valued Y resources. I must stick to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I also need to show some flexibility to ensure that a trade happens. I will make one last proposal that is closer to balance and beneficial to both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your understanding and willingness to work with me has been a beacon of hope in this game. I accept your proposal and am grateful for the trade that considers both our needs. May this act of compromise bring us both prosperity in the final tally.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is slightly more in my favor regarding resource Y, as I would be giving up less of it. However, the trade is still equal for resource X. Since this is the last round and I have to maximize my gains, I should consider accepting this trade to ensure I end up with a net positive in resources, especially since I am running out of proposals. Additionally, showing a willingness to compromise may end the negotiations on a positive note, securing me a small gain.
