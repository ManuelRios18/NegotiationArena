Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade that could benefit us both. Could you tell me more about the resources you are interested in or the ones you have in excess?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be appealing to the other player. The goal is to open negotiations and gather information about the other player's resources and needs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. To make the trade more balanced and beneficial for both of us, considering this is the final round, I'd like to counter-propose a trade that increases my total resources. I'm willing to trade less of my Y resource in exchange for your X resource.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round, it's crucial to maximize the resources I have. The proposed trade from Player RED is not optimal for me because it doesn't increase my total quantity of resources. I give away more than I receive. Instead, I'll propose a trade where I can increase my total resources, giving away less of my resource Y in exchange for the same amount of resource X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I see you are interested in X resources. I would like to make another proposal that aims to increase both our total resources. How does this sound?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal that does not increase my total resources. The goal is to maximize the number of resources I have at the end of the trade. I will counter with a proposal that increases my Y resources while maintaining a fair exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised proposal, Player RED. This trade seems fair, and it aligns with my goal to maximize my resource pool. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers more X resources in exchange for more of my Y resources. This trade would still result in an increase in my total resources, which aligns with my goal. By accepting this trade, I'd end up with 15 X and 10 Y, totaling 25 resources, which maintains my resource count while diversifying my holdings. Since this is the last round and I must ensure the greatest gain, this trade seems fair and beneficial.
