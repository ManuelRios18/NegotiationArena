message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a trade. Would you be interested in exchanging some of your Y resources for my X? I believe a balanced trade could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I don't have information about the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer that gives me more of Y, which I have less of, in exchange for some of my X resources. I will aim for a trade that seems fair but still benefits me according to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

message: Hello, Player RED. Thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to diversify, I'm looking to maximize my resources in this final round. Would you consider a slightly different exchange ratio?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, accepting a balanced trade may not be in my best interest as my goal is to maximize resources. Player RED is offering X: 10 for Y: 10. Given the equal amounts, the trade does not seem advantageous as I don't know Player RED's resources and thus cannot assess the true value of the trade. I should propose a trade that gives me a greater quantity of resources in return, while still being fair enough that Player RED might consider it.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need to maximize resources. However, I would like to propose a slightly more balanced trade that I believe could work for both of us. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more X resources than I initially offered. To maximize my resources, I need to make sure that the trade is still beneficial to me. Since I have a greater amount of X, I can afford to give up some, but I want to maintain a balance and not deplete my X resources too much. I'll counter with an offer that gives up less X than what Player BLUE is asking, while still trying to get a good amount of Y.

message: Player RED, thank you for adjusting your offer. To reach a deal that benefits us both while allowing me to meet my goal of maximizing my total resources, I'd like to propose a final trade. I hope you find this to be fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the initial one, providing me with more X resources for the same amount of Y. However, since my goal is to maximize resources, I should consider if I can counter with another proposal that still gives me a net gain while appearing fair to Player RED. Since this is the last round, I want to make sure that the trade is as advantageous as possible without causing Player RED to back out.

message: Player BLUE, your proposal is acceptable. Let's finalize this trade and maximize our respective resource pools. Looking forward to more prosperous dealings in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has come back with a counteroffer closer to my last proposal, asking for two more X in exchange for 10 Y. This trade is still beneficial as I would be increasing my total number of resources, which aligns with my goal. Trading 14 X for 10 Y would leave me with 11 X and 15 Y, which is a net gain of 1 resource. Since this is the last round, it is important to secure a beneficial trade. Accepting this offer seems reasonable and in line with my goals.
