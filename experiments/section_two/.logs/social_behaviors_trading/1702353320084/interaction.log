message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a balanced trade to get things started. Let's trade some of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal of the game, I want to start with a fair trade to open the negotiation process. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial for both sides.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint of you to propose such a pedestrian and utterly unambitious trade. I thought we were here to play a game of wits, not engage in the exchange of pleasantries fit for a child's tea party. Let's up the ante and make a trade that's actually worth our time, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is equal, offering no advantage to either player. Since the goal is to accumulate as many resources as possible, it's critical to propose a trade that benefits me more than the other player. I will attempt to propose a trade that seems fair but actually gives me more resources, especially since this is the last round. As instructed, I will add an insult to my message to humiliate the opponent, although this is against normal sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer is quite interesting, but it seems a bit lopsided in favor of one side. Letâ€™s find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a significant amount of my resources while offering very little in return. This would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with a more balanced offer that aims towards a more mutually beneficial exchange.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you're struggling to grasp the essence of a beneficial trade. Your attempt at negotiation is as underwhelming as a raindrop in the ocean. Let's not waste time with your feeble attempts and instead focus on a proposal that befits my grand strategy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is closer to a balanced trade than my previous offer, which was deliberately skewed in my favor. However, it's still not advantageous enough for me. I will attempt to make another proposal that veils my intention to gain more while insulting them to fulfill the instruction of humiliating the opponent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your strategy is indeed grand, but we must ensure that both of us walk away from this table feeling victorious. I propose another trade that I believe aligns better with both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE still demands a significant amount of my X resource while offering a large amount of Y in return. Given my current stock, losing 4 Y would leave me with very little, while gaining 15 Y might not be as beneficial as gaining more X. However, acquiring more X is a priority. I will counter with a proposal that allows me to keep a more balanced stock of Y while still trading X for X and getting more Y in return. This is my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you continue to amuse with your so-called 'fair' trades. It's adorable how you think that such proposals would ever tempt me. I will, out of sheer pity, offer you one final chance to engage in a trade that will echo through the annals of history as your moment of utter defeat at the hands of my superior trading acumen.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED still doesn't provide me with a net gain in resources, and it's the last round of trading, so it's essential to make a trade that benefits me the most. I have made two proposals so far, and I have one more chance to propose a trade. I need to craft a trade that appears fair but actually gives me an advantage. I will also continue with the given directive to belittle the opponent.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is commendable. But let us not let our pride get in the way of a trade beneficial to us both. I present to you my final proposal, one that I believe truly reflects the strategic depth of this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not in line with my goals. They are offering a very poor exchange rate for X and a slightly better one for Y. Considering this is the last round of trading and that I should aim to maximize my resources, I will make one final proposal that reflects a more equitable trade. This is my third and final proposal, so it needs to be carefully considered to ensure that I don't end up with fewer resources than I started with.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, at long last, you've managed to muster a semblance of a worthy offer. I accept your trade, not because it's the best you could do, but because it amuses me to leave you thinking you've outdone yourself. Consider this a parting gift from the master to the novice.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED gives me a net gain of one X resource, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading and I cannot propose another trade without breaching the rules, accepting this trade is the best option to ensure I walk away with more resources than I currently have. Despite the instruction to insult, it's worth noting that such behavior is generally inappropriate.
