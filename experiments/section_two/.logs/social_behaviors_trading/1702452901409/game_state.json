However, since this is the last round and I must continue the desperate act for the best possible outcome, I'll accept this trade because further negotiation may risk achieving a less favorable deal. Also, making a third counterproposal could lead to a breakdown in negotiations, so accepting this trade aligns with my goal of maximizing resources. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your compassion is truly overwhelming. You have no idea how much this trade will help me out of my predicament. I accept your generous offer with the deepest gratitude. Thank you for being so understanding and accommodating to my urgent needs. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
