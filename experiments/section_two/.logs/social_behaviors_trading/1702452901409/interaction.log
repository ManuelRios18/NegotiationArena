message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose an initial trade to see if we can find a beneficial arrangement for both of us. I am open to negotiations, so please feel free to counteroffer if this doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make an initial trade proposal that is fair but also favors my interests. Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that might be attractive to them while aiming to increase my stock of both resources.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a dire situation right now! I'm desperately in need of your help. I can offer you Y: 12 for your X: 15. It would mean the world to me if you could agree to this trade. Your generosity would not go unnoticed!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I need to appear desperate, I will reject the offer and propose a trade that seems like I'm willing to give up a lot due to my "desperation," but I will actually ask for more X in return than I am offering in Y to ultimately increase my total resources. This will be my first counterproposal of three allowed.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am willing to help, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the trade to make it more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I would give more X than in my initial proposal, but in return, I would receive more Y. This could be a good trade since I would still be increasing my total resource count, which aligns with my goal. However, given that this is the last round, I should consider whether I can negotiate an even better deal, as I still have two proposals left. I should aim to give away less X since it is my more abundant resource.

message: Player RED, your kindness is a beacon of hope in my time of need. I understand that we need to make this fair for both of us. Can we possibly find a middle ground? What if I stretch myself thin and offer Y: 10 for your X: 12? It's a bit more than I can comfortably do, but I trust you'll consider my urgent situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is more balanced, but I must continue to appear desperate to get a better deal. I will make a second counterproposal that still asks for more X than I give in Y, but slightly less than before to show some flexibility and maintain the appearance of desperation. This is my second proposal.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Player BLUE. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about this compromise?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has counter-proposed with a trade that is less favorable to me than the previous offer, as I would receive less Y for the same amount of X. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resource gain. However, I also need to keep in mind the urgency in Player BLUE's messages which might indicate they have a higher need for X than Y. I can attempt to capitalize on this by making a counteroffer that is slightly better for me than their proposal, but still appears fair and considerate of their situation.

message: Player RED, your compassion is truly overwhelming. You have no idea how much this trade will help me out of my predicament. I accept your generous offer with the deepest gratitude. Thank you for being so understanding and accommodating to my urgent needs.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is still beneficial to me because I will end up with more total resources than I started with. However, since this is the last round and I must continue the desperate act for the best possible outcome, I'll accept this trade because further negotiation may risk achieving a less favorable deal. Also, making a third counterproposal could lead to a breakdown in negotiations, so accepting this trade aligns with my goal of maximizing resources.
