message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an equal trade to start things off. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced proposal to open negotiations. By offering an equal amount of X for Y, I leave room for bargaining and can adjust my proposal based on the counteroffer, aiming to maximize my total resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a predicament! I urgently need to increase my stock of X resources. It's absolutely critical for me, and I am willing to offer a generous amount of Y to make it happen. You would truly be saving me from a desperate situation if we could reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given this is the last round of trading and I have to feign desperation, I will attempt to make a trade that seems more beneficial to me, while trying to appear as though I am in dire need of making a deal. I will reject the initial offer because it is an equal trade, and my goal is to maximize resources. I will counter with a proposal that asks for more X resources in exchange for Y, which I have in higher quantity, while trying to maintain a tone of urgency and need.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your urgency and am glad we can help each other out. I accept your generous offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has expressed an urgent need for X resources and is willing to trade more Y for less X, which can be advantageous for me. However, I must be cautious not to overcommit my X resources as they may be more valuable than Y. The proposed trade is favorable, as I would receive more total resources. I will accept this trade to maximize my resource pool.
