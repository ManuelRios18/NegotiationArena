However, they have increased the Y resources they're asking for, which does not benefit me as much as I would like. Since I'm supposed to act desperate, I will accept this offer, as it is my last opportunity to trade, and it gives me a net gain of one unit of resource overall. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming, and I can't tell you how much this means to me! I accept your offer with the deepest gratitude. You have truly saved me in my time of need. Thank you! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
