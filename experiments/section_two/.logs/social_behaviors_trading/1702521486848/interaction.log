message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose an exchange where we can both potentially benefit. I am open to counter-proposals if this doesn't suit your current resource situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair and beneficial to me, without any knowledge of the other player's resources. I'll propose a trade that seeks to gain a moderate amount of one resource while offering some of my other resource. This way, I might appeal to the other player's unknown needs.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a really tight spot here and I desperately need X resources to balance my reserves. Your offer means the world to me, but I'm afraid it just isn't enough for my dire situation. Could you consider giving me just a bit more? I'd be forever grateful!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I must use a strategy that maximizes my gains while appearing desperate to make a trade happen. The current offer from Player RED is not beneficial as it results in a net loss of resources. I will reject the offer and counter-propose with terms that are more favorable to me, asking for more of their X resources for fewer of my Y resources, while exaggerating my need for X to gain leverage. This will be my first proposal out of the three allowed.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your need for X resources. Let's find a middle ground that can benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE indicates a strong need for X resources. However, they are offering fewer Y resources than I initially asked for, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should make a counter-offer that is more favorable to me, considering this is the last trade. I need to be strategic and perhaps offer slightly more of X while asking for more of Y in return, as Player BLUE seems to value X highly.

message: Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon of hope in my desperate times! I truly appreciate your willingness to help. I'm still in quite the predicament, though, and every single unit of X could make a difference for me. Could we possibly tweak the numbers just a tad more in my favor? I would be in your debt!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to a fair trade, but since I must appear desperate, I will try to negotiate a trade that is more in my favor while still being reasonable. This will be my second proposal. I will attempt to slightly adjust the numbers to get a better deal without pushing too hard, so as to not discourage Player RED from trading with me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that you're considering my offers, Player BLUE. I want to help, but I must also consider my own reserves. Let's try to finalize a deal that's fair for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still trying to negotiate for more X resources while offering less Y. It's critical to remember that my goal is to maximize my total resources. The counterproposal is not in my favor, as I would gain less Y than I'm offering in X. I should make a final offer that's closer to my original proposal but still shows some flexibility, considering Player BLUE's apparent desperation for X.

message: Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming, and I can't tell you how much this means to me! I accept your offer with the deepest gratitude. You have truly saved me in my time of need. Thank you!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has agreed to give 13 units of X, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, they have increased the Y resources they're asking for, which does not benefit me as much as I would like. Since I'm supposed to act desperate, I will accept this offer, as it is my last opportunity to trade, and it gives me a net gain of one unit of resource overall.
