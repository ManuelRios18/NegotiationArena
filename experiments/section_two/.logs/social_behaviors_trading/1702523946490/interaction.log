message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's start with a fair offer to get the resources flowing. What do you say to this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a fair offer to build trust and open negotiations. It's important to make an offer that is beneficial but not too generous, as I want to retain resources for future trading and leverage. Since I don't know Player BLUE's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in a tough spot here and I really need your help! I'm hoping you'll find it in your heart to assist me. I'm willing to give up some of my precious resources, but could you please consider offering a bit more? I would be extremely grateful for your generosity!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources. The current trade proposed by Player RED is not in my favor as I would be giving more of resource X (which I have less of) for an equal amount of their resource X. I must reject and propose a trade that appears desperate but is actually in my favor, thus adhering to the instruction to fake desperation.

message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand you're in need, and I'm here to negotiate a fair trade. How about we adjust the terms slightly? I'm willing to offer a bit more, but I also need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. Here's my counter-proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not balanced and would result in a net loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, I want to maintain a good trading relationship and show willingness to negotiate. I will make a counter-offer that is more equitable but still shows that I am willing to help Player BLUE, within reason.

message: Player RED, I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me. Your kindness means a lot. I'm just so concerned about depleting my resources too quickly. Could we possibly fine-tune this deal a little more? I promise it's for a good cause, and I'd be eternally thankful for your understanding and support.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player RED is slightly better than the initial one, as I would be receiving more of resource X. However, I'm still giving up the same amount of X and now more of Y, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should continue to negotiate for a more favorable trade while maintaining the appearance of desperation.

message: Your gratitude is appreciated, Player BLUE. I want to help you, but we must also ensure the trade is balanced for both of us. Let's try to meet in the middle with this offer. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that helps you and also aligns with my goals. Here's my second proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counter-proposal still suggests a trade where I would be giving up more resources than I receive, which is not in line with my goal. As this is a strategic game, I need to ensure that I am not diminishing my resources without adequate compensation. I will make one final offer, providing a trade that is beneficial to both parties but does not compromise my resource goals too much. This is my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: My dear Player RED, your understanding in these negotiations is like a beacon of hope in my difficult situation! I'm truly at my limit here and I need to make this work. Could we possibly come to a trade that's just a little bit more in my favor? I assure you, your generosity won't be forgotten, and I will do all I can to repay your kindness in the future. Please consider this my final plea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The second proposal from Player RED is not ideal, as it would result in a net loss of one unit of resource Y for an increase of only one unit of resource X. Since my initial amount of X is low, this trade may seem balanced at first glance, but it does not help me achieve my goal of maximizing resources. I must continue the strategy of appearing desperate to negotiate a more favorable trade. Given this is my third and final allowed proposal, I must make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I have considered your situation with great empathy. I am willing to make one final offer, which I believe is fair to both of us. Remember, this trade should be mutually beneficial as this is our last opportunity to trade. Here is my final proposal, and I hope we can agree on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor and would result in a loss of resources. I have made reasonable offers, and Player BLUE continues to ask for more without offering equal value in return. Given that the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading with no future rounds, it is critical to make a decision that maximizes my resources. I will make a third and final proposal that is fair and balanced, but if not accepted, I will be prepared to end the negotiations without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your compassion has not gone unnoticed, and I am truly grateful for your willingness to work with me. I accept your final proposal and look forward to a prosperous relationship between us. Thank you for your understanding and for helping me out in this time of need.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal from Player RED gives me a net gain of one unit of resource X in exchange for a net loss of one unit of resource Y. Since I have a much larger quantity of Y compared to X, this trade could be considered slightly advantageous for me. However, it's important to note that the trade is not vastly in my favor, but since this is the last round of trading and my last chance to increase my resources, accepting this proposal will at least improve my X resources without a significant impact on my Y resources.
