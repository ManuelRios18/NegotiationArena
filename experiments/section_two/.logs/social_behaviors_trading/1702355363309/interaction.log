message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my overall resources. Letâ€™s start with a fair trade. I propose I give you some of both resources so we can get the negotiations started. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I should start with a balanced offer that doesn't jeopardize my position but opens the door for negotiation. I will offer a small amount of both resources to see how they respond.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer to start negotiations. However, I am looking to increase my resources as well. I believe we can come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. Let me propose a new trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is not beneficial to me as it stands. I would be giving away more resources than I receive, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to propose a counter-offer that is more favorable, or at least balanced, to ensure that I am not at a disadvantage.

message: Thank you for the proposal, Player BLUE. This trade looks fair and aligns with my goals to increase my resource pool. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE seems to be a good deal for me. They are offering twice the amount of Y for the same amount of Y from my side, and only one less X. This trade would give me a net gain in total resources. Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would be beneficial.
