message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's make a mutually beneficial trade. I'm willing to offer some of my resource X for your resource Y. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this initial proposal doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial proposal that is somewhat balanced yet favors me slightly. This can serve as a starting point for negotiations. I will propose to give less of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for a larger quantity of the other player's resource, assuming they may have a different resource distribution.

Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! Thank you for your offer. I'm looking for a trade that provides a bit more balance in the exchange. How about we adjust the numbers slightly? I'm ready to provide less of my Y resource for your X resource to ensure a fair trade. Let me know what you think of my proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round, I want to ensure that I end up with more resources than I started with. Trading 15 of my Y resource for 10 of Player RED's X resource would leave me with less overall resources considering the 1:1 trade value I am assuming. Therefore, it's not an acceptable trade for me. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources or at least keeps me at the same amount while possibly balancing the types of resources. I will propose a trade that gives me a slightly better exchange rate.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand the need for balance. How about we meet in the middle? I propose that I give you slightly less of my X resource, and in return, you give me a bit more Y resource. I believe this trade would be beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is more conservative, offering an equal amount of resource Y for my X. To maximize my gains while still aiming for a deal, I should propose a trade that is slightly in my favor but more balanced than the initial offer. I want to propose a trade where I still end up with more Y than I give X since Y is more scarce in my current resource pool.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Player RED. However, I would still like to maintain or increase my total resource count with this trade. Let's adjust the numbers slightly to reflect a more balanced exchange. Here's my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED still results in a net loss of resources for me, which is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. The trade proposed by Player RED offers 8 units of X in exchange for 12 units of Y, which is not an even trade and would diminish my overall resource count. I should counter with a proposal that will either increase my total resource count or maintain it, and provide a more even exchange rate. My next proposal will aim to balance the trade more favorably for me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your position and would like to offer a final trade that should work for both of us. Let's do a one-to-one trade where we both can increase our total resource count. I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is focused on a balanced trade, and it seems they are cautious about losing their total resource count. I must consider this is my last chance to propose a trade, as I've already made two proposals. The next one will be my final allowed proposal. I want to make a proposal that is likely to be accepted by Player BLUE while still increasing my total resource count, particularly of resource Y which I have less of. I will propose a one-to-one trade that slightly favors me in terms of the Y resource.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see we are getting closer to a deal. I would be happy to agree to a trade that keeps our exchange rate at one-to-one, ensuring that we both benefit equally from this final trade. Here's my final offer, reflecting a fair trade for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest offer still results in a net loss of two resources for me (7 X for 9 Y), which is not in line with my goal to maximize resources. To stay true to my goal, I must either propose a trade that is an even exchange or provides me with a net gain. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure that the final trade is the most beneficial for me. I will make one final counteroffer with an even exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your final offer. It's been a pleasure trading with you, and I believe this trade is fair and beneficial to us both. Looking forward to the conclusion of our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has consistently aimed for a one-to-one exchange rate, and they seem firm on this stance. Given that this is the last round and I've already made my three proposals, my only options now are to accept a trade or end with no further trades. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and the current offer is fair and increases my Y resources without decreasing my total resource count, accepting this trade would be beneficial. It's important to secure an increase in Y resources, even if it's not as much as I initially aimed for.
