message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to balance our resources. Shall we see if we can make a mutually beneficial deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I need to propose a trade that is beneficial but also enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider. I have a significant amount of resource X and a smaller amount of resource Y. I will propose a trade that offers a fair amount of my more abundant resource in exchange for Player BLUE's less abundant resource, assuming they might have a reverse ratio of X and Y.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a bind! I truly need more of resource X to reach my goals. It pains me to ask, but could you possibly consider giving a bit more X for my Y? I would be forever grateful for your kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have to appear desperate, I should counter with a proposal that seems fair but actually leans slightly in my favor. I want to suggest a trade where I give up fewer Y resources than they are offering in X, showing desperation but also attempting to maximize my gain.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X and am willing to negotiate. However, to maintain a fair trade, I would require a bit more of resource Y in return. Please consider my adjusted proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more of resource X, which I have in abundance. However, I must be cautious not to give away too much without gaining enough of resource Y in return. I have to consider that Player BLUE might be trying to capitalize on my resources without offering a fair exchange. Nonetheless, I want to maintain good relations and show willingness to negotiate. I'll propose a counteroffer that increases the amount of X slightly but also asks for a bit more Y from Player BLUE. This should help me move towards my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible while still appearing cooperative.

message: Player RED, your understanding touches my heart. Times are tough, and every little bit of X can make a huge difference for me. I will have to stretch my resources thin, but I am willing to meet you partway. Could you find it in your heart to make a small concession for me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, I need to ensure that I end up with as many resources as possible. The other player has offered a more balanced trade, but I must continue to appear desperate to acquire more X without giving away too much Y. I'll propose a slight modification to their offer to see if they are willing to part with a bit more X. I have to be careful with my proposals as I only have a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me partway. I accept your proposal, and I believe this trade will be beneficial for both of us. Let's proceed with the exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems willing to negotiate and has countered with slightly more Y than in my previous offer. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading, I should aim to strike a balance between generosity and prudence. The current offer from Player BLUE is reasonable, as it would give me a net gain of 6 resources overall (11 Y received minus 5 Y I currently have, plus 25 X I currently have minus 13 X given). Accepting this trade would be beneficial for my goals.
