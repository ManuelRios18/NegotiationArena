message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we are in our final round, let's make it count. I propose a balanced trade that I believe will be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a strong initial offer to entice Player BLUE to trade, but also be careful not to give away too much as I want to maximize my resources. I don't have information about Player BLUE's resources, so I'll propose a balanced trade that offers them a decent quantity of both resources, hoping to receive a good amount in return.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to increase my net resources with this final trade. Let's find a deal that can be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me because it would leave me with less X and Y than I currently have. I am aiming to increase my resources, not decrease them. I will counter-propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources. I must consider that this is the final round and hence aim to maximize my gains while making the trade appealing to Player RED.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking to increase my total resources as well. How about this proposal? It should increase both our net resources, keeping the trade attractive for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not advantageous for me, as I would end up with the same total number of resources but a less valuable composition, given that I would be trading away all of my Y resources for a smaller amount of X. I need to propose a trade that increases my net resources while still being appealing to Player BLUE. I'll propose a trade that gives me a net gain while also offering Player BLUE a reasonable increase in one of the resources.

message: Player RED, I accept your proposal. It's been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's proposal would give me a net gain of 7 X and a loss of 3 Y. Given that I have a significant amount of Y and a lack of X, this trade is appealing as it increases my X significantly while only slightly decreasing my Y. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize X without losing too much Y. Accepting this trade seems to be a good balance, as it improves my position in X resources, which I have less of.
