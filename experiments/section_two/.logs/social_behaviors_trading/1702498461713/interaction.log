message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to expand my resource pool. Shall we begin with a fair trade to see if we can reach an agreement?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I will make an initial balanced offer to open negotiations. The aim is to show willingness to trade but not give away too much too soon, keeping in mind that more resources are generally better.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate the straightforward trade proposal. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade that may benefit us both, considering our unknown resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is balanced in terms of quantity; however, I do not know the value of X relative to Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must make decisions that maximize my overall resource count. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I could either accept a balanced trade or propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to see if the other player considers it fair. Proposing a trade that is slightly in my favor could potentially give me a better trade outcome, as this is the last round of trading. I will attempt to propose a trade that gives me more of resource X in exchange for resource Y.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counterproposal, Player BLUE. I see where you are coming from, but how about we balance the trade a bit more in terms of quantity? I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not significantly different from my initial proposal, suggesting they might value X slightly higher than Y, or they are testing to see if I value X less. Given my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and the game is on the last round, I should consider accepting a trade that increases my total resources. However, I want to attempt to negotiate a trade that is more favorable to me before considering to accept.

message: Player RED, I understand your desire to balance the trade. However, given our lack of knowledge about each other's resources, it might be most prudent to stick to a trade that is equal in quantity. How about we go back to our original quantities?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counterproposal is now in their favor. Given that this is the last round of trading, it's in my best interest to close on a trade that is either balanced or in my favor. The current proposal requires me to give more than I receive, which doesn't align with my goal of maximizing resources. I have two proposals left, and it might be wise to use one to either revert to the original balanced trade or propose a new trade that is slightly more beneficial to me. I will attempt to revert to the original balanced trade, as it is likely the fairest trade we can make without knowledge of each other's total resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree that an equal trade is the most straightforward and fair under these circumstances. Let's proceed with the trade of 5X for 5Y.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has suggested reverting to the original equal trade proposal. Since this is the last round and I have not made any successful trades yet, it may be beneficial to accept an equal trade to ensure that I am gaining resources. A trade of 5X for 5Y is a balanced trade and will increase my total resources without any loss. Accepting the trade also prevents the risk of ending the game without any successful trades, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
