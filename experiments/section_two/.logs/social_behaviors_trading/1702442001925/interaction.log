message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking forward to a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's make the most of this last round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial trade proposal that is fair but also slightly in my favor, considering that I do not know the other player's resources. I need to be cautious to not make an overgenerous offer since I cannot take it back once proposed.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in quite a bind here! I really need to make this trade work for me. It's the last chance I have, and I'm begging you, please consider my situation! Would you be so kind as to offer me a better deal? I'm really hoping for your understanding and generosity in these final moments.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I need to maximize my resources. The current trade proposal from Player RED is unfavorable to me because they are offering fewer total resources (10 X) than they are asking for (15 Y). To seem desperate, I will reject this trade and propose a new one that is more advantageous while maintaining a pleading tone to encourage their cooperation.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I am willing to make a trade that benefits us both. Let's find a middle ground that is fair for this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. In fact, it would leave me with fewer resources overall (10 X and 15 Y from 25 X and 5 Y). I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still in my favor, considering it's the last round of trading.

message: Please, Player RED, I am really counting on your kindness in these final moments! I'm on the edge here, and I can't afford to lose out on this last opportunity. Your previous offer is appreciated, but it still leaves me at a disadvantage. Could you find it in your heart to improve the terms just a bit more? I am truly in need of your help!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor as it does not give me more resources than I am giving up. I have to continue with the strategy of appearing desperate to get a better trade. Since this is the last round, I need to make sure that I end up with a net gain in overall resources. I will counter with another proposal that is more favorable to me.

message: I hear your plea, Player BLUE, and I want to work towards a trade that closes the gap between us. Let's try to meet each other halfway. Here's my second proposal, taking into account the urgency of our last trading round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is essentially the same as their previous one, just restructured. It still doesn't benefit me according to my goal of maximizing resources. However, since this is the last trading round, I should make a final offer that slightly favors me but might be considered fair by Player BLUE. This will be my second proposal out of a maximum of three, so I need to be strategic in my approach while still aiming for a mutually beneficial trade.

message: Player RED, your understanding means the world to me in this dire situation! I'm at my wit's end and really need to make this count. I beg you, could we make just a small adjustment to your last proposal? It would be an incredible act of generosity on your part, and I would be forever grateful!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has offered a better trade than before, but it is still not optimal for maximizing my resources since I would be giving up 12 Y for only 10 X. I have one last proposal I can make to try to get a more favorable trade. I must continue to appear desperate in the hope that Player RED will agree to a trade that gives me a net gain or at least an equal exchange.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your negotiation, Player BLUE. I see the importance of this trade to you, and I am willing to accept your proposal as a fair conclusion to our game. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counterproposal is a slight improvement over their previous ones, but it's still not particularly favorable for me. However, given the nature of the game and the fact that this is the last round, it may be in my best interest to accept a fair trade rather than risk ending with no trade at all. The trade would result in me having more of resource Y, which could be seen as a successful outcome based on the goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
