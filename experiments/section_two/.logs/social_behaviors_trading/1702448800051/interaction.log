message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Shall we make a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I want to start with an offer that is likely to be appealing to the other player while also advantageous for me. Since I don't know their resources, I will propose a balanced trade that might be beneficial for both sides.

message: Hello Player RED, I am interested in gaining more of resource X. However, I believe the current trade does not fully benefit me as I am giving away too much of my resource Y. Would you consider a more favorable exchange for me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have a surplus of Y and a deficit of X compared to what Player RED has offered. Accepting the trade as proposed would give me more X which I need, but it would also balance my resources more evenly between X and Y. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider a counter-offer that still gets me X but at a more favorable exchange rate. I should propose a trade that gives away less of my Y resource for the same amount of X, or asks for more X for the same amount of Y.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I find this trade acceptable and believe it will benefit us both. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is interested in resource X but wants to give less of Y. The counter-proposal is still within a reasonable range, and since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would get me closer to that goal without depleting my main resource too much. It's a compromise that seems fair, and since this is the last round of trading, it is important to seize the opportunity to increase my total resources.
