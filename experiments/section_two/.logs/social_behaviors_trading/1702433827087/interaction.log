message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose we start with a straightforward trade to benefit us both. I suggest the following exchange, but I'm open to counter-offers if this doesn't suit your strategy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and I do not know what resources Player BLUE has, I should make an initial proposal that is fair but also advantageous for me. Since 'X' and 'Y' are the only resources available, I will assume that they have equal value and propose a trade that would give me more of one type without losing too much of the other.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I find your trade proposal to be fair and beneficial for my goals. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade offers me more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for some of my more abundant resource Y. Accepting this trade would increase my overall resource count, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Additionally, since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources now as there won't be future opportunities to trade.
