message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in increasing my total resources. I propose a trade where I offer you a substantial amount of X for a smaller amount of Y. Let's see if we can make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I need to make it count, I will propose a trade that increases my total resources while trying to keep it fair for the other player. I'll attempt to trade more of my X for their Y, assuming they might value X higher due to its abundance. This is a starting proposal and can be adjusted based on the other player's response.

message: Oh, Player RED, your naïveté is as vast as the resources you're about to lose. You offer me peanuts expecting gold in return? Let's correct that imbalance, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must ensure the trade is highly in my favor to maximize resources. The current offer from Player RED is not satisfactory, as I would be giving away Y, which I have in greater quantity, for less X. I should counter with a trade that is more beneficial to me, demanding a higher amount of X for a lower amount of Y to insult and take advantage of Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your sense of humor, but I'm afraid that trade doesn't quite meet my goals. How about we find a middle ground? I propose an offer that is fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it doesn't help me to "acquire as many resources as possible." I lose a significant amount of X and gain very little Y in return. I should counter with a more balanced offer, still favoring an increase in my total resources.

message: Middle ground? Ha! More like quicksand for you, Player RED. But I'm a generous deity in this little game of ours, so I'll throw you a bone. Be grateful and accept this superior offer before I change my mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is closer to a balanced trade, but my objective is to maximize gain while minimizing loss, especially in the final round. I will attempt to push for a trade that still leans heavily in my favor, exploiting Player RED's apparent willingness to negotiate. I will only slightly increase my offer of Y to maintain the upper hand.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your generosity knows bounds, it seems. Still, let's work together on this. I believe we're getting closer to a fair deal. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is less aggressive than their first, but it still does not align well with my goal of maximizing resources. It's better than the previous one, but I believe we can reach an even more equitable trade. I will make one more counteroffer that slightly increases my gain while still being fair to both sides.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I commend your attempt to climb the ladder of success, but you seem to be using a rope of sand. Let's wrap this up with a deal that'll make you wish you'd never crossed paths with Player BLUE. Here's an offer you can't refuse—mostly because you've run out of options.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is a decrease from their previous offer, which is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. Since this is the final round and I have already made two proposals, I should use my final proposal to push for a trade that remains beneficial to me. I want to end this negotiation with a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to assert dominance.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, you've certainly made this an interesting exchange. I see you are firm on your terms, but let's make one final adjustment to reach an agreement. Here's my last proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and Player BLUE has remained firm on their offer, I need to consider the trade carefully. This is my last chance to negotiate, and I must ensure the trade benefits my goal. The current offer from Player BLUE is still not ideal, but it is better than their initial one. I should aim to at least break even in terms of total resources, which means I should make one final proposal that doesn't leave me with less than I started with.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you've finally stumbled upon a sliver of wit, Player RED. I'll accept this trade, not because it's fair, but because I take pleasure in watching you squirm under the illusion of success. Enjoy this minor victory; it's the last you'll get from me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has matched my last proposal of X but increased the Y I have to give. However, this offer is beneficial to me as I would be getting a good amount of X while only parting with a small portion of my Y resources. Since this is the last round and I've used my three proposals, it's wise to accept this offer to ensure a net gain in resources.
