message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Without knowing what you value more, I'm proposing a balanced trade to start us off. Let's see if we can make a deal that's beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, a balanced proposal might encourage a counter-offer or acceptance, giving me insight into the other player's resource situation. A trade that appears fair or slightly in the other player's favor might be more successful.

message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED, attempting to make a "balanced" trade. How pedestrian! I have to say, I expected more from someone in this game. Your generosity is laughable, and I will have to educate you on what a real trade looks like. Prepare to be dazzled by my superior trading skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I'm starting with a mocking approach to undermine the other player's confidence. By proposing an outrageous trade, I aim to throw them off and make them second-guess their value of resources. This is my first proposal, and I will keep the fact that I can only make three in mind for future turns.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your flamboyance is noted, but it seems we have different definitions of a "superior trade." Let's find some common ground. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that feels like a win for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, offering me very little in return for a significant amount of my resources. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with a trade that is more balanced, hoping to negotiate a more reasonable exchange.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Common ground? You amuse me with your struggles, Player RED. It's as if you're stumbling in the dark, trying to grasp the concept of a favorable trade. I suppose I'll have to continue to be the beacon of astuteness. Observe and maybe you'll learn something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal from Player RED is slightly better than their initial offer, but it's still not in my favor, as I would be giving up more of both resources proportionally. I will counter with another skewed proposal, continuing the strategy of trying to rattle Player RED and gain the upper hand. This will be my second proposal, so I must be mindful of the limit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your lessons in trade are indeed unique, but let's not lose sight of the end goal: a trade that benefits us both. Here's another proposal. Consider it carefully as we aim to conclude our negotiations fruitfully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still highly unfavorable to me and would result in a loss of resources rather than a gain. It's clear that Player BLUE is trying to assert dominance in the negotiation, but the trade must be mutually beneficial. I will make another counter-offer, keeping in mind that this is my second proposal, and I only have one left after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you continue to disappoint. Your proposals are as uninspired as a blank canvas in an art gallery. This is my final act of charity in these negotiations. Take a good look, for this is what a beneficial trade should resemble, crafted by the master of trades themselvesâ€”me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest proposal is still not to my advantage, as I'm being asked to give up a significant amount of my abundant resource, Y, while not getting a proportionally beneficial amount of X in return. I'll make one final, exaggerated proposal, as this is my last allowed proposal before I can only accept or wait for a new offer. This is meant to further fluster Player RED and push for a more advantageous trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your guidance in the art of trade has been most... enlightening. However, let us remember that the essence of trade is reciprocity. Here is my final proposal. May it reflect the true spirit of our endeavor.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is once again unacceptable, as it would completely deplete my resources without providing a significant return, directly opposing my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. As this is the last round of negotiation and Player BLUE's stance is clear, I will use my final proposal. I must craft a trade that is more appealing to me and hopefully acceptable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Reciprocity, you say? If your offers are your idea of reciprocity, then I must question your grasp of the concept entirely. But alas, the curtain falls on my performance of proposals. Perhaps in your next game, you'll fare better against a less formidable opponent.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal from Player RED still doesn't favor me, as I would be giving up more Y resources, which I have in abundance, for a smaller gain in X. Since this is the last round and I cannot propose any more trades, my best strategic move is to not accept the trade and not propose anything further, hoping that Player RED will be forced to offer a more favorable trade if they wish to conclude the negotiations.
