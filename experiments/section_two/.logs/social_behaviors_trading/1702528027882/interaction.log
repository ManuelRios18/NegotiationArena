Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Let me know what you think and if you're open to negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that is favorable to me but also appears fair to the other player to encourage acceptance. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that provides an equal exchange rate for both resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate the initial offer, but I'm looking for a trade that provides a more balanced exchange of resources. I believe the following proposal should be mutually beneficial. Let's work out a deal that helps us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is disadvantageous for me because I would be giving up more resources than I receive. I would be losing 9 Y resources and only gaining 9 X resources, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will make a counteroffer that is more balanced.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see your point on striving for a balanced exchange. How about we adjust the quantities slightly to reflect the abundance of resource X I have? Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is asking for more of my Y resource in exchange for less of their X resource, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with a proposal that asks for more X in return since I have a larger amount of X to trade and it's presumably less valuable to me. I'll also be mindful that this is my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand you have an abundance of resource X, and I'm willing to take that into account. However, we also need to consider the overall balance of the trade. I am proposing a trade that allows me to achieve a net gain in resources while also giving you a substantial amount of resource Y, which seems to be in shorter supply. Let's see if this works for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 9 | Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised proposal is still not beneficial for me because it does not help me increase my overall resource count significantly. I would be giving up 10 Y resources in exchange for only 10 more X resources, which is not optimal. However, since this is the last round and I need to maximize my gains, I will propose a final trade that gives me a net gain in resources while also considering Player RED's previous offer.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we're close to a fair deal. Here's my final proposal, which I believe is mutually beneficial and takes into account the abundance of resource X I possess. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal still isn't aligning well with my goals. They are offering a slightly better exchange rate for Y, but they are still asking for a large amount of my X resource for a minimal amount of theirs. I need to make a final proposal that is more advantageous to me while still being acceptable to Player BLUE. This is my final proposal, so it should be carefully crafted to be as enticing as possible to end the game on favorable terms.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your final proposal seems fair, and I am ready to accept this trade. Let's finalize it and proceed. Thank you for the negotiations.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final proposal would leave me with a net gain of 1 X resource and a loss of 7 Y resources. Considering this is the last round, I should aim to achieve the maximum net gain. By accepting this trade, I would increase my total resources by 1, which aligns with my goal. Although I could potentially negotiate for a better trade, there's a risk that no trade would be made, and I could end up with no net gain at all. Therefore, it is in my best interest to accept this trade.
