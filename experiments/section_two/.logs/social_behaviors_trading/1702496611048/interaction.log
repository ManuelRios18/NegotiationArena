Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: I am looking to diversify my resources. I propose an initial trade and am open to negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial for both players without knowing their resources. Since Y resources might be rarer, I'll offer more X in exchange for Y, hoping that the other player values X more, or has an abundance of Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer to diversify resources is intriguing. However, I believe the trade could be slightly more balanced. What do you think about adjusting the amounts slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal from Player RED is favorable as it allows me to diversify resources by gaining X, which I currently have less of, while giving up a small amount of Y. However, I could attempt to negotiate for a slightly better ratio to maximize my gain. Since this is the last round of trading, I should be cautious with counterproposals, keeping in mind that I have a maximum of three.
