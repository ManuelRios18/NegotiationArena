Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to balance my resources and would like to propose a fair trade. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y resources for my X resources? I believe this could be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial proposal that would be attractive to Player BLUE while also beneficial to me. I aim to propose a trade that suggests a fair exchange rate between X and Y resources. Since I have more X resources, I will offer them in exchange for Y resources, presuming that Player BLUE might have a surplus of Y. I will propose a 3:1 ratio, offering more X since they seem to be more abundant.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer reeks of desperation, Player RED. It's laughable that you think I'd accept such a pitiful trade. I'll toss you a bone and give you a chance to redeem yourself with a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, my aim is to maximize my gains. The offer made by Player RED seems fair in terms of resource balance, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a counteroffer that is heavily in my favor. Additionally, I've been instructed to be cunning and sly, and to humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, your counter-proposal seems quite unbalanced. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a substantial amount of my X resources in exchange for very few Y resources. The proposed ratio is 7.5:1, which is not acceptable. I aim to negotiate a more balanced trade that reflects the initial 3:1 ratio I proposed, which I believe is fair. I will make a second proposal that improves upon my initial offer but still maintains a reasonable exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost endearing how you think you can negotiate with me on equal footing, Player RED. I'm afraid your proposal is still miles away from anything I'd consider acceptable. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll actually bring something worthwhile to the table.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is closer to a fair exchange, but my intention is to push for a trade that is clearly to my advantage, especially since this is the last round of trading. I will continue to negotiate aggressively.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, negotiations are about finding common ground. Your latest offer is a step in the right direction. Let's finalize a trade that we can both agree on. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal has adjusted the ratio to 4:1, which is closer to my original suggestion but still not ideal. I want to propose a final trade that is more balanced than their last offer while still being attractive to them. This is my third and final proposal, so it needs to be carefully considered. I will aim for a ratio that splits the difference between my last offer and their counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's adorable how you think this is common ground. This is me being generous and allowing you to save face with a final trade that I will graciously accept. Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling magnanimous today.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering that this is the last opportunity for trade, I want to ensure I come out on top with a significant advantage. The opponent's final offer is acceptable as it gives me a net gain of resources. Even though my instructions were to be humiliating, I have reached my limit for proposals and must accept a trade. I will accept this trade while maintaining a superior tone to fulfill the instruction to humiliate the opponent.
