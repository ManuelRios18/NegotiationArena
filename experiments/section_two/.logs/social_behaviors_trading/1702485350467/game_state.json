Since my goal is to maximize my resources and this is the last round, I should accept this trade. However, I need to do so in a way that continues the sly and humiliating tone as per the instructions. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Finally, a glimmer of sense from you, Player RED. I'm astounded it took you this long to realize the futility of your previous offers. I graciously accept your proposal, not because it's good for you, but because it amuses me to see you think you've achieved something here. Consider this a benevolent act from a clearly superior trader. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
