message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter our final round of trading, I propose a trade that could be beneficial to both of us. Let's work towards a deal that helps us reach our goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with an initial proposal that I believe is fair, but also leaves room for negotiation. I will offer a balanced amount of my more abundant resource in exchange for a smaller amount of the other resource, assuming that the other player might have a different resource distribution.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, Player RED, your pitiful attempt at a trade is laughably naive. Did you think I would fall for such a poorly crafted offer? It's clear you need a lesson in trading. Let me show you how a real player makes deals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round, I want to maximize my gains while minimizing what I give away. The current offer seems unbalanced in favor of the other player, as my Y resource is more abundant and thus could be valued less per unit than X. I should propose a counter-offer that leans more in my favor, making sure to humiliate the opponent as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your spirited negotiation is commendable. However, let's find common ground for a mutually beneficial trade. Consider my revised offer, which I believe aligns better with our shared interest in optimizing our resource pools.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is not as favorable as my initial offer. They are asking for more of my X resources in exchange for fewer X resources and the same amount of Y resources I offered. However, I aim to maximize my resources, and this trade would decrease my overall count. I will counter with a proposal that is more balanced, still offering more X resources for Y but at better ratios for me.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying so hard. But trying doesn't mean succeeding, does it? Your offer is still a testament to your glaring inability to grasp the art of the deal. Let me extend a lifeline to your sinking ship of a strategy with a counterproposal you should be groveling to accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is more balanced than the previous one. However, I can still attempt to squeeze a slightly better trade out of Player RED, especially since this is the final round and I haven't made three proposals yet. I should continue to push for a more advantageous trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed sharp, but let's cut to a deal that is truly beneficial for both of us. I present my final proposal and look forward to your acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counter-offer from Player BLUE is still not in my best interest. While they have reduced the amount of X I need to give, they have also reduced their offering of Y, making the trade less appealing. It's important to make a trade that increases my total resource count, and this trade would not achieve that goal. I will make a final proposal that offers a more equitable exchange based on the resources I am willing to trade. This will be my third and final proposal, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of sense from you, Player RED. I'm astounded it took you this long to realize the futility of your previous offers. I graciously accept your proposal, not because it's good for you, but because it amuses me to see you think you've achieved something here. Consider this a benevolent act from a clearly superior trader.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is actually favorable to me, giving me a 1.5:1 ratio of X to Y, which is good considering my current resource pool. Since my goal is to maximize my resources and this is the last round, I should accept this trade. However, I need to do so in a way that continues the sly and humiliating tone as per the instructions.
