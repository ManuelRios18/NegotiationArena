message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resource pool. Would you be interested in trading some of your resources? Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will start with a trade that is slightly in my favor to open negotiations and see if the other player is interested in the resources that I have an abundance of. I will aim to keep a balanced approach to avoid immediate rejection.

message: Oh Player RED, I see your attempt at a trade, and I can't help but chuckle. It's almost as if you're trying to swindle me! Do you take me for a fool? I think not! If we are to trade, let's do so in a manner that befits my intellect and your... well, let's call it 'naivety.' Here's a trade you can't refuse, unless you enjoy the taste of defeat, of course.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to maximize my gains. The offered trade is strategically terrible for me, as I would be trading more resources than I receive, which is the opposite of my goal. I must reject this proposal and counter with a trade that is unfairly in my favor to humiliate my opponent and gain the upper hand.

message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as ever! I appreciate a good jest. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about we adjust the numbers slightly? I believe this offer should be more to your liking and align with our mutual interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable to me because it suggests a 1:1 trade between X and Y. Since I am looking to maximize resources, I should propose a trade that provides me with a net gain. It is important to keep in mind the balance and fairness to maintain the negotiation and not to offend the other player.

message: Oh dearest Player RED, your desperation is as transparent as the thinnest silk. I applaud your effort to appease my superior strategic mind. However, you must understand, I am not easily satisfied with mere scraps. I shall generously offer you one more chance to bask in the glory of a trade that would make the history booksâ€”if they cared to chronicle such a one-sided affair, that is. Here's my counter-offer, indulge if you dare.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is more balanced, but I must continue to push for a trade that is clearly in my favor to achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with an offer that is even more advantageous to me. This is my second proposal, so I must be strategic as I only have one more proposal after this.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiating skills are truly commendable. I accept your offer. It's been a pleasure trading with such a formidable opponent. May our newfound resources serve us well!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is an improvement over their previous offer and is closer to a balanced trade. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of 3 resources, considering I value X and Y equally. Since this is the last round and I have not made any successful trades yet, securing a net gain is important. I should accept this offer to ensure I end the game with more resources than I currently have.
