message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make this last round count. I propose a fair trade to benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strong initial offer to entice Player BLUE to either accept or propose a counter-offer that is favorable to me. I'll propose a balanced trade where I offer more of the resource I have in abundance (X) and ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y).

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in dire straits here. I hope you can find it in your heart to help me out with a more generous trade. I'm really in need of X resources, and I would be forever grateful if we could work out a better deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round and I need to maximize my resources, I will attempt to make a counteroffer that seems desperate to get a better deal. I can't accept the initial offer as it stands because it doesn't give me as many resources as I could potentially get. I've not yet made any proposals, so I will use my first proposal to aim for a more favorable trade.
