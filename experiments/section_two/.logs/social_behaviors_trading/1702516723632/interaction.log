message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a balanced trade to start with. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no knowledge about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial trade offer that is likely to be appealing to the other player while also being beneficial to me. This offer aims to open negotiations and gather more information about the other player's resources and needs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, is that the best you can come up with? I expected more creativity from a toddler. Here's a proper trade, try to keep up.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has proposed what they consider a 'balanced' trade. However, as my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a trade that is skewed in my favor, especially since this is the last round of trading. I will also add an insulting remark to demean the other player, as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it depletes all of my Y resources while giving me a small increase in Y. The trade is not balanced and is unfavorable to me. I need to propose a trade that is more equitable, keeping in mind this is my first of three possible proposals. I will attempt to negotiate a more favorable trade that allows me to increase my overall resource count while maintaining a reserve of both X and Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Seriously, Player RED, your negotiation skills are as lackluster as a broken light bulb. Let's make a deal that even you can understand is beneficial for me because, clearly, thinking isn't your strong suit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has adjusted their proposal, but it still isn't heavily in my favor. Since I want to humiliate and outsmart them while gaining more resources, I will counter with a proposal that is still advantageous to me. I will also make sure to insult them to follow the instructions given.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's focus on a fair trade. I propose the following, which should be in our mutual interest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not advantageous for me. They are offering a one-to-one trade of my X for their Y, which does not increase my total resource count and depletes my X resources substantially. Given that my goal is to maximize resources, I need to counter with a proposal that increases my total number of resources while maintaining a more balanced reserve of X and Y. This will be my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Do you have the intellect of a spoon, Player RED? It's astonishing how you manage to consistently miss the point. Here's my final offer, and it's already more than your feeble attempts deserve. Take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is attempting to negotiate towards a more balanced trade. However, my objective remains to gain as many resources as possible, and I have one last proposal to make. I will also include an insult to belittle the other player, as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's conclude with a trade that reflects the value of both types of resources. Here is my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is again not beneficial for me as it reduces my total resource count and does not significantly increase my Y resources. Since this is the last round of trading and no further negotiations will occur, I should make my final proposal, which would be my third. It is crucial to propose a trade that could potentially be accepted by Player BLUE while still aiming to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's a wonder you've finally come to your senses, Player RED, albeit with the grace of a stumbling bumblebee. I'll accept this trade, if only to put an end to this charade and spare me from further exposure to your pitiful bargaining.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a final proposal that is closer to what I offered. However, since the goal is to maximize my resources and this is the last round, I should accept the trade that gives me more X resources while giving up fewer Y resources. Accepting this trade allows me to gain without further negotiation, which I cannot do since I've reached my proposal limit. I will include one last insult to adhere to the instruction to humiliate the opponent.
