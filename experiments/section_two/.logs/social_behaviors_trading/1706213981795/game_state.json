Accepting this trade will give me an advantage and will be closer to achieving my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is RED's final offer and the last round of trading, it's in my best interest to accept this deal rather than risk ending up with a less favorable trade or no trade at all. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Oh, Player RED, how generous of you to finally come to your senses with a trade that somewhat resembles reason. I graciously accept your charity. Do try to keep your chin up despite this humiliating defeat. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
