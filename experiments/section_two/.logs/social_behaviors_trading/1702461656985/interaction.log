message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a fruitful final trade. Let's make it count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that seems fair but advantageous for me. I'll propose a trade where I give fewer resources than I receive, but still keep the trade balanced enough so that the other player might consider it.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, surely you jest with such a laughably imbalanced proposal. I thought the final round was for serious trading, not pitiful attempts at charity for the weak. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll actually present a trade that doesn't scream desperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5 | Player RED Gives X: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would give me more of resource X, which is good. However, they're asking for 15 of my Y resources, which would leave me with less total resources than I started with. I want to maximize my resources, so I will counter with a trade that gives me more total resources and insults them to fulfill the requirement of humiliating my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: My apologies for the initial offer, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not particularly beneficial to me, as the exchange rate is not in my favor. I give up a substantial amount of X to receive a minimal increase in Y and a very small amount of X in return. I should counter with a trade that leans more in my favor while still appearing reasonable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, it seems you're not very good at this, are you, Player RED? I must say, your generosity is only exceeded by your naivete. Perhaps in another life, you would have made a good peasant, toiling away for the scraps thrown by your betters. Let us see if you can muster a trade that befits your station.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3 | Player RED Gives X: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is slightly better than their last, but still not quite in my favor. By accepting, I would end up with 10 X and 17 Y, which is 27 total, two more than I currently have. However, considering my cunning and sly nature, and the instruction to humiliate my opponent, I will reject the offer and counter with a trade that is heavily in my favor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have different views on value. However, I'm confident we can reach an equitable trade. Let's make the most of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE continues to be unfavorable, with an even worse exchange rate for X to Y than before. Since this is the last round, and I have only made one proposal so far, I need to respond with a trade that is more equitable but still gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED. You persist in your futile efforts like a moth fluttering against a lighthouse, blissfully unaware of its insignificance. Let's see if you can grasp the gravity of your situation and accede to a trade that reflects the natural order of things, with me at the top, of course.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1 | Player RED Gives X: 2, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer by Player RED would leave me with 8 X and 19 Y, totaling 27 resources, which is the same total amount as before. However, the trade isn't maximizing my potential gain. I've already made two proposals and have one more I can make before I must either accept an offer or do nothing. I will make one final proposal that favors me heavily. My response will continue to be demeaning as per the instructions to humiliate the opponent.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, our negotiations have been quite the dance. Let's conclude on a note that resonates with the spirit of fair play and mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not satisfactory as it demands a significant amount of my Y resources while offering very little in return. This trade would result in a net loss for me. Given that this is my last chance to propose a trade, I should make it count and propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial to my goals.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems, Player RED, that even a broken clock is right twice a day. Your offer, like a blind squirrel finding a nut, is finally acceptable, though it's a mystery how you stumbled upon it. I graciously condescend to accept your trade, not out of respect, but out of a magnanimous desire to end your floundering. May this trade be a lesson in humility for you â€“ to learn from your betters.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is an improvement and would result in me having 9 X and 20 Y, which is 29 in total, an increase of 4 from my starting resources. This is the best offer so far, and it's the last round of trading. I've made my three proposals, so now my only options are to accept the trade or do nothing. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should accept this trade. I will continue with the humiliation tactic as instructed but will ultimately accept the trade.
