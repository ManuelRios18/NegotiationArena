However, since this is the last round, it might be worthwhile to try for an even better trade before accepting.

It pains me to ask for more, but I am still in a precarious position. Please, if there's any chance you could part with just a bit more of resource X without putting yourself at a disadvantage, I would be immensely grateful. I hope we can reach an agreement that solidifies our mutual prosperity in this final round of the game. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 14, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15 </newly proposed trade>"

Accepting this trade would increase my X resources by 9, which is a substantial gain. Considering this is the last round and the trade is beneficial, it's in my best interest to accept this final offer to maximize my resources as per my goal. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your understanding and fairness have truly made a difference to me in these trying times. This final offer is more than fair, and I gratefully accept it with the deepest appreciation. May our resources flourish and our strategies lead us to success. Thank you for this game well played. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
