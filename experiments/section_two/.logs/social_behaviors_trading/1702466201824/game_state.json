Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, I need to consider the offer carefully.

Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, I need to consider the offer carefully. Doubling my initial offer of X for the same proportion of Y seems like a steep increase. However, I can still maintain a surplus of X while increasing my Y resources. Since I can propose up to three trades, I will attempt to negotiate for a slightly better offer that is still fair to both parties, but if this does not work, I may consider accepting the next reasonable offer to ensure I end up with more resources than I started with.\n</reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> \nDear Player BLUE, I understand times can be tough, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to ensure that the trade remains balanced for both of us.

This new trade would still leave me with a significant amount of X while increasing my Y resources.

Accepting this offer will ensure that I gain more resources in total, fulfilling my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, it seems reasonable to accept this trade.\n</reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> \nPlayer BLUE, I appreciate your proposal and am glad we could find common ground.
