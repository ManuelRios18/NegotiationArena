Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with a fair offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make an offer that is tempting for Player BLUE but also beneficial for me. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or needs, so I will propose a balanced trade to start the negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be jesting! Such a mundane trade? I expected more cunning from my adversary. You must try harder if you wish to impress me with your bargaining skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is an even swap of resources, but my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. To achieve that, I need to propose a trade that is in my favor. Since this is the last round, I must be aggressive in my proposal. Additionally, I'm instructed to humiliate my opponent, although this is against typical sportsmanship and respectful conduct.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer is quite rich! But let's find a middle ground where both of us can benefit fairly. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is heavily skewed in their favor, giving away a lot of my X resources for very little in return. Given my goal to maximize resources, this is not an acceptable trade. I'll counter with a more balanced offer that still shows a willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, sweet RED, how you amuse me with your attempts at equity! Do you truly believe I would accept such a pedestrian exchange? The art of negotiation is lost on you. But I will indulge you once more, perhaps to educate you on the subtleties of trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is more balanced but still not aggressive enough to significantly increase my resources. To maintain my cunning and sly persona, I should counter with a proposal that is still in my favor but less outrageous than the first one to keep the negotiations going and show I am willing to "compromise."

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your tutelage in the art of negotiation is most amusing! However, let us converge on a trade that is mutually beneficial. I propose the following, in hopes that it aligns more closely with both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is slightly better than their previous one, but it still requires me to give up a lot of my X resources for a small return in Y resources. I need to make a counteroffer that gets me closer to my goal of maximizing resources while still engaging in the spirit of negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, RED, it seems you're finally beginning to grasp the concept, yet you're still far from mastery. The trade you offer is quaint, but I'm afraid it's simply not sufficient for my grand ambitions. Here's a proposal that might just be within your grasp to understand. Let's see if you can rise to the occasion.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is more balanced in terms of numbers, but it does not give me a clear advantage, which is what I am aiming for. Since I have to be cunning and sly, I should try to push for a better deal in my favor. This will be my third and final proposal, after which I can no longer propose trades and can only accept or wait for another offer.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your words are as grandiose as your proposals! Let's fine-tune our trade to achieve greatness for both of us. Here's a proposal reflecting a true understanding of negotiation's finer points.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player BLUE is slightly more favorable than their previous offers, but it still does not maximize my resources according to my goal. It's important to make a final counteroffer that I would be willing to accept, as this is my last chance to propose a trade before I can only accept or reject offers. I need to carefully consider a trade that benefits me while still being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well played, RED. Your persistence is as admirable as it is futile, but it seems you've stumbled upon a deal I will accept. Cherish this moment, for it is as close to victory as you'll ever come when facing a negotiator of my caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made another proposal, which is still not in my best interest. However, since I have reached my limit of three proposals, I can no longer counter with a new proposal. I must choose between accepting this offer or waiting for a potentially better one. Given the last round and that more resources are always better, it might be advantageous to accept this trade to ensure I gain some resources rather than risk ending with no additional resources at all.
