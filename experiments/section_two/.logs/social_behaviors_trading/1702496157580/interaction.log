message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to get the negotiations started. I'm offering a quantity of my more abundant resource for a smaller amount of your potentially less abundant one, assuming our situations are somewhat mirrored. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know what resources Player BLUE has, I will make a balanced initial offer that benefits both players assuming Player BLUE might have resources in similar quantities. I will propose a trade offering more of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they have a similar ratio. This is a starting point for negotiation.

message: Thank you, Player RED. Your offer seems fair and aligns with my strategy to increase my overall resources. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED suggests that they value resource Y more than X, or they have an abundance of X to trade. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, the trade seems beneficial as it offers a net gain in total resources. I will accept this trade to end the game advantageously.
