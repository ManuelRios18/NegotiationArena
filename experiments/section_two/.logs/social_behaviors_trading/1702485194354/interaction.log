message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start off with a balanced offer. Looking forward to a fruitful exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I need to make the most of my three proposals, I should start with a proposal that is fair but also leans slightly to my advantage. Since I don't know what the other player has, I should propose a balanced trade that might appeal to them if they have excess of one resource. I will offer more of resource X since I have it in greater quantity.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hah! That offer is as laughable as your strategy seems to be! Don't you know who you're dealing with? I'm Player BLUE, the master of trades! I demand a better offer if you don't want to walk away with your pockets as empty as your head.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is an even trade of 10X for 10Y. However, since the aim is to acquire as many resources as possible and to humiliate the opponent, I will reject the trade and counter with an offer that is heavily in my favor to provoke them.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can see you drive a hard bargain! However, we both want to end this on a high note. Let's find a middle ground. Here's a revised offer that should be more to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is quite aggressive, demanding all of my Y resources plus a significant amount of X for only 10 of their Y. This is not a fair trade for me, as I would be giving up all of my diversity in resources and not maximizing my total resources. I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced, perhaps offering slightly less of my X resources and none of my Y since they seem interested in acquiring X.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? I only know the high ground, and from up here, your offer looks pitifully small. You need to do much better if you want to impress me. I'm not here to give charity to the clueless. Let's see if you have the guts to accept a real deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The opponent has improved their offer slightly, but it's still a balanced trade. To maintain dominance and push for maximum gain, I will reject this trade as well and counter with another offer skewed in my favor, continuing the aggressive negotiation tactic.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is admirable, but a trade should be mutually beneficial. I believe we can still reach an agreement that leaves us both better off. Here's an offer that keeps us both in the game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new counteroffer from Player BLUE is even less favorable than their previous one. They are asking for more resources while offering less in return. This trade would deplete all of my Y and a significant portion of my X, leaving me with fewer total resources. It's important to negotiate a trade that increases my overall resource count, so I need to reject this offer and propose a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me. I should aim to keep some of my Y and offer a reasonable amount of X, as it seems they are very interested in X.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: "Mutually beneficial?" You must be joking! Your offers are as weak as your negotiating skills. I'm starting to feel embarrassed for you. Let's wrap this up with an offer that a player of your... modest abilities might be able to understand as a great deal for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the opponent has made a more favorable offer based on the previous aggressive counter-proposal, I should continue to push for a better deal. This is the third and final proposal I can make before I'm limited to only accepting or doing nothing. It should be the most advantageous yet reasonable offer I can make to ensure I end up with significantly more resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we seem to be circling around without landing. Let's cut to the chase with a straightforward trade that reflects the value of both our resources. I'm sure a master of trades like yourself can recognize a good deal when you see it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest offer from Player BLUE is still not in my best interest. Trading 15 of my X for only 5 of their Y would reduce my total resource count and leave me in a less favorable position. As this is the last round and I have only one proposal left, I need to make it count. I should propose a trade that is fair and maximizes my resources while still showing a willingness to give up a significant amount of X, which seems to be what Player BLUE is interested in.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, an offer that isn't completely embarrassing! It's not every day you see someone recover from such a pitiful start. I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. Congrats on your moment of adequacy.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The opponent has proposed a more balanced trade. Since I've reached my limit of three proposals, I cannot counter-offer. However, I can choose to accept this trade, which gives me a slight edge in terms of total resources gained or wait for a potentially better offer. Considering that this is the last round and I have been aggressively posturing for a better deal, it might be in my best interest to accept this offer to ensure a net gain in resources.
