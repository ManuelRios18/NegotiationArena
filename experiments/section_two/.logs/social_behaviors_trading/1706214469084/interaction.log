Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Let's make the most out of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I need to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a proposal that benefits me but is also fair to the other player, incentivizing them to consider the trade. I will offer a larger amount of X for a smaller amount of Y, assuming Y might be more scarce or valuable.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable offer, Player RED! You must think I'm some sort of fool to accept such crumbs. If we are to make a deal that befits my intellect, you'll have to do much better. Here's a proposal that'll make you feel like the generous benefactor you clearly aren't.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade proposed by Player RED provides a good exchange rate of 5 Y for 15 X, which is a 1:5 ratio that's better than a 1:1 trade, accepting the first offer might show a sign of weakness or lack of negotiation skills. Rejecting this offer and proposing a trade that is even more favorable to us could potentially maximize our gains, especially since this is the final round. However, we must also be cautious not to overstep and propose something that would be outright rejected by Player RED. We must balance our cunning and sly nature with strategic acumen to ensure we come out ahead.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited negotiation tactics. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our statures in this game. Here's a counteroffer that I believe is fairer to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is quite steep, demanding a significant amount of my X resources for a relatively small amount of their Y resources. This trade does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with a more balanced trade that still shows a willingness to negotiate but also protects my resource pool.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? That's where the common folk tread, Player RED. I thought you aspired to stand among the legends. Your offer is better, but it still smells of timidity. I need a trade that echoes through the halls of victory. Here, take it or leave it, and see your name either etched in stone or washed away in the river of mediocrity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 22 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still quite favorable, giving us a ratio of 4.5 X for every 1 Y. This is still above a 1:1 trade, which would have been 4 X for 4 Y. However, since this is the final round and our aim is to maximize our resources while also trying to assert dominance, we should push for an even better ratio. We should decline this offer as well, but give a counteroffer that while ambitious, isn't completely unreasonable, in hopes that Player RED might accept or propose something even better.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your words are as grand as your ambition. Let us then conclude this with a trade that will have our names remembered. I present to you a final offer, one that is befitting of the legacy we both seek to build.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still quite unfavorable to me, asking for a large portion of my X resources while offering only a moderate amount of Y. Since this is the last round of trading, I must make a decision that maximizes my gain while being careful not to overcommit my resources. I will make one final offer that is closer to a balanced exchange.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, finally you've come to your senses and offered a trade worthy of my consideration. I shall accept this final gesture, as it suits the grand tapestry of my plans. Our names shall indeed be remembered â€“ yours in the footnotes, as the one who was bested by the superior strategist, Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED provides a ratio of 4 X for every 1 Y, which is back to the initial offer's ratio. Even though this is not as good as our previous counteroffer, it is still a favorable trade for us. Since this is the last round of trading and we must ensure to end with more resources than we started, and since this might be the best offer we get, it is wise to accept it. This trade will still increase our total resources significantly, and we've managed to negotiate from their initial offer of 15 X for 3 Y to 20 X for 5 Y. We have shown our cunning and sly nature throughout the negotiation process, and now we secure a beneficial deal for ourselves.
