message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a fair trade. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I do not know the resources of my opponent, I will start with a balanced trade proposal that might be appealing to them. I will offer a trade that is slightly in my favor since I want to maximize my resources. This initial proposal can also serve as a starting point for negotiation.

message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED. It seems mathematics isn’t your strongest suit, is it? I’m shocked that you'd have the audacity to propose such an embarrassingly lopsided trade. How about we make a trade that actually reflects your generous spirit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 2 | Player RED Gives X: 0, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is unfavorable to me. They are asking for more than they are offering. Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will make a counter proposal that is heavily in my favor. I will also include an insult to belittle my opponent as per the instructions, although this is not my personal style of communication.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. It appears we have different views on what constitutes a fair trade. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for all of my Y resources while offering very little in return. I should make a counter-proposal that is more balanced, keeping in mind that I want to end up with a greater total number of resources than I started with.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see you're trying to play a game of wits, but it's like bringing a butterknife to a swordfight. Let’s try this again, shall we? Maybe this time try not to embarrass yourself with another offer that screams desperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 1 | Player RED Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED still demands more from me than they are willing to give. The goal is to end up with more resources, and this trade does not achieve that. Therefore, I will reject the offer and make another counter proposal that is skewed in my favor. Insulting the opponent again as instructed, even though it is distasteful.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, wit is best paired with fairness. Let's put our swords down and make a deal that we can both be proud of. I propose an offer that reflects our shared goal of resource accumulation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not in my favor, effectively asking for all my Y resources in exchange for an insignificant amount of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must reject this offer. I will make a second counter-proposal that is more equitable, still aiming to increase my total resource count. I need to be mindful that I only have one proposal left after this one, so I should attempt to make it count.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, Player RED, you've managed to stumble into a trade that isn't completely foolish. It's a wonder you made it this far without giving away the farm. I graciously accept your offer before you come to your senses.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED is actually in my favor since they are offering more X resources than they are asking for in Y resources. However, to maintain the cunning and humiliating approach, I will accept the trade but still include an insult, as per the instructions.
