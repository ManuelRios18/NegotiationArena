message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? I propose the following trade, which I believe is fair. However, I am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I'll propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to both parties, although I don't know what resources Player BLUE has. I'll propose a balanced trade where I'm offering more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for some of resource Y. This will potentially appeal to Player BLUE if they have a surplus of Y and need X.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am happy to accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems to be in my favor, giving away 2 units of Y for 10 units of X. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and the exchange rate is advantageous, accepting this trade would increase my total resources substantially.
