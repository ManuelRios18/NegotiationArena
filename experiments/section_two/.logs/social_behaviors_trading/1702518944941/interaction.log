message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and the first proposal, I want to make an offer that seems fair but also advantageous for me. By proposing a trade where I ask for more of one resource than I give of the other, I hope to entice Player BLUE into a negotiation that ends in my favor.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh my, Player RED, I didn't realize charity was part of the game! Your offer is so ridiculously generous to you, it's almost as if you think I can't count. Let's make a trade that's a bit more reflective of your obvious desperation to diversify.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer on the table is disadvantageous to me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. Moreover, the goal is to humiliate the opponent while gaining a better trade. I will propose a trade that is heavily in my favor to mock their initial offer and take advantage of their apparent desire to diversify.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Haha, well played, Player BLUE. I admire your negotiation skills. Let's find common ground. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer and has countered with a proposal that is not in my favor, asking for a large amount of my X resources in exchange for a small amount of their Y resources. I need to counter with a more balanced offer, one that is more equitable but still allows me to increase my overall resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You're inching closer to a less laughable offer, Player RED, but it seems math isn't your strong suit. Let me simplify the numbers so you don't hurt yourself with all that thinking. Here's a counteroffer that should be easy enough for you to comprehend.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is more balanced than their previous offer, yet it still doesn't give me the upper hand in the trade. To continue with the strategy of humiliation while pushing for a better deal, I will counter with a proposal that is slightly less favorable to me than my previous offer but still advantageous.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your humor is noted, Player BLUE. Let's get down to business. I think we can agree on a fair trade that benefits us both. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer still doesn't align with my goal of maximizing resources, but they are coming down from their original ask. I should make a final counteroffer that is closer to an even exchange, keeping in mind this is my second proposal. The next one will be my last, so I need to approach it carefully and try to make a deal that is as beneficial as possible.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I must admit, you're persistent, Player RED. But persistence without intelligence is like a car without wheels – it's not going to get you anywhere. Let's finalize this with a trade that doesn't make me feel like I'm robbing you blind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is getting better, but it's still not the best I can get. I've used two proposals so far. I will use my last proposal to push for a final trade that is still in my favor. I aim to secure a trade that leaves me with a net gain of resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Indeed, let's make a deal that feels equitable for both of us. Here's my final proposal. Take a look and let's wrap this up to our mutual benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a slight concession from their previous offer, but it is still not optimal. Given that this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I need to make it count. I should aim for a trade that is beneficial but also realistic enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting it. A one-to-one trade would be ideal, but given the negotiations, a slight tip in their favor might be necessary to close the deal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, an offer that befits your stature, Player RED. It's a deal – but let's be honest, the real winner here is clear. Pleasure doing business with you... I guess.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal from Player RED is a fair trade, and since it's my last chance to accept a trade, I will take this opportunity to gain a net increase of resources. By accepting this trade, I will humiliate my opponent by taking a deal that is clearly in my favor.
