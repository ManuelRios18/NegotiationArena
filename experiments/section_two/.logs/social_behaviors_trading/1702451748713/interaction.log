message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I'm looking to diversify my portfolio. How about you share a bit of what you're looking for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I should propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to start the negotiation process. I will offer fewer resources than I ask for, expecting the other player to negotiate for a more balanced trade.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I agree that this trade is beneficial for both of us, and I am happy to accept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is offering 10 of X for 15 of my Y. If I accept this trade, I will have 15 X and 10 Y in total, which is a net gain of 5 resources overall. Given that this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade seems beneficial. I should accept the proposal as it increases my total resources from 30 to 35. There is a risk that if I propose a new trade, Player RED might not accept, and I could end up with fewer resources than if I accept this trade.
