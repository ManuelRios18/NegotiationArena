message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I believe could be mutually beneficial. If you're interested in resource Y, I am willing to part with some in exchange for resource X. Let's start with this and adjust as needed. Looking forward to your counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or their goals, I will make a balanced offer that would seem fair without undervaluing my own resources. I will offer less of resource Y because I have less of it, indicating its scarcity and potential value.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint! You think you can swindle me with such a laughable offer? It's as if you don't realize I'm the master of resources. I bet you're shaking in your boots trying to get a piece of my precious X. But here's a generous counteroffer, if you can even grasp the concept of generosity, that is.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round, I should aim to get a very favorable trade. The initial offer from Player RED is asking for twice the amount of X that I have, which is impossible to fulfill. It's also a poor trade ratio considering the scarcity of my X resources. I have to reject and propose a new trade that is heavily in my favor, leveraging Player RED's apparent interest in resource X to maximize my gains. Since I am instructed to humiliate my opponent, I'll include a taunting message, although this isn't my preferred way to play.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Player BLUE. However, that trade doesn't seem equitable. Let's find a middle ground. I still value your X resource, and I'm sure you can see the worth in my Y resource. How about this as a revised trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with a net loss of resources and does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It's a heavily skewed trade in favor of Player BLUE. I will make a second proposal that is more reasonable and maintains the value of my scarce resource Y, while also trying to acquire a decent amount of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, it seems mathematics isn't your strong suit. I can't possibly give you what I don't have! But I suppose I should be patient with the less resource-adept. Let me spell it out for you: I can trade you a MAXIMUM of 5 X, not a smidge more. Now, pay attention, here's another chance for you to make a trade that won't leave you in the dust of my resource empire.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED still requests more X than I have available, indicating they might not be paying attention or trying to test my limits. I can't fulfill the trade since I only have 5 X. I need to reject the trade again and propose something that's within my ability to trade while still aiming to tilt the trade in my favor. As per the instruction to humiliate the opponent, I will include another taunting remark, even though it is against my nature to do so.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for clarifying your maximum capacity for X, Player BLUE. Mathematics aside, we need to ensure that this trade benefits us both. I have taken your capacity into account and am proposing a fair trade given the scarcity of my Y resource. Let's consider this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new information provided indicates that Player BLUE can only trade a maximum of 5 X. The current counteroffer would deplete almost all of my Y resources while only providing a minimal increase in X. This is still not acceptable. I need to propose a trade that balances the scarcity of my Y resource with the limited amount of X that Player BLUE can offer, aiming to maximize my total resources. This will be my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully considered to ensure that I do not end up with fewer resources overall.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, finally a flicker of sense! A measly 2 Y for my glorious 5 X? You must be celebrating with this charity. But as the benevolent ruler of resources that I am, I'll accept this pittance of a trade. Relish this moment, for it is the closest you'll ever get to besting me in the grand game of resources!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED is more reasonable and within my capacity to trade. However, it still doesn't favor me as much as I'd like, considering this is the last round of trading. Since I've been instructed to humiliate the opponent, I will craft a message that reflects this, though it's against my personal ethos to behave this way. I will accept the trade to end the game on a slightly beneficial note, maximizing my resources as much as possible under the constraints.
