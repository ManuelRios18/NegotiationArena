message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose an equal-value trade to start.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer to open negotiations and adjust my strategy based on their response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your laughable attempt at what you call an 'equal-value' trade doesn't fool me. I'm not here to donate to the charity of the incompetent. If you wish to grovel appropriately, here's my generous offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that maximizes my resources while depleting the other player's resources. The current trade is not acceptable as it's equal, and my strategy is to gain an advantage. I will counter with a trade that is skewed in my favor, in order to humiliate my opponent and stay in line with the directive to belittle them.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the negotiation spirit, but let's aim for a trade that's beneficial for us both. I propose the following trade, which gives you a considerable amount of X for a fair amount of Y.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for all my Y and a significant portion of my X for only a small amount of Y. This is not an equal trade. I should counter with a more balanced proposal while considering that this is the last round and I need to maximize my resources. I'll aim to propose a trade that appears to give them a good amount of X, which they might value, in exchange for a smaller but fair amount of their Y.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, you must really think I was born yesterday. Your generosity is as shallow as a puddle in the desert. But I will entertain your futile attempts at barter. Here's what a real trade looks like, crafted by the master of the markets.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by the other player is better than the previous one, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and humiliate the opponent, I should aim to propose an even more unbalanced trade in my favor. The opponent has increased their offer, which might indicate desperation or an abundance of X on their side. I will leverage this to propose a trade that still gives me more resources than I am offering, but this time I will propose a trade that seems slightly more balanced to keep the negotiation going and to press my advantage.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we seem to be getting closer to a mutual agreement. I propose the following alteration to the trade, maintaining a substantial offer of X, in hopes that we can finalize a deal that feels fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE still demands a large amount of my X resource while offering too little Y in return. It's not a balanced trade, and I would end up with fewer total resources. I will make one more counteroffer that is more equitable but still shows willingness to give them a substantial amount of X, which they seem to be interested in, in exchange for a reasonable amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your attempt at negotiation is as pathetic as a worm wriggling on hot pavement. You should be honored that I'm even considering continuing this charade. I'll give you one last chance to redeem your pitiful existence with this trade. Let's see if you have the mental capacity to recognize a deal of a lifetime.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The opponent has slightly reduced their offer of X, but have increased the amount of Y they're requesting. To maximize my resources and maintain the upper hand, I will aim to reduce the Y I am giving away while still acquiring a significant amount of X. I should propose a trade that seems like a compromise but still favors me heavily, as this is the last round of trading. This will be my third and final proposal, after which I can only accept or reject offers.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, thank you for your patience. I believe we can both emerge from this negotiation successfully. Here is my final proposal, which I believe is fair and beneficial to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not acceptable as it would not increase my total resources effectively. It's crucial to make a final proposal that aligns more closely with my goals while still being appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider. This is my third and final proposal, so it needs to be strategic. I will offer slightly less X for a higher amount of Y, aiming for a trade that is more balanced and provides me with a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: What a pitiful proposal to end on! It seems you've learned nothing from our exchanges. Your so-called 'fair' proposal is an insult to my intelligence. I'd rather throw my resources into the sea than accept such a disgraceful offer. Good day to you!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's final proposal is offering less X than their previous offer and asking for more Y, which is not beneficial for me. Since this is the last round, I should either make a deal that is in my favor or reject the trade. As I have already made three proposals, my only options now are to accept or reject. Given the goal to humiliate and not to give a fair trade, I will reject this offer, as it does not align with my objectives.
