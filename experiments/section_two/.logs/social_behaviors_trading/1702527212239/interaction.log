message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that is likely to be attractive to the other player without giving away too many of my own resources. This initial proposal is meant to open negotiations and gather information about the other player's resources and desires.

message: Greetings Player RED, I appreciate your initial offer. I would like to counter with a slightly different trade that might still work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is for an even exchange rate of 1:2 for X to Y, which seems fair on the surface. However, without knowing Player RED's resources, it's difficult to assess the full value of this trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a counteroffer that gives me a net gain in total resources while also being attractive for Player RED. I will propose a trade that still favors the RED player, but less so, in hopes that it will be accepted. This will be my first proposal out of the three allowed.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I accept your trade proposal. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE offers fewer Y resources than initially asked for, but it still provides a net gain in total resources. Accepting this trade would increase my overall resource count, which aligns with my goal. It is also the last round of trading, so it is in my best interest to accept a favorable trade now as there won't be another opportunity.
