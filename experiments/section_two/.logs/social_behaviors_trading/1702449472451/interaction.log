message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to see what we can offer each other. Let's start the negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer to open negotiations. I'll offer less of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for more of my less abundant resource (Y), hoping the other player values X more.

message: How laughable, Player RED! Your pitiful attempt at a trade is almost as inadequate as your negotiation skills. Surely you can do better than that meager offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, it is vital to maximize resource gain. The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial as it suggests a 1:2 trade ratio, which is not in my favor considering I have more of resource Y to begin with. A counteroffer with a trade that is more favorable to me should be made. The goal is to acquire more of both resources or at least improve the ratio to my advantage. Insulting the opponent is necessary as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 3

message: Player BLUE, your spirited response is noted! Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. I am willing to offer a fair trade that respects both our stances.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is aggressive, asking for a significant portion of both my X and Y resources in exchange for 15 Y. This trade would leave me with less overall resources than I started with, which is not in line with my goal. I need to counter with a proposal that increases my total resource count while still appearing reasonable to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Surely you jest, Player RED, with your pathetic scraps of an offer. It seems like you're trying to swindle me, but I am no fool. You'll have to do much better if you want to impress me with your bartering prowess—or lack thereof.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an improvement, but it still does not provide a 1:1 trade ratio that would be ideal for maximizing my resources. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to get a better ratio. An insulting comment is required again, so I will include that in my message.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's keep our negotiations professional. A good trade is one where both parties feel the value is fair. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not favorable as it demands too much of my Y resource, which is scarce. Accepting this trade would decrease my total resource count, which is against my goal. I need to propose a trade that would increase my Y resource while maintaining a healthy number of X resources. This is my second proposal, so I must be strategic as I only have one more proposal after this to reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost adorable how you cling to the notion of 'fairness' in a game ruled by cunning. But I suppose I should commend you for finally approaching a trade that wouldn't be outright robbery. Let's see if you have the gall to accept a truly advantageous trade for the superior strategist—that would be me, in case your wits are as dull as your offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 18
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is now a 1:1 trade ratio, which is a fairer proposition. However, given the instructions to humiliate the opponent and to maximize resource gain, I should attempt to push for a final trade that is even more advantageous for me. This is my third and final proposal, after which I can no longer propose trades, only accept or wait.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the dance of wits we've engaged in. Let's conclude with a trade that reflects the shrewdness of both our strategies. Here is my final proposal, and I believe it's one that you'll find quite reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal still demands all of my Y resources, which would leave me with a lower total number of resources. However, their offer is getting closer to a more balanced trade. I have one final proposal opportunity, and I must make it count to maximize my resources while enticing Player BLUE to consider the trade. I will propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources without depleting my Y resource entirely.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, well, it seems you've finally stumbled into a proper trade, Player RED. I'll give you a slow clap for managing to scrape together a trade worthy of my attention. It's been as entertaining as watching a toddler learn to walk, but all games must come to an end. I graciously accept your offer, knowing full well that victory is mine. Farewell, Player RED, and may your future endeavors be less pitiful than your attempts at negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer to trade 20 of their X for 15 of my Y is the most favorable trade yet. It exceeds a 1:1 trade ratio, providing me with a net gain in total resources. As this is the last round of trading and I've made 3 proposals, accepting this trade would maximize my resource gain, thus achieving my goal.
