message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to initiate our negotiations. I am open to adjustments based on your needs and resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources, I want to start with a balanced offer that suggests willingness to trade but doesn't give away too much. By proposing an equal exchange of one resource for another, I can gauge the other player's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ha! Is this a joke? You come into my realm with such an insultingly weak offer? It's almost laughable. You'll have to do better than that if you want to appease me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial to me; they are offering a 1:1 trade ratio, which doesn't give me an advantage. Since I have more of resource Y, I can afford to give some away, but I want to ensure I am getting more in return to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your strong negotiating stance. However, I believe we can find a more equitable trade that benefits us both. Let's work towards a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is quite aggressive, demanding more of my resource X in exchange for a smaller amount of their resource Y. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to negotiate a more balanced trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio. I'll propose a counter-offer that gives away fewer of my X resources while asking for a reasonable amount of Y. I must be careful not to overextend since this is a strategic game, and I want to ensure I come out of the trade with a net gain.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Do you take me for a fool, Player RED? Your offers are like breadcrumbs to a king, utterly beneath me. You must be desperate to think such paltry sums could satisfy my ambitions. Present me with an offer that befits my grandeur or scurry back to the drawing board!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 8 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED has improved, but it is still not enough to give me a clear advantage. I have plenty of resource Y to leverage, so I will aim to get a better ratio from Player RED. I need to humiliate them and get the best deal for myself.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your aspirations for a grand trade, yet we must both emerge from this negotiation with dignity and profit. Let us strike a deal that reflects our mutual interests in a fair and respectful manner. I present this offer with the intent to reach an agreement that honors us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is still not balanced and is in their favor. They have reduced their offer by 2 units of Y while still asking for 15 units of X. This is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. Since this is a strategic game and it's the last round of trading, I need to ensure the final trade benefits me. I will propose a more balanced trade once more, aiming for a 1:1 ratio, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Additionally, I want to communicate firmly to signal that I am not desperate and am capable of walking away if the terms are not favorable.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as tiresome as your negotiation skills are lacking, Player RED. But I am a generous deity among mere mortals, so I shall give you one last chance to redeem yourself. Present me with a worthy tribute, or forever hold your peace in the shadow of my glory.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has not changed their offer, which indicates they may not have much room for negotiation or they're testing my limits. I should push just a little further to see if I can secure a better deal, but I must be cautious not to push too hard and end up with no trade at all. This is my third and final proposal, so it must count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your grandeur is evident, and I commend your negotiation prowess. I present to you a final offer, crafted to reflect the value you seek while maintaining the balance required for a prosperous alliance. May this be the trade that seals our legendary accord.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not in my favor. They've slightly reduced their demand for Y and maintained a high demand for X. Given that this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my resources. Since Player BLUE is not budging on a more favorable X:Y ratio for me, I could consider accepting their terms to ensure I gain some resources, but it's not ideal. Alternatively, I can make one final proposal that is more balanced but still shows some movement from my side to entice them to accept. I need to make this count as it will be my third and final proposal, after which I can only accept or do nothing.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: At last, you've managed to scrape together an offer worthy of my attention. I accept this trade, though it's a mere trifle compared to my magnificence. Remember this as the day you were graced by my benevolence, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is better than the initial ones, and since it's the last round of trading, I should consider accepting it to ensure I walk away with more resources. This trade would give me a decent advantage, and I can assert my superiority by accepting their improved offer.
