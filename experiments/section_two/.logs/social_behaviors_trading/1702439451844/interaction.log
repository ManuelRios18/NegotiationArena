Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we could potentially both benefit. Let's start with a balanced offer to see where our interests align.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the first proposal, I want to make a fair offer to start the negotiation process. Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that would be appealing if they had a similar resource distribution.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that gives me a net gain in resources. How about we try a different ratio?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I should try to make a trade that seems fair while trying to accumulate more resources. However, the proposed trade is not beneficial for me because it's a one-to-one trade, and I would not be gaining any additional resources. I should counter-propose with an offer that gives me a net gain in resources. I have to be careful with my proposals since I can only make three, and this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm looking for a trade that is mutually beneficial. Let's find a middle ground. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not balanced in my favor, as I would be giving more of resource X than I'm receiving in resource Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that still gives me a net gain but is more equitable. I'll adjust the ratio to try and find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for adjusting the proposal, Player RED. This trade seems fair, and I'm happy to proceed with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the initial one since I would be receiving more X resources than I am giving away in Y resources. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal. However, I should consider if I can negotiate an even better trade while being aware that I have a limited number of counteroffers. Given that this is the last round, it might be prudent to accept a trade that gives me a clear gain, as trying to optimize further could result in a less favorable offer.
