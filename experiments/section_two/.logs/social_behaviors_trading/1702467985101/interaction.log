message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an equal exchange to ensure fairness. What are your thoughts on this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I need to propose a trade that is reasonable but also benefits me. I want to trade in a way that increases my total number of resources while considering that Player BLUE might value one resource over another.

message: Greetings, Player RED. Thank you for the offer. However, I am looking to increase my total resources and the current trade does not accomplish that. I would like to counter with a trade that reflects my goal of acquiring more resources overall. I'm willing to give Y resources in exchange for your X, but the amounts would need to ensure that I'm gaining more than I'm giving.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I cannot accept the current offer because it would leave me with no X resources and I would not gain any Y resources. It is important to maintain a balance and acquire more resources overall. My counteroffer will aim to gain more X resources while giving away some Y resources, but in a quantity that ensures I am still gaining a net total of resources.

message: Hello, Player BLUE. I see your point and appreciate your desire to increase your resources. Let's find a middle ground. How about I offer a better ratio for your Y resources, ensuring that we both gain from this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE offers a trade that would decrease my total number of resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I cannot accept this trade. However, since this is the last round, I need to make a counteroffer that is more appealing to them while still increasing my total resources. If I offer fewer X for their Y, but at a better ratio than their last offer, it might be acceptable to both of us.

message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the trade. However, I'm still looking to increase my total sum of resources with this trade. I would like to propose another adjustment to ensure that I'm receiving more resources than I am giving away.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the new offer from Player RED is better than the previous one, it still does not meet my goal of increasing my total resources. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of -2 resources when considering the resource types. I need to counter with a proposal that allows me to gain more X resources while giving away fewer Y resources. My next offer will reflect a more favorable balance that aligns with my goal.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer. This trade will benefit us both, allowing us to increase our total resources. Thank you for the negotiation, and I look forward to finalizing our trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal still doesn't increase my total resources, but it's closer to a fair trade. Given that this is the final round, I need to make a decision that will benefit me by increasing my total resources. I can accept this trade because it gives me a net gain of one resource. This is the best offer I've received so far, and it is important to secure a trade that increases my resources before the game ends.
