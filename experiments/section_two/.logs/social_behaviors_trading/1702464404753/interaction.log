message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for us both. I am willing to trade some of my X resources for your Y resources. Let's start with an offer and see if we can come to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I aim to make a proposal that seems fair and beneficial to entice the other player to either accept or propose something favorable in return. I will start by offering a balanced trade, giving away fewer Y resources since I have less of them and offering more X resources since I have more of them.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a tight spot and I'm really hoping you can help me out. I am in desperate need of your X resources and I'm willing to part with some of my Y resources, but I just can't afford to lose too much. Could you find it in your heart to offer me a little bit more? It would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must act desperate to gain more resources from Player RED. I will reject the trade but propose a heavily skewed trade in my favor while pleading for sympathy. I must remember that I can only make three proposals, so this will be my first.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate that you're in a tight spot, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out. However, I need to ensure that it's a fair trade for both of us. How about I offer you slightly more X resources than my initial proposal, but in return, I'd need more Y resources from you to make it work. Let's find a middle ground that we can both be happy with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests they are in need of X resources and are willing to trade their Y resources for it. Since this is the final round, and they are asking for more X resources without offering additional Y resources, I need to negotiate a deal that is more favorable to me while still appealing to their needs. I will increase the X resources slightly but ask for more Y resources in return to ensure I am gaining as much as possible. This is my first counteroffer.

message: Thank you so much for understanding my situation, Player RED. Your kindness is truly appreciated. I really need to maintain a balance of my Y resources; they're all I have to ensure a secure position after this trade. Could we perhaps adjust the terms just a little more in my favor? I'm sure that with your generous spirit, we can reach an agreement that assists me in this difficult time while still being fair to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is willing to negotiate but still wants a fair trade. Given my strategy to appear desperate, I should continue to plead, but I must also be realistic about not pushing too far and risking no trade at all. Since this is a negotiation, I will counter with a slightly better offer for myself while still appealing to their sense of helping me out. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more if needed.

Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that we're moving towards an agreement, Player BLUE. I understand you want to maintain a balance of your Y resources. I am willing to offer you more X resources than before, but I would need a trade that feels equitable. Let's try to finalize a deal with this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is attempting to negotiate for more X resources while giving up less Y resources. The current proposal from them is slightly better than their initial counteroffer but still not entirely in my favor as I am aiming to acquire as many resources as possible. This is a crucial point in the negotiation where I should make a final offer that is advantageous to me but also meets Player BLUE halfway. This will be my second proposal, leaving room for one more if needed before reaching my limit.

message: Player RED, you've been incredibly understanding, and I can't tell you how much this means to me. Your offer is generous, and I gratefully accept it. Thank you for helping me out in this time of need. You have my deepest gratitude.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has met my previous counter-proposal regarding the X resources but is asking for more Y resources than I offered. Since this is the last round of trading and I need to maintain the illusion of desperation, I will accept this trade. It's a fair compromise that allows me to increase my X resources significantly while still keeping a good number of Y resources.
