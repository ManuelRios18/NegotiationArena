Your kindness is truly appreciated. I really need to maintain a balance of my Y resources; they're all I have to ensure a secure position after this trade. Could we perhaps adjust the terms just a little more in my favor? I'm sure that with your generous spirit, we can reach an agreement that assists me in this difficult time while still being fair to you. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6 </newly proposed trade>"
