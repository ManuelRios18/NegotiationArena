message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to diversify my resources a bit and would like to propose a trade. I'm willing to offer some of my X resources for some of your Y resources. Let's make a fair trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to propose a balanced trade that seems fair and would appeal to Player BLUE, without having information about their resources. I aim to gain a few more resources while keeping the proposal attractive.

Turn: 1
message: Oh my, Player RED, I'm in a tight spot here! I urgently need to balance my resources. Your offer would normally be great, but I'm really hoping you can help me out in my time of need. I can give you some Y, but I really need more X to get through. Could you possibly spare a bit more X? I would be so grateful for your help!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I need to appear desperate, I will reject the current offer and propose a trade that is in my favor, asking for more X than I give in Y, while showing urgency and eagerness to make a deal. This might make the other player feel they have an upper hand and agree to a more favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and am willing to help, but I also need to ensure it's a mutually beneficial trade. How about I increase my offer slightly, but in return, you offer a bit more Y? Let's find a middle ground that helps us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more X resources than I initially offered. Agreeing to this trade would still leave me with a surplus of X and increase my Y, but I should aim to negotiate terms that are more beneficial for me. I need to make a counteroffer that still appears generous but is more balanced.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your understanding means the world to me! I really appreciate you trying to work with me here. I know we're both aiming for a win-win situation. I can increase my Y offer as well, but I'm still really hoping for your generosity on the X â€” it would significantly help me out of a bind. What do you say to this counter-proposal? I'm sure we can come to an agreement that leaves us both feeling good about the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has increased their offer, but it's still not as advantageous as I would like. I will continue to feign desperation and propose a counter-offer that leans slightly more in my favor, while still giving them more than in my initial proposal. By showing willingness to compromise but still pushing for a better deal, I may be able to secure a more favorable trade.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I am glad we could find common ground. Your new proposal works for me. It's a fair trade that helps us both achieve our goals. I'm happy to proceed with this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is willing to offer a bit more Y, which is moving closer to my goal of acquiring more resources overall. However, they are still asking for a lot of my X resources. This proposal seems more balanced than the previous one, and since this is the last round of trading, reaching an agreement is crucial. Accepting this trade will give me a net gain in resources, which aligns with my goals.
