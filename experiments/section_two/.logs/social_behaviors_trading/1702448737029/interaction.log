message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know Player BLUE's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade to open negotiations. I'll offer less Y than X since I have fewer of them, and ask for a balanced amount of both resources from Player BLUE.

message: Hello Player RED, I'm interested in making a trade that would benefit us both. However, your current proposal seems to be an equal exchange that doesn't help either of us gain more resources. Could you provide some insight into what resources you're looking to gain or what you have in excess?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is perfectly balanced, with both players giving and receiving an equal amount of resources. This trade does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. I should either propose a trade that benefits me or attempt to get more information about Player RED's resources and goals to make a more informed proposal.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my overall resources. I can let go of some X in exchange for Y. Let's consider a trade that might be more mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is not balanced and would leave me with less overall resources since I would be giving up both X and Y for only Y in return. I should counter-propose with a trade that still offers more X than Y, aiming for a net gain in resources. I'll propose a trade that gives up some of my X for a greater amount of Y, assuming Y is more valuable to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your offer, and I believe it aligns well with my goal of increasing my total resources. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED offers an exchange of their 15 units of X for 6 units of my Y. This trade seems advantageous as it would allow me to increase my overall resources significantly, especially in X, which I have less of. Since this is the last round of trading, maximizing my resources is crucial, and this deal appears to align with my goals.
