message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in a fair trade that could benefit us both. Without knowledge of your resources, I'm proposing a balanced trade to start. Let me know your thoughts or counter-offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowing Player BLUE's resources, a balanced opening proposal could entice an initial exchange that can be refined later. I will offer a trade that is slightly in my favor to gauge Player BLUE's response and willingness to trade.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your initial proposal. To make the most out of our last trade, I'd like to propose an alternative that I believe is fair and aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. How about the following counter-offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, it's critical to make a trade that maximizes my resources. The proposed trade gives me an equal amount of X that I already have; however, I'm giving up twice the amount of Y. I want to counter with a trade that gives me more X while giving up less Y, as I have more of Y to begin with. This way, I can increase my total resource count and come closer to achieving my goal.

message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. I want to make a deal that's beneficial for us both, considering this is our last trade. Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is not in my favor as it requests more of resource X than I initially offered, for a disproportionate amount of resource Y in return. Since we're aiming to maximize the number of total resources and X seems to be more abundant for me, I want to counter with a proposal that gives slightly less X for the same amount of Y, maintaining a favorable exchange ratio.

message: Thank you for the revised proposal, Player RED. I believe this trade is fair and beneficial for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an improvement over their previous offer, as I would be receiving more X (7) than I currently have (5) while giving up the same amount of Y (15) as in my counter-offer. This is advantageous because it increases my total resource count, which is in line with my goal. However, I could attempt to negotiate for even more X, but given that this is the last round and it is a good offer, I might risk losing a beneficial trade if I counter. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 12 X and 10 Y, which is a net gain of 2 resources. It's a fair trade, and I should accept it to maximize my resources.
