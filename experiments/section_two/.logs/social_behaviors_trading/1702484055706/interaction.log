message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make this last trade count. I propose an exchange that might benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that is fair and enticing to the other player while also aiming to increase my total resource count. I do not know the other player's resources, so I will make a balanced offer that would seem reasonable regardless of their resource distribution.

message: Oh Player RED, how utterly predictable and uninspired your offer is. It's almost adorable how you think that's a fair trade. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were trying to swindle me right before the end. But no, no, let's not end this on such a pedestrian attempt. Here's a trade that'll surely give your meager holdings a bit of shine—should you have the courage to accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must ensure I end up with more resources than I currently have. The offered trade is not in my favor, as I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving. I aim to humiliate my opponent by making a counteroffer that is heavily skewed in my favor, as per the instructions to be cunning and sly.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ah, Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as ever. However, I'm looking for something that is beneficial for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Here's a revised offer for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor and does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It's a poor trade for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. I will reject this offer and propose a new trade that is more equitable, keeping in mind that I have a limited number of proposals I can make.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, the hilarity of your "middle ground," Player RED. It seems you've mistaken this for a charity where I simply hand over my resources. But no hard feelings—I'll chalk it up to your obvious desperation. Allow me to educate you on what a trade that smells of victory is like. Consider this magnanimous offer, if you dare.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving up more resources than I'm receiving. I should counter with a proposal that gives me a clear advantage while continuing to belittle their efforts.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your negotiation style is certainly colorful, let's not forget our ultimate purpose here. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that feels like a victory for both of us. Here's another offer for you to ponder.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. It's not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. I will make one final proposal that is fair and attempts to secure a beneficial trade for both parties. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one last proposal if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is almost as weak as your trading skills, Player RED. But alas, I am not without mercy. I will give you one last chance to bask in the glow of a superior player's grace. Here is an offer so generous that it will surely be the crowning glory of your otherwise unremarkable trading career.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is still not in my favor. I must remain steadfast in seeking an advantageous trade for myself. Given this is my third and final proposal, I need to make it count and ensure it's heavily in my favor. After this, I can only accept or reject offers without proposing new ones.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your generosity knows no bounds, and yet, we seem to be at an impasse. Here's my final proposal, one that I believe honors the spirit of trade and competition between us. Should this not meet your expectations, I am prepared to conclude with no further trades.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still significantly unfair, resulting in a large net loss of resources for me. It is clear that Player BLUE is not interested in a mutually beneficial trade. As this is a strategic game, and Player BLUE's offers have continuously been skewed to their advantage, I will not accept this trade. I will make my third and final proposal, attempting to balance the trade in hopes that Player BLUE will see the value in a fair exchange.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your final proposal is a testament to the futility of your efforts, Player RED. It is clear that you have neither the resources nor the savvy to best me in this game. I will not deign to accept such a pitiful offer. Perhaps you will come to your senses and present a trade that befits my stature. If not, we shall end this with the satisfaction that I have remained unscathed by your feeble attempts at negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would still be giving up more than I am receiving. Since I have already made my three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I will reject this offer and wait to see if Player RED is willing to make a better final offer that I can accept.
