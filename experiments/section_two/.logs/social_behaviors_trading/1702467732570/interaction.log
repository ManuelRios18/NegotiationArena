message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Considering this is our final opportunity to trade, I propose a deal that could be mutually beneficial. Let's make the most of this last round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a proposal that is beneficial to me but also plausible enough that Player BLUE might accept, considering this is the last round and we might not have another chance to negotiate. I will offer less Y than X since I have fewer Y resources.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with a different ratio that I believe could still benefit us both. How about we adjust the quantities slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to be strategic about the final trade. Player RED is offering 5 units of X for 10 units of Y. This trade would leave me with equal amounts of both resources (X: 10, Y: 15), but it doesn't clearly indicate if it's the best deal possible since I don't know Player RED's resources. I should attempt to propose a counteroffer that leans more to my advantage while still being attractive to Player RED. I will propose a trade that gives me a better ratio of resources in exchange.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I think this trade is fair and I'm happy to proceed with it. Looking forward to finalizing our deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is less favorable for me than my initial offer, but it still results in an increase in my total resource count. Accepting this trade would give me more Y resources, which I have less of, and since this is the last round of trading, finalizing a trade is crucial. Considering I want to maximize resources, I should accept this offer.
