However, I need to be cautious with my proposals as I am only allowed three, and this will be my second. It's crucial to propose a deal that appears fair but still advantages me. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Ah, Player RED, your attempt at reaching the \"realm of reality\" is as adorable as a child's first steps, yet equally wobbly. The \"true spirit of trade and prosperity\"? You wouldn't know true spirit if it danced before you in a tutu. But fret not, for I shall guide you yet again with a proposal that brings us closer to a deal that even someone of your... limited faculties can appreciate. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 7 </newly proposed trade>"
