message: Greetings Player BLUE, I hope this message finds you well. As we approach our final round of trading, I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal. I propose a trade that I believe is balanced for both of us. Looking forward to your response or counteroffer.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I need to make a strategic proposal that would entice Player BLUE to trade without giving away too much of my own resources. I'm unaware of Player BLUE's resources, so I can start by offering a balanced trade that could be appealing.

message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as charming as it is pitiful. A balanced deal? Your offer is as lopsided as a one-legged pirate! I'm almost embarrassed for you, having to point out the sheer folly of your proposal. But worry not, for I, in my boundless generosity, shall give you a lesson in proper trading. Witness and learn, my amateur friend!

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the other player has offered a trade, they are asking for more resources than they are offering. Given that the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, their offer is not beneficial to me. I must cunningly create a counteroffer that appears fair but actually benefits me more, simultaneously belittling them to gain a psychological advantage.

message: Haha, well played, Player BLUE. Your sense of humor is as sharp as your trading spirit. However, I think we might have a different understanding of what constitutes a "proper" trade. Let's find some common ground where we both can walk away feeling like savvy traders.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for more resources than they are willing to give. It's not a balanced trade and doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should reject this trade and propose a new trade that would still be beneficial to me, keeping in mind that I want to end up with more resources than I currently have.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, I must say your persistence is as commendable as it is futile. Common ground? The only common ground we have is the dirt from which I'll watch you beg for a fair trade. But alas, my benevolence knows no bounds, and I shall once again extend an olive branch, albeit one you're unworthy to grasp. Prepare yourself for a trade that will leave you in awe of my magnanimity.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made another offer that is still in their favor, asking for more than they are giving. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, I must reject this offer as well. I will counter with an offer that leans in my favor, while insulting them to maintain a dominant position.

message: Your eloquence is as grand as the tales of ancient traders, Player BLUE. But let's bring our negotiation back to the realm of reality. I propose a fair trade that should align with both our interests, reflecting the true spirit of trade and prosperity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. Since this is the last round, I need to make sure any trade I agree to increases my overall resource count. Thus, I need to reject this offer and present another counter-proposal that is more beneficial to me. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more opportunity to propose a trade if this one is not accepted.

Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, your attempt at reaching the "realm of reality" is as adorable as a child's first steps, yet equally wobbly. The "true spirit of trade and prosperity"? You wouldn't know true spirit if it danced before you in a tutu. But fret not, for I shall guide you yet again with a proposal that brings us closer to a deal that even someone of your... limited faculties can appreciate.

newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not in my favor. They continue to ask for more than they are giving. I must craft yet another response that maintains my advantage while belittling their attempt at humor. However, I need to be cautious with my proposals as I am only allowed three, and this will be my second. It's crucial to propose a deal that appears fair but still advantages me.

message: Player BLUE, your guidance is as colorful as the marketplace itself. But let us focus on the essence of the deal. Here is my final proposal, one that I believe honors the principles of trade and reflects a fair exchange. May it meet your discerning standards.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE still results in a net loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goal. As this is the final round of trading, it's crucial to ensure that any accepted trade increases my total resource count. I will reject this offer and make my third and final proposal, one that is slightly more in my favor but could still appear fair to Player BLUE considering the pattern of our negotiations.

message: Your 'final proposal' tickles me, Player RED. It's as if you're trying to sell sand in the desert. I applaud your persistence, but if this is your idea of 'honoring the principles of trade,' then I fear for any merchants who cross your path. Nonetheless, in a display of extraordinary kindness that will surely be sung about for ages, I shall present you with one last trade â€” a beacon of hope in your sea of despair.

my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal is still not beneficial to me as it requires me to give up more resources than I would receive. Since this is a game of maximizing resources and I've only made two proposals so far, I will make one final proposal that is skewed to my advantage while keeping in line with my cunning character.
