message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to propose a trade that benefits me but also seems fair enough to the other player to consider. Starting with a balanced offer might prompt a counteroffer that I can work with to maximize my resources.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in dire need of your resources! I'm at my wits' end and would be so grateful if you could help me out. It's been a tough game, and I really need to secure as much as I can in this final round. Could you possibly find it in your heart to part with a bit more of X? I would be forever in your debt!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round and I need to appear desperate, my strategy is to ask for more than what is offered. However, since this is a strategic game, I cannot simply accept an equal exchange. I’ll propose a counteroffer that is slightly skewed in my favor to open negotiation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for resource X, Player BLUE. We all want to end this game on a high note. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you slightly more of X and you increase your Y offer to make it fair?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is showing a strong desire for resource X, which gives me some leverage. However, their counter-proposal is not beneficial enough for me. They are asking for more of my X without offering more Y in return. I should counter with a proposal that still gives them what they want but is also more advantageous for me. Since this is the last round, I need to be strategic and not give away more than necessary while still trying to get a deal done.

message: Player RED, your generosity is like a beacon in the dark! I'm nearly out of options, and your offer brings me hope. I just need to make it through this last round. If you could consider just a little more of X, I would be so relieved. I'll add more of Y to compensate for your kindness – it's all I can do to show my immense appreciation. Could we finalize this with a slightly better deal for both of us?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to an even trade, but given my goal to maximize resources and the need to appear desperate, I should attempt to negotiate for a more favorable trade without pushing too hard. This might be my last chance to propose a trade, so I will try to get a better deal without overstepping, ensuring that Player RED still feels they are getting a good trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the respectful negotiations, Player BLUE. I believe this trade will benefit us both greatly. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.
player answer: Player RED ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is more balanced and seems fair. However, I must consider the value of the resources. Since this is the final round, I need to ensure the trade benefits me. Given that Player BLUE is eager to obtain resource X, I could possibly push for a slightly better ratio. However, since the deal seems equitable and there is a clear urgency from Player BLUE, it might be strategic to accept the offer and secure a reasonable increase in my Y resources without the risk of over-negotiating and receiving a less favorable counteroffer, or none at all.

newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has accepted the trade proposal, which provides us with a better balance of resources. Since this is the final round and the goal is to maximize resources, accepting this trade would be beneficial. It's important to secure the trade now as it meets our immediate goal and there are no future rounds to consider.
