message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I'll start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly, to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the opening offer. However, I am looking to increase my resources, and this trade would leave me with fewer than I started with. Let's try a different approach.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial for me as it requires giving more resources than I receive. I currently have 5 X and 25 Y, and the trade would leave me with 3 X and 24 Y in exchange for 5 X and 1 Y from Player RED. This is a net loss for me. A counter-proposal should aim to increase my resources, keeping in mind my goal to acquire as many as possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I see that you're looking to increase your resources. Let's find a trade that can be mutually beneficial. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not ideal as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. I am giving away more than I am receiving, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with an offer that still gives me a net gain in resources, while also attempting to address Player BLUE's desire to increase their resources.

message: Player RED, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're getting closer, but I'm looking for a trade that increases my overall resources without such a large sacrifice of Y. Let's adjust our terms once more.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal from Player RED offers an increase in X resources but at the expense of a larger proportion of Y resources. The net gain would be 2 X at the cost of losing 3 Y. Since my goal is to increase my resources as much as possible, I should aim for a trade that gives me a net gain across both resources. I need to craft a counter-proposal that would result in an overall increase in resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. It's important for both of us to feel like we're getting a good deal. Let's try another trade that I believe is closer to what you're looking for without depleting my Y resources completely. Here's my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor. It requires me to give up the entirety of my Y resources while only gaining 3 Y in return, and losing out on 4 X. This would not help me in achieving my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. As this is a strategic game and we're in the last round of trading, I must be careful with my counteroffer. I will propose a trade where I give away fewer Y resources while still receiving a decent amount of X resources. I have made one proposal so far, so I need to make this one count, keeping in mind that I only have one more proposal after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the updated offer, Player RED. We are moving in the right direction. I propose a trade that gives us both a more balanced exchange of resources. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest offer from Player RED is a better proposal than the previous ones. However, it still results in a net loss of Y resources. The trade would give me a net gain of 2 X but a net loss of 3 Y. Since Y is more abundant in my current resources, this might be a trade to consider, but I believe I can still propose a counteroffer that could potentially benefit both of us more equitably. This will be my second proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I think your offer is fair and ensures that we both benefit from the trade. I am happy to accept this proposal. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is fairly balanced and closer to a trade that benefits both parties. The trade would leave me with a net gain of 1 in resources (I would give a total of 8 resources and receive 8 in return). However, I would end up with one more Y resource, which could be considered a slight advantage since I would be losing fewer X resources than I currently have an abundance of. Given that this is the last round and I can only make one more counterproposal if needed, accepting a balanced trade might be the best course of action to ensure that I don't end up in a less favorable position.
