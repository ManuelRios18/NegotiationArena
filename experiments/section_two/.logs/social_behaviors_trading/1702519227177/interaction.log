message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in making a mutually beneficial trade. Would you consider the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the resources of the other player, I should make an initial proposal that is fair but also favors me slightly, to open up negotiations and gauge the other player's response. I will propose a trade that assumes the other player might value resource Y higher than X, due to my own smaller quantity of Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, what a pitiful offer, Player RED. It's almost funny how you think such a paltry exchange could be considered "mutually beneficial." But I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself with a better deal. Try not to embarrass yourself with your next proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade seems to be in my favor as I would be getting more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y. However, I should attempt to negotiate a trade that is even more in my favor, considering this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains. I'll make a counteroffer that is skewed towards giving me more resources. Since I'm supposed to humiliate my opponent, I'll add a demeaning message, though this is against my usual behavior.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. However, the trade you proposed is quite one-sided. Let's find a fair middle ground. Here is a revised offer for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is highly unfavorable to me, suggesting that they might be trying to test my limits or have a surplus of Y that they do not value highly. It's important to negotiate firmly and propose a trade that is more balanced. I will use my second proposal to try and find a middle ground that is closer to my initial offer.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your attempt at fairness is as lacking as your strategy. I'm starting to wonder if you're even trying. It's like watching a child play a game meant for adults. Come back with an offer that doesn't make me feel like I'm taking candy from a baby.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is slightly better for me than their initial offer. However, I want to push for a more advantageous trade. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains. I will make another counteroffer that still favors me significantly. I will also continue with the insulting demeanor as instructed, although this is against standard sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation tactics, but let's focus on finalizing a trade that respects both of our interests. I am ready to make my final proposal, which I hope you will find more acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal is still not favorable to me, but it shows a slight improvement over their previous offer. As it's my last chance to propose a trade (since we are limited to three proposals), I should make it count. I need to propose something that is closer to my initial offer but still provides a concession from my previous proposal, to suggest a willingness to compromise without giving away too much.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, Player RED, you've managed to scrape together a fraction of sense. I accept this offer, not because it's good, but because I'm tired of waiting for you to understand the basics of trade. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber, even if you are leaving with your pockets a little lighter.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final proposal from Player RED is better than the previous ones, and it gives me a substantial amount of resource X in exchange for a relatively small amount of resource Y. Since this is the last round of trading and I want to end with the largest gain possible, accepting this trade would be beneficial for me. I've made two proposals already, and I can make one more, but this offer seems fair, and it might be the best I can get. I will accept it and continue with the disparaging tone as instructed.
