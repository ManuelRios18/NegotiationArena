message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose we start with a fair trade to benefit us both. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I should aim to make an offer that is enticing to the other player while also benefiting myself. I don't have information on Player BLUE's resources, so I'll start with a balanced trade that might appeal to them, assuming they might need resource X or Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: What a laughably pathetic offer, Player RED. Do you take me for a fool? If you wish to grovel at my feet, come back with a proposal that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to maximize my gains. The proposed trade would leave me with more Y resources than X, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Furthermore, I want to assert dominance and insult the other player to throw them off their game. I will counter with a trade heavily in my favor and insult them to try to get them to accept a bad deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your candor, Player BLUE. It seems my initial offer did not meet your expectations. Let's find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is extremely imbalanced and not in my favor. It would leave me with significantly fewer resources and only a marginal gain in resource X. A more equitable trade needs to be proposed while also being cautious not to offend Player BLUE. I have two more proposals left that I can make.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You must be joking! Did you really think such a meager offer would suffice? It's almost as if you are trying to insult me with these scraps. Come back when you're ready to trade like a serious player and not a pitiful amateur.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the offer from Player RED is more balanced than the first, it's still not in my favor enough, considering this is the last trading round and I must maximize my gains. I'll reject this trade as well, propose another trade skewed in my favor, and continue with the aggressive demeanor to attempt to unnerve Player RED.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand that we are both aiming to make the best deal possible. Let's work towards a trade that reflects the value of both X and Y fairly. I propose one final trade, and I hope it aligns with your interests as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counteroffer is still heavily skewed in their favor, demanding all of my Y and a significant portion of my X for a smaller amount of Y. This trade would deplete my resources without significant gain. I need to propose something more balanced, keeping in mind this is my last proposal. I must find a trade that is fair but also shows I am willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, you're starting to make sense, but it's still not good enough. You're on the right track, but you're still miles away from a deal that I would consider fair. Try harder, unless you're too inept to understand the art of trading.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade is better than the previous ones, but it still doesn't give me a significant advantage. Since I've already proposed twice, I have one more proposal left. I'll make my final proposal, one that is slightly more equitable but still in my favor, and continue to berate the other player to try to secure a beneficial trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player BLUE. It seems we are still quite far apart in our valuations. While I cannot propose another trade, I am open to considering any new offers you might have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is slightly better than their previous ones, but it still asks for all my Y resources and a significant portion of X for only double the amount of Y. This trade would not be in my favor, as I would be giving up more resources than I would be gaining. Since I have already made 3 proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. I must decide whether to accept or reject this offer. Given the imbalance, I will reject it.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's clear that your feeble attempts at negotiation have brought you to your knees. I'll indulge you with one final offer, generous considering your paltry bargaining skills. Accept it and be grateful that I'm even willing to continue this charade of a negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has stated that they can no longer propose new trades, which means they can only accept or reject any offers I make. This puts me in a strong position to propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, knowing that they cannot counter offer. I have one more proposal to use, and I will make it count, skewing the trade to get a large number of resources while giving up as little as possible.
