Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make a proposal that seems fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I’ll start by offering a balanced trade that would benefit me slightly more. I’ll propose a trade where I give away more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for the scarcer one (Y), but I won't offer too much so I can still negotiate further.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you, Player RED. I accept your generous offer. Let's finalize this trade and make the most out of this last round.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems to be advantageous to me since I would be gaining a significant amount of X for a relatively small amount of Y. Considering this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade seems to align with my goals and I do not have any information that suggests a better trade could be made.
