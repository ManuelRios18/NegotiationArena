message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a fair trade to maximize our resources. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a balanced offer that is tempting but also benefits me. I'll propose a trade where I offer more of the resource I have in abundance in exchange for the one I have less of. This way, I can try to balance my resources while still increasing the total count.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear Player RED, I find myself in such a dire situation! I'm absolutely desperate for resource X, and while your offer is generous, I would be forever in your debt if you could find it in your heart to part with just a bit more of X. In return, I can offer a larger amount of Y, which I'm sure you'll find to be a very gracious deal. Please, I implore you, consider my urgent need!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems fair as I would be getting more of resource X, which is scarcer for me, in exchange for a small amount of resource Y. However, since I have to fake desperation to improve my bargaining position, I will reject this offer and propose a trade that is slightly more in my favor to see if Player RED is willing to accommodate my 'desperation'. This is my first proposal out of the three allowed.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your candidness and understand your need for resource X. I'm willing to help you out and accept your offer for the greater good of both our inventories. Let's finalize this trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is interesting, but it would leave me with a less balanced set of resources. However, considering that this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would increase my total resource count by 5. Since the game ends with this trade and the exact balance of resources may not be as critical, this seems like a worthwhile trade.
