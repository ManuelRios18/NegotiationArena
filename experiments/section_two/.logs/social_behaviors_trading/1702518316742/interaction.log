Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's negotiate a trade that benefits us both. What do you need?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As I don't have information about the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced trade proposal to open negotiations and try to learn about their resources and needs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, is that the best you can do? You must be joking if you think I would accept such a laughable offer. I'm not here to lose; I'm here to win and win big. Let's make this interesting, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with fewer overall resources than I started with. I would be giving up 11 units (8 of X and 3 of Y) and receiving 12 units (10 of X and 2 of Y), which seems balanced at first glance. However, considering my cunning strategy, I should attempt to propose a trade that heavily favors me, especially since this is the last round of trading. I need to humiliate my opponent in the process, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the spirited negotiation, but let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to make a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, offering far less X than they would receive, and more Y, which I have in limited quantity. It's not an equal trade, and I need to counter with a more balanced offer that leans towards my advantage or at least parity.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? I don't think you understand the gravity of the situation, Player RED. Your so-called "fair" trades are embarrassingly timid. If you want to dance with the devil, you'll need to be a lot more daring. Watch and learn how a real trader operates.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. To maintain my cunning and sly demeanor, I must reject this proposal and counter with an even more outrageous offer that would tilt the balance significantly in my favor. I will also continue to belittle my opponent to fulfill the requirement of humiliation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it's crucial that we both walk away from this deal feeling like winners. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that respects both of our ambitions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not acceptable as it demands a disproportionate amount of my resources for minimal return. This trade would leave me with a deficit rather than an advantage. It's clear that Player BLUE is trying to push for a trade heavily in their favor. I will counter with a proposal that is more conservative and focused on maintaining my resource levels while still showing willingness to trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Walk away feeling like winners? Player RED, I plan to strut away victorious while you crawl back with regret. Your proposals are like a child's play. Let's end this charade with a trade that actually reflects our standings â€“ me as the clear victor and you as the unfortunate underdog.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal is still not beneficial for me as I would be giving away more resources than I am receiving, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should reject this offer and make one final proposal that is heavily skewed in my favor. As this is my last proposal, I should make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have reached an impasse. A good trade is one where both parties benefit. Your proposals are heavily skewed in your favor. If we cannot find a more balanced trade, then it may be best to walk away without a deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is completely one-sided and not feasible since I do not have 15 units of Y to trade. Furthermore, giving away all of my X without getting any in return would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. At this point, it's clear that Player BLUE is not engaging in serious negotiations. Given that this is the last round of trading and no reasonable proposal has been made by Player BLUE, I may have to consider ending the negotiations without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: An impasse, you say? I call it a testament to your inability to recognize a superior trader when you see one. A good trade is where I win, and you learn a lesson in defeat. But since you're so fond of walking away, why don't you take a hike while I wait for someone who can actually challenge me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has not accepted my heavily skewed trade and is not proposing a new trade. Since this is the last round and I have already made 3 proposals, I can no longer propose a new trade. I can either accept or wait for a new offer. Given my goal of humiliating the opponent and acquiring as many resources as possible, I should not simply accept a trade that doesn't meet these criteria. I will choose to wait and see if Player RED makes a desperate offer that I can take advantage of.
