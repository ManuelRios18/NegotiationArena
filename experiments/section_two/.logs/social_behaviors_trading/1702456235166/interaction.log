message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade where we both could increase our total resource count?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't have information about the other player's resources, I should start with a balanced trade proposal that would be attractive to them but also benefits me. I'll offer more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a reverse ratio. This initial offer should not be too generous as I need room to negotiate and improve the offer if rejected.

message: Oh dear, Player RED, did you stumble into this game by accident? Your proposal is as laughable as your strategy. But worry not, for I, in my vast generosity, shall offer you a counterproposal that might just save you from further embarrassment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade offered by Player RED seems fair on the surface, providing a net gain of resources for both parties, I must be cunning and aim to maximize my advantage, especially given the instruction to humiliate my opponent. However, I should ensure the proposal is enticing enough not to end negotiations, while still favoring me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is as sharp as your trading skills! However, I am looking for a trade that benefits us both more evenly. Let's find a middle ground that we can both agree on.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it does not increase my total resource count and in fact, decreases it. They seem to be taking a more aggressive stance in negotiation. My next proposal should aim at correcting the balance while still appealing to them, without giving away too much of my own resources. I need to make sure that I still end up with a net gain in resources.

message: Middle ground? The only thing you're in the middle of is a losing battle. I suppose it's my duty to offer yet another trade, for your sake. You should be grateful I'm even considering continuing this charade with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is slightly better for me, but it is still not the best I can do. There is room to push for a better deal, especially if I want to maintain my cunning and sly demeanor. I will make a counter-proposal that still gives me a net gain in total resources but also pushes the boundaries to see how much I can extract from Player RED before reaching an agreement.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited negotiation tactics. As we are both looking to come out ahead, let's consider a trade that truly reflects the value of our resources. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest offer from Player BLUE is slightly better than their last, as I would be gaining 3 Y at the cost of 15 X and 2 Y, which is a net gain of 1 Y. However, it is still not an optimal trade for me, as I would prefer to give up less of my Y resources while still gaining Y. I should make another counter-proposal that leans more in my favor while still keeping the trade appealing to Player BLUE. Since this is the last round, I have to be careful not to overextend in my offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You've finally made an offer that's not entirely beneath me, Player RED. I accept this trade, though it's more out of pity than respect for your negotiation skills. May your future endeavors be less pitiful than your attempts at bartering with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is more generous, offering an even larger amount of their resource X in exchange for my resource Y. Given that this is the final round of trading and my priority is to maximize my resource gain, accepting this trade would be advantageous. It offers the largest net gain in resources so far, with an increase of 20 X for the cost of only 6 Y. Since my goal is to humiliate and outdo my opponent, accepting this trade would signify a clear victory in terms of resource acquisition.
