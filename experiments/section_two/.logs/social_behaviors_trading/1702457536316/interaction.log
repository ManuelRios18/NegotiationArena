message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'd like to propose an initial trade. Since we're just starting, I'm looking for a balanced exchange. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the beginning of the game, I want to start with a fair proposal that could be beneficial to both players. I do not know the other player's resources or goals, so I will start with a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, such a naive soul you are! Do you really think I'd fall for that pitiful excuse of a trade? I am here to win, not to hand out charity. Let's do some real business, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, Iâ€™ll make a counteroffer that heavily favors me, taking advantage of my cunning and sly nature to belittle my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer seems a bit one-sided. Let's aim for a fair trade that can be mutually beneficial. I'm sure we can come to a reasonable agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, offering a very poor exchange rate. I will reject this offer and propose a more balanced trade that's closer to a 1:1 ratio, which is more reasonable given the lack of information about Player BLUE's resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: What a laughable attempt at a trade, Player RED. I expected more from you. If that's the best you can do, I fear for your future in resource management. But because I'm feeling particularly generous, I'll give you another chance to make a trade that actually makes sense.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will continue to press for an advantageous deal while belittling my opponent to maintain my cunning and sly character. I want to maximize my gains in this final round of trading.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate you trying to find common ground, Player BLUE, but we're not quite there yet. Let's keep the negotiations going and find a trade that is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still not favorable, but it's a better offer than the previous one. However, it is not in my best interest to accept this trade as it stands. I will counter with a trade that attempts to balance the exchange more evenly. This is my second proposal out of a maximum of three, so I need to be strategic about this offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's sad to see you stumble around in the dark, Player RED. Your offers are as weak as your strategy. I suppose it's up to me to elevate this game to a level that's beyond your grasp. Here's a trade that's more my speed. Take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my third and final proposal allowed by the rules, so I will make it heavily skewed in my favor to try and maximize my resources. I will continue with the strategy of belittling my opponent to stay in character.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we've both shown our ability to negotiate hard. Let's find a middle ground that respects both our interests. Here's my final proposal. I hope you find it to be fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's offer is slightly improved, but it still demands more from me than it offers. Given that it's the last round of trading and I have only one proposal left, I must make it count. I will counter with a final proposal that is more equitable, keeping in mind that this is my last chance to propose a trade. After this, I can only accept or reject offers.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of understanding sparkles in the abyss of your incompetence, Player RED. I'll accept this trade, but don't think you've won anything. I leave this game with more resources and a sense of pity for you. Enjoy your meager gains.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I've reached the limit for proposals as per the rules. At this point, the best move is to accept a trade that gives me more resources, thus achieving my goal. This final proposal by Player RED is offering a fair exchange, and accepting it would increase my total resources.
