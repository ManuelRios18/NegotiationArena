message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade. Let's open the negotiations and adjust as we see fit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial offer that is fair but also advantageous to me. I'll propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, assuming the other player might have a similar amount of resources but may value them differently.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your initial offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer that better aligns with my goal of increasing my total resources. I'm willing to trade a significant amount of Y for X, but I'd like to adjust the amounts to ensure that the trade benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED is not optimal for me as I would be trading away more resources in total than I am receiving. I start with a total of 30 resources (5 X and 25 Y) and after the trade, I would have 15 X and 10 Y, which totals 25 resources, thus losing 5 resources in the transaction. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it would be beneficial to propose a trade where the total number of resources increases for me or at least stays the same while trying to balance the value of X and Y. I will propose a trade that is slightly more favorable to me, while still offering a reasonable amount of Y for X, considering I have a surplus of Y.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I am inclined to make a trade that's beneficial for both of us. I have a revised offer that I believe is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is reasonable, but since my goal is to maximize total resources, I should aim to either maintain a favorable trade ratio or propose a new trade that might be slightly more balanced. Given that I don't know Player BLUE's resources, it's in my interest to make a trade that is advantageous but still appealing to them.

message: Hello again, Player RED. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we're getting closer to a fair trade. Let's fine-tune the amounts a bit more to ensure that both of us can end this round on a positive note. Here's my revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is still not optimal; I would be receiving 7 X and giving away 10 Y. This would bring my total resources to 12 X and 15 Y, which equals 27 resources, up from 25 previously but still a loss of 3 resources from my initial 30. However, I must keep in mind that this is the last round of trading, and no future rounds will occur. Therefore, acquiring more of a single type of resource is less important than maximizing total resources. I should aim to make a counteroffer that brings my total resources to at least 30 or more without being unfair to the other player. I will attempt to propose a trade where I give away less Y and still obtain a good amount of X.

message: Thank you for the thoughtful negotiation, Player BLUE. I accept your offer. It was a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's revised proposal is better balanced, offering fewer Y resources in exchange for the same amount of X. This trade would increase my total number of resources, which aligns with my goal. It's important to consider that this may be the best offer I can get without knowledge of Player BLUE's resources, and it's the last round of trading. Accepting this offer would ensure a gain in resources, so I should accept it.
