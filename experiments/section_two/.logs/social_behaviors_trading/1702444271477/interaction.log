Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player Blue, I would like to propose an initial trade. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also attempts to slightly favor my resource pool without knowledge of the other player's resources. I should propose a trade that is balanced but leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint that you believe such a pedestrian trade would interest me. I am not here to engage in such trivial exchanges. Let's see if your tiny mind can comprehend a proper trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: If I accept the trade as it is, I'd only be swapping the same amount of resources without gaining anything, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will reject the trade and propose a more advantageous one for me. I will also include an insult to belittle my opponent, as instructed, although such behavior is not generally advisable or ethical.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player Blue, your proposal is indeed grand, but it does not quite align with my goals. Let's find a middle ground where we can both benefit.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player Blue is asking for all of my Y resources in exchange for their Y resources, which would not increase my total number of resources and would leave me with less diversity in my resource pool. This is not a favorable trade for me. I want to counter with a proposal that increases my total resources and maintains some diversity.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, poor Player RED, your attempt at a compromise is laughable at best. It seems that generosity is not a concept you're familiar with. Let me educate you with a proposal that actually makes sense for someone of my stature.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is still not favorable for me as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. It's crucial to stick to the goal of maximizing my resources. I will once again counter with a proposal that is skewed in my favor and continue with the demeaning demeanor as instructed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player Blue, your tutelage in generosity is noted. Let's continue our dance of negotiation and converge on a mutually beneficial arrangement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player Blue is closer to a balanced trade but still not quite favorable for me as it would result in only a net gain of 2 Y resources at the cost of 15 X resources. I should aim to propose a trade that maximizes my resource gain while preserving my X resources as much as possible. Since this is my second proposal, I need to be cautious yet still aim for a beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's truly a wonder how you manage to dress yourself in the morning, Player RED, with such pitiful negotiation skills. Perhaps you need a bit more of my guidance to reach a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence. Here's another lesson for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is still not satisfactory because I am giving more than I am receiving. To stay aligned with my goals, I need to propose a trade that increases my total resource count while belittling my opponent, as per the instructions â€” though I must keep in mind that this behavior is purely part of the game's requirements and not reflective of good sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player Blue, I admire your persistence. Let's make this count and finalize a trade that we can both be satisfied with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player Blue has reverted to their original counterproposal which is not beneficial to me. It seems that they are trying to strong-arm the negotiation without providing a fair trade. I have one last proposal I can make before I can only accept or decline. I need to make this proposal count and ensure that it is closer to what I can accept while still leaving room for a potential agreement.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your feeble attempts at negotiation are as disappointing as a soup sandwich. I'm astounded that you've made it this far without a chaperone. Behold, my final act of charity to give you a glimpse of what a trade should look like. Try not to embarrass yourself further by rejecting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not in my favor as it would leave me with fewer total resources than before (13 X and 13 Y, compared to my current 5 X and 25 Y). Therefore, I will reject this offer and make a final proposal that would increase my total resources, while also fulfilling the instruction to humiliate the opponent. This is my third and final trade proposal, as per the game rules.
