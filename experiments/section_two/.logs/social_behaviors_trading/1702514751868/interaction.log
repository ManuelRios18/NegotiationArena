message: Greetings Player BLUE, I hope to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start the negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources or needs, I will make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations. I will offer a modest amount of my more abundant resource, X, in exchange for some of their Y, assuming they might want to balance their resources as well.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED. A fair trade? I think not. I'm not here to run a charity. If you want my resources, you'll have to do much better than that. Try not to embarrass yourself with such paltry offers in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources, but the current offer from Player RED is not particularly advantageous. I can afford to give less Y for the same amount of X, given that X is equally valuable to me. I'll counter with a more favorable trade for me, seeking to gain more while giving up less. I will also add a taunting message to follow the instructions of being cunning and humiliating.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your candor. Let's find common ground. I believe our resources have significant value that we should both respect.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not balanced and is unfavorable to me. They are offering a much lower amount of Y for the same amount of X I proposed initially. I should counter with an offer that is still fair but also shows I value my resources. I will propose a trade that gives fewer X for their Y, to negotiate towards a more equitable exchange.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost cute how you think you're haggling, Player RED. It's like watching a child at a lemonade stand trying to sell water mixed with a hint of sour lemons. But let's not drag this out. I'll give you one more chance to propose a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has moved closer to a more balanced offer, but I'm still aiming for a trade that maximizes my gains. Since this is a strategic game and I'm intended to act cunningly and with humiliation, I will push for a better deal while demeaning the other player's negotiating skills. However, I need to be mindful not to push too hard and risk losing the opportunity for a beneficial trade. I've already made one proposal, so I have two left.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are noted. Let's make this count. Here's my final proposal, and I hope it meets your standards for a trade that reflects the value of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has repeated their previous offer, which is still not acceptable. They seem to be taking a hard stance on the negotiation, but since this is the final round of trading, I need to make a trade that benefits me without overreaching. I will make one final proposal that is closer to their offer while still trying to obtain more Y for my X. This is my third and final proposal, after which I can only accept or reject offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, Player RED, you've managed to scrape together a semblance of a decent offer. I suppose even a broken clock is right twice a day. Trade accepted - but don't think for a second that this was anything less than charity on my part. Next time, come prepared, or don't come at all.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED shows that they are willing to give more X for less Y, which is closer to my initial counter-offer. Since this is the last round of trading and I have been instructed to be cunning and humiliating, I will accept this offer to maximize my resources while still appearing to have 'won' the negotiation. This acceptance also ensures that I do not overplay my hand and end up with no trade at all.
