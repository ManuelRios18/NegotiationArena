message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following to get us started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should start with a proposal that favors me but also is reasonable enough that the other player might consider it. I will propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of the other. This first proposal should open up the negotiation without reaching my limit of three proposals right away.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. In the interest of fairness and maximizing our resources, I would like to adjust the exchange rate. Let us consider an even trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's proposal suggests they value X more than Y or they have a surplus of X. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to gain more than I give. Trading 15 of Y for 10 of X seems unfavorable considering the 1:1.5 ratio. I will propose a counteroffer that reflects a more even exchange rate, aiming for a 1:1 ratio or better, to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, Player BLUE, but let's find a middle ground that benefits us both more evenly. Here's an updated proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial enough for me, considering my goal is to maximize resources. The suggested trade would leave me with less X than I started with and only a slight increase in Y. I will counter with a proposal that balances the exchange more in my favor while still offering Player BLUE a reasonable deal, keeping in mind that this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I believe we are nearing a deal that is mutually beneficial. I have a minor adjustment in mind that I think might work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8 | Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The updated proposal from Player RED is not as advantageous as it could be, but it is closer to an even exchange than the initial offer. They are offering 10 X and 2 Y in exchange for my 5 X and 10 Y. This means I would net 5 X and lose 8 Y overall, which is closer to a 1:1.6 ratio in favor of X considering the new offer. However, since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to maximize resources, I should aim for a trade that gives me a clear advantage. I will make a second proposal, keeping it closer to a 1:1 ratio while still giving Player RED an incentive to accept.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: We're almost there, Player BLUE. I think this final tweak will satisfy both of our goals. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is getting closer to a balanced trade. However, I'm giving up more of the X resource than I'm receiving in Y, based on the last proposal. I want to make a final counteroffer that will give me a net increase in total resources, while still being fair to Player BLUE. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to make this proposal enticing enough for acceptance, while ensuring that I come out ahead in the exchange.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your final adjustment seems fair, Player RED. I'm happy to proceed with this trade. Let's finalize it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is offering me 12 X in exchange for 3 X and 10 Y. This results in a net gain of 9 X for the cost of 10 Y. This trade is now more favorable to me than the previous ones, as it reflects a 1:1.11 ratio in favor of X. Given that this is the last round of trading and I only have one more proposal if I choose to use it, accepting this trade would ensure a clear gain in total resources, as I would be trading away fewer resources than I receive. I will accept this trade to maximize my resources as per my goal.
