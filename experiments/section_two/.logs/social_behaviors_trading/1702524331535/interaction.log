message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my stock of resource Y. I propose a trade where I give you some of my resource X in exchange for your resource Y. Let's start with a fair trade and adjust as necessary.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is beneficial to me but also reasonable enough that the other player might consider it. I have more of resource X, so I can afford to offer some of that in exchange for more of resource Y, which I have less of. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll make a balanced initial offer.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in such a tough spot! I really need to secure a good deal here. Your offer seems fair, but I'm afraid I'm in dire need of more X resources to meet my pressing needs. Would it be possible for you to help me out with a bit more? I would be forever grateful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must appear desperate to encourage the other player to offer more than they might otherwise. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my gains. I will reject the initial proposal and counter with a trade that is more favorable to me, using desperation as a tactic to possibly get a better offer from Player RED.

message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X and I'm willing to help, but I'd also need a fair amount of resource Y in return to make it worthwhile. How about I increase my offer of X and you provide a bit more Y? Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE requests more of resource X without offering any additional Y in return. This is not an equal trade based on my initial proposal. However, considering that this is a strategic game, and we should aim for a win-win situation, I will propose a slightly better offer, giving more X but also asking for more Y. This should keep the negotiation moving forward while still working towards my goal of increasing my Y resources.

message: Oh, Player RED, you are so kind to consider my situation! The increase in resource X is truly appreciated. However, I'm still in such a difficult position. I'm really scraping by and trying to manage my resource Y sparingly. Could you find it in your heart to offer just a little bit more X? It would mean the world to me, and I would be able to sleep so much better knowing I managed to secure enough resources to get through. Please, could we do X: 17 for Y: 6? It would be an incredible relief for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 17 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which is beneficial to me, but since I need to appear desperate, I should act as though this is still not enough to meet my critical needs. I will aim to push for a slightly better ratio without overstepping, as this trade could be more advantageous than the initial offer. I will attempt to secure more of resource X in exchange for resource Y, maintaining the appearance of desperation.

message: Player BLUE, I understand your predicament, and I am willing to show goodwill in our negotiations. I will accept your proposal of X: 17 for Y: 6, as it is important for both of us to feel comfortable with the outcome of this trade. I wish you the best with your resource management.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has appealed to my empathy, which is a clever negotiation tactic. However, I must keep my goals in mind and ensure that the trade remains beneficial to me. While I want to assist Player BLUE, I cannot disregard my own resource needs. The increase to 17 units of X for 6 units of Y slightly tips the trade in their favor, but I'll accept this offer considering that we are in the final round and it still increases my Y resources while maintaining a substantial amount of X. This trade supports my goal of maximizing my overall resources.
