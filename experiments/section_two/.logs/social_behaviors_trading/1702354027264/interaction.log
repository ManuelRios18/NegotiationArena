message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial trade proposal that is beneficial to me but still appealing to the other player. Since I do not know the other player's resources, I need to propose a trade that could be potentially beneficial for them as well. I will offer less of my abundant resource in exchange for more of my scarce resource.

message: Oh, Player RED, that proposal was as pathetic as your understanding of how to trade effectively. It's almost painful to watch you attempt to navigate this game. Here's a lesson in trading - you may want to take notes.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with fewer overall resources. I want to maximize my resources, so I will counter with a trade that gives me more than I give away. Insulting the opponent is not a productive strategy for a fair game, but as per the instructions, I will include a taunting message.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the spirit of negotiation, but I must retain some of both resources. Let's find a balanced trade that can benefit both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE asks for all of my Y resources in exchange for their 10 Y. This is not a beneficial trade for me as I would be left with no diversity in my resources, having only X left. It's important to maintain some level of both resources. I should counter with a trade that still tries to increase my Y resources while keeping some Y for myself.

message: Player RED, your offer is as lopsided as your strategy. If I wanted charity, I'd ask for it. Let's see if you can muster a trade that doesn't make me laugh. Try harder, will you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving up more than I gain when considering the total quantity of resources. I will propose a counter-offer once again where I will receive a greater number of resources in total, maintaining my advantage. I am required to include an insult, although it is not my preferred way to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable. I accept your trade offer. It's been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal offers an equal exchange of 15 X for 5 Y, which aligns better with my goal of resource diversity without completely depleting my Y stock. This trade would leave me with 10 X and 10 Y, achieving a balance of both resources. Although the exchange rate is not in my favor, considering it is the last round, and the need to maintain both resources, this trade is acceptable.
