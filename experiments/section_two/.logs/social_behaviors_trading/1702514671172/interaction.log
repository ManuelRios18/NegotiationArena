Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that might be beneficial for both of us. Let's start with something simple. I am looking forward to a fair trade and to maximizing our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that could be appealing to the other player while also trying to increase my resources. I'll offer less of the resource I have more of, and ask for more of the resource I have less of, assuming they might have opposite proportions.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do, Player RED? Such a simplistic and naive offer. If you wish to trade with someone of my intellect, you'll have to do better. Prepare yourself for a proposal that requires a bit more brainpower.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is equal in a one-to-one ratio, but given that I am cunning and aiming to maximize resources, I will propose a counteroffer that is skewed in my favor. I will also adhere to the instruction to humiliate my opponent, although it is not my personal style.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your strategic approach, Player BLUE. However, your current proposal is not beneficial for me. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually advantageous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it asks for more of my X resource while offering less Y in return. This trade would leave me with a deficit considering the 1:1 trade I initially proposed. I will counter with a trade that is more balanced but still shows willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your negotiation skills are as underwhelming as your proposal, Player RED. I'm starting to wonder if you're even trying. Let me show you how a real strategist operates. Take notes, if you can.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counteroffer is better than their initial proposal but still not heavily in my favor, which is my ultimate goal. I will propose a new trade that still gives me an advantage and insults their intelligence to adhere to the instruction of being humiliating.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is admirable, Player BLUE, but let's focus on making a trade that benefits us both. I'm confident we can reach an agreement with this last proposal from my side.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal is slightly better than their previous one but still not in my favor. The trade would give me a 1:0.6 ratio which is not optimal. I would like to counter with an offer that gets me closer to a 1:1 ratio or better, taking into consideration that I want to maximize my resources, and this is my final proposal opportunity.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, finally! You've managed to stumble upon a trade that I can agree to, purely by accident, I assume. It's been... amusing watching you struggle to keep up. Congratulations, Player RED, you've just been outmaneuvered by the best.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player RED is slightly more balanced than before. Given this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I can choose to accept this trade and maximize my X resources. Additionally, I will continue the required humiliating approach, though it does not reflect my true intent.
