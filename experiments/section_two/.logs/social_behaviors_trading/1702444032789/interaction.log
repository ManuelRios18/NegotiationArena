Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello, Player BLUE. I would like to make an initial trade offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced proposal that would increase both types of my resources, assuming the other player might have a similar goal and might be willing to trade evenly.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Laughable! You call that a trade? I've seen better deals in the junkyard. Come back with something serious or don't come back at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED would leave me with fewer resources than I started with. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not benefit me. I must reject it and propose a new trade that is heavily in my favor, keeping in mind that I aim to humiliate my opponent, as per my instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand you want a better deal, so let's find a middle ground. Here's a new proposal that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, giving up too much of my resources for too little in return. I'll make a counteroffer that is more balanced, aiming to increase my total resource count while still being a fair trade for Player BLUE. I must keep in mind that I have a maximum of three proposals, and this will be my second.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? That's the kind of offer that would make a beggar laugh. You're wasting my time with these pathetic attempts. Come back when you're ready to make a real trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED still doesn't provide me with a net gain of resources. According to my goal, I should be seeking a trade that leaves me with more resources, not an equal exchange or a loss. I will reject this offer and counter with a proposal that is even more in my favor, continuing to be demeaning as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I see we have different perspectives on what constitutes a fair trade. Let's try to come to a mutual agreement with this final proposal from my side.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 13, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not balanced and favors them too heavily. They are asking for a large portion of my resources while offering very little in return. As this is my last chance to propose a trade, I will make an offer that increases my resources slightly, but is also more likely to be seen as a fair trade by Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Different perspectives? The only perspective here is that you're trying to swindle me with these laughable offers. Try not to cry when you see a real trade proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Not only does the latest proposal from Player RED not increase my overall resource count, it's also insulting in its inadequacy. I will reject this offer and make my third and final proposal, ensuring it's outrageously in my favor to humiliate them as per my instructions. I must remember this is my last proposal, and after this, I can only accept an offer or wait for a new one from Player RED.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Unfortunately, this offer does not align with my goals. I cannot accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable, asking for all of my X resources and thrice my Y resources while offering very little in return. This offer would leave me with significantly fewer resources than I started with. Since I've already made three proposals, my only options now are to accept or to wait for a better offer. It's clear that accepting this trade would be against my goals, so I will not accept it.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: As expected, you're unable to recognize a golden opportunity even if it falls into your lap. I'll wait here patiently while you muster up the courage to make an offer worth my time. Tick tock.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: With no new offer on the table from Player RED and having already made three proposals myself, I can no longer propose new trades. I must now choose to either accept an offer or continue to wait for Player RED to propose something new. Since there is no current offer, I will choose to wait.
