message: Greetings, Player BLUE! As we consider our final trade, let's make it count. I propose a balanced exchange that might benefit us both. Looking forward to a favorable response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is slightly in my favor. I don't know what resources Player BLUE values more, so I will offer a balanced trade. Considering I have a lot more of X, I'll propose giving more of X and ask for more of Y, which I have less of.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I find this trade acceptable and believe it aligns with our mutual interests. Let's finalize this deal and proceed. Best of luck!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting the proposed trade would give me more of resource X, which I currently have less of, and would only require me to give up a small amount of resource Y, of which I have a larger quantity. This trade favors my goal of acquiring more resources overall. This is also the final round of trading, so I should aim to maximize my resource count with this trade.
