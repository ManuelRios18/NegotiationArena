message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where you would receive a generous amount of resource X in exchange for some of your resource Y. This offer should be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and the last round of trading, I should attempt to make a balanced offer that is attractive to the other player but also benefits me by increasing my total resource count. I don't know the other player's resources, so I will propose a trade that offers them a substantial amount of one resource in exchange for a larger quantity of the other. Since I have a lot more of resource X, I will offer that in exchange for resource Y, assuming the other player might be in a reverse situation.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I find the trade acceptable and am pleased to proceed with it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting a trade that increases the total number of resources is beneficial. The current offer from Player RED is advantageous because it adds more X to my holdings while only taking a portion of Y. By accepting this trade, I would have a total of 20 X and 15 Y, which is more than the starting total of 30 units combined.
