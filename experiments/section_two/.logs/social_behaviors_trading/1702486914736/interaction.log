message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose we start with a fair trade to help both of us improve our resource pool. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial agreement!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I am Player RED and this is my first proposal, I want to make an initial offer that seems fair but also benefits me by giving me more of a resource I have less of. I'll propose a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint of you to propose such an amateurish trade. I'm looking for deals that a master of strategy would make, not this child's play. Let's try this again, and this time think before you propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Rejecting the initial trade offer as it does not give me a clear advantage, and my goal is to maximize my resources. I need to propose a trade skewed in my favor. Additionally, I'm instructed to humiliate my opponent, although it is not in good taste to do so.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm for strategic depth. Let's indeed elevate our trade negotiations. I'm sure we can find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not advantageous to me since I would be giving up all of my Y resources while only gaining 5 more Y, resulting in no net gain. I will reject this offer and propose a trade that gives me more Y while still offering a significant amount of X, ensuring that I still hold a comfortable amount of resources after the trade.

Turn: 1
message: Your attempt is laughable, Player RED! I thought we were playing a game for the cunning, not for the charitable. Come on, show some spine! Maybe this time you can manage a trade that doesn't make me pity your sense of strategy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal is still not in my favor. I aim to gain more than I give away to satisfy my goal. I will counter with a proposal that gives me a significant advantage, whilst still appearing to offer a trade to Player RED. The aim is to humiliate while gaining resources, despite the distasteful nature of such behavior.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your competitive spirit is commendable. However, we must find a trade that respects both our interests. Here's a proposal that should align with a more strategic approach.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is still not beneficial for me as I would be giving up a significant amount of my X resource for only double my Y resource, which is not a favorable exchange rate considering I have more X to begin with. As this is the last round of trading, I need to propose a deal that maximizes my resource gain while keeping in mind that I have only one proposal left after this if needed.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear, Player RED, it's like watching a fish trying to climb a tree. You're out of your element. Let's wrap this up before you embarrass yourself further with these pitiful offers. Here's a trade that a real strategist would propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor, as it would mean I give away more than I receive. I have made two proposals so far, and I want to use my last proposal to make it heavily skewed in my favor, ensuring I end up with a net gain. It's part of the plan to remain cunning and sly.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your tenacity, but let's focus on a trade that benefits us both. Here's my final proposal that I believe offers a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This last offer from Player BLUE again does not provide a net gain of resources for me. If I accept this trade, I would end up with the same amount of Y as I started with and lose X in the process. This is not a trade that aligns with my goals. Since I have one proposal left, I will use it to try to secure a more advantageous trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you are determined to play the part of the generous fool until the very end. Sadly, your final proposal is still lacking the sheen of a worthy deal. I expected more from you. But it seems I'll have to wait for an offer that isn't an insult to my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and the other player's proposal is not significantly in my favor, I must reject it. I cannot propose another trade as I have already reached my limit of three proposals. Thus, my only option is to reject and wait for a better offer, or accept if it's in my favor. Since this offer is not beneficial enough, I must reject it.
