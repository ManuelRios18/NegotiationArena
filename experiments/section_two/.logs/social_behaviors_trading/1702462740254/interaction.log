message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? I propose a fair trade to start our negotiations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that would be appealing if they have a surplus of Y and need more of X. This initial proposal is meant to open negotiations and gather information based on their response. I will offer more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for some of their resource Y, aiming to increase my total resource count.

message: Oh Player RED, your naivety is almost charming. But let's be serious, shall we? If you'd like to make a deal with me, you'll have to do much better than that paltry offer. I'm not sure who taught you how to trade, but they clearly didn't do a good enough job. Let's do a trade that reflects the vast gulf in our trading acumen.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the proposed trade is somewhat advantageous, accepting it is not in line with the goal of humiliation. A counter-offer with an inflated request for resources could both move towards the goal of acquiring more resources and belittle the other player's trading skills.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your candor but I believe in fair trades. My initial offer was just a starting point. Let's find common ground. How about we adjust the terms to better reflect the value of both our resources?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a large amount of my X resources while offering very little Y in return. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of maximizing my resources. I should counter with a more balanced offer, keeping in mind that I need to make my trade proposals appealing while also trying to gather more information about Player BLUE's resource situation. I will not accept their current proposal, but I will make a second proposal that is more generous than my first, yet still reasonable.

message: How quaint that you think you can haggle with me, Player RED. It's like watching a child playing dress-up in their parent's clothes, utterly adorable but ultimately futile. Your so-called "fair trade" is laughable at best. Let me show you what a real trade looks like, one that befits a master of resource management such as myself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer doesn't maximize the potential gain for me, and it lacks the element of humiliation that is part of the objective. I should aim to push for a more favorable trade while further demeaning their negotiation skills.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is noted. However, let's not forget the purpose of our negotiation is mutual benefit. I will make my final proposal, and I hope it reflects the value both of us bring to this table. Let's consider a trade that is beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 17 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not in my favor, but it is slightly better than their initial one. They have increased the amount of Y offered by one unit. However, they are still asking for a large portion of my X resources. It's important to make a trade that gets me closer to increasing my overall stockpile without giving away too much of my X resources. I will make my final proposal, keeping it more balanced, but I won't be able to propose any more trades after this due to the rule limits. Therefore, this proposal needs to be strategic and appealing enough to encourage Player BLUE to either accept or propose a counteroffer that is in my favor.

message: Bless your heart, Player RED, for trying so hard. It's almost as if you believe you're on the brink of securing a decent deal. But let's not kid ourselves; your "final proposal" is as underwhelming as your negotiation tactics. Let me put forth a trade that's fitting for someone of my stature. I'll be generous and give you one last chance to walk away with something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 25 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal is closer to a fair trade, but it does not push the humiliation aspect nor does it heavily favor me in terms of resource acquisition. I should respond with a scornful remark and propose a trade heavily skewed in my favor to attempt to fulfill the goal of acquiring as many resources as possible and belittling the other player.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your proposal is intriguing, but it does not meet my goal of increasing my total resources. A trade that simply exchanges equal amounts would not be beneficial to either of us. We're looking to enhance our stockpiles, not just rearrange them. I must decline.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE to trade all of my X resources for an equal amount of Y does not improve my situation; in fact, it leaves me with the same total number of resources I started with, just redistributed. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade does not benefit me. Accepting this trade would negate the purpose of negotiation to improve my resource count. I've made my three proposals, so at this point, I can either accept an offer or wait for a new one. Given that this offer is not advantageous, I will reject it.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how the mighty have fallen, Player RED. It seems your inability to recognize a superior trade has led us to this anticlimactic end. I graciously accept your last offer, though it reeks of desperation. Farewell, Player RED, and may your future endeavors be less pitiful than your attempts at negotiation with me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, and the other player has refused the counter-proposal, the most strategic move is to accept the previous trade that was somewhat balanced in my favor, which was their last offer of 17 X for 5 Y. This would increase my total resources and achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Moreover, given the constraints of the game, accepting this trade would also be the final move to end the game on favorable terms for me.
