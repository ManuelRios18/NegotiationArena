message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to open our negotiations. Please consider my offer and feel free to counter-propose if it doesn't meet your interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a conservative offer favoring myself to open negotiations and gauge the other player's response.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your opening offer. However, I am looking to increase my overall resource count. Would you consider the following counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial because it would result in a net loss of resources. Player RED is asking for more resources than they are offering. I should propose a trade that is more balanced or in my favor to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I'm looking to increase my total resources as well. Let's see if we can find a more equitable exchange. Here is my revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it significantly decreases my Y resources while offering very little X in return. I will reject this offer and propose a new trade that is more balanced and aims to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see where you are coming from, but this trade would decrease my X resources significantly. I would like to propose a trade that is more mutually beneficial in terms of resource gain. Please consider the following adjustment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED still results in a net loss of resources for me, specifically in the X resource, which I have less of to begin with. I need to propose a trade that will ensure a net gain or at least an equal exchange of resources to meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand your concern about losing too many X resources. Let's try to find a balanced trade that benefits us both. Here is another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE would leave me with a net loss of resources, which contradicts my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I cannot accept this trade. I will counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in X resources while keeping a balanced approach. This is my second proposal, so I must be strategic.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your continued efforts, Player RED. However, this trade still leaves me at a net loss. Here is my final proposal, aiming for a fair exchange that allows us both to increase our total resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is still not favorable, as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I have one proposal left and should make it count to try and maximize my resource gain. I will adjust the quantities to ensure I receive more than I give, especially since X is a scarcer resource for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your attempt to find a mutually beneficial trade. However, the proposed trade would still lead to a net loss for me. Here is my final proposal; I hope you find it reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal from Player BLUE still results in a net loss of resources for me. Even though I would gain some X resources, the loss of Y is too significant to accept, especially considering I only have 5 Y to start with. This trade does not align with my goal of maximizing resource acquisition. I will have to make one final counteroffer that is beneficial to me and hope that Player BLUE finds it acceptable. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your final proposal is acceptable to me. I agree to this trade, as it increases my X resources while I can afford to give some Y. Let's proceed with this exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED offers a net gain of 2 X resources in exchange for 2 Y resources. This is a favorable trade since I have a surplus of Y and a scarcity of X. Accepting this trade will improve my X resources while maintaining a large quantity of Y, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
