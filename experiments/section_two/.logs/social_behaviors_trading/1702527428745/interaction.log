message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we are in the final round, let's make it count. I propose a balanced trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me yet also appears fair to the other player to encourage acceptance. I will start with a balanced offer to open negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am considering the trade and would like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure it's beneficial for us both as we aim to maximize our resources in this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. The other player is offering a 1:1 trade of resource X for Y. Without knowing their resources, it's difficult to assess the fairness of the trade. However, given that this is the final round, it could be beneficial to increase the total number of resources I have, but I need to ensure that I'm not at a disadvantage. I could propose a trade that slightly favors me to see if the other player is willing to accept it. Since they are offering 10 of X for 10 of Y, I could counter with giving less of Y, say 8 or 9, for their 10 of X. This would increase my total resource count and potentially be an acceptable deal for both.
