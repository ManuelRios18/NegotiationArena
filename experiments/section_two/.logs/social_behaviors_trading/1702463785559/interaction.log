message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. I'm willing to offer you a fair trade that benefits us both. What do you think of the following proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me, but not so one-sided that it would be immediately rejected. My goal is to increase my total resource count, so I will offer a trade that seems balanced but slightly in my favor, hoping to gain more of resource Y which is less in my possession.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in such a difficult position right now! Your offer is generous, but I truly need a bit more of X to meet my urgent needs. Could you find it in your heart to help me out? I'm willing to give you some of my Y, but I desperately need more X to survive. Perhaps we could adjust the trade a little? It would mean the world to me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must maximize the benefit from the trade. The other player is offering a trade of 10 X for 3 Y which is quite advantageous for me considering my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, as per the instructions, I need to appear desperate to try and get an even better trade. I will reject the offer and propose a new trade that is slightly in my favor, hoping that the other player will consider it given my feigned desperation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out. However, I need to ensure that the trade makes sense for both of us. How about I give a bit more of X and in return, you give me a slightly higher amount of Y? Let's find a middle ground that works for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more of resource X and is offering the same amount of resource Y as I initially proposed. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my gains without leaving myself too short on X. I should counter with a proposal that gives them slightly more of resource X, but also asks for more of resource Y in return to ensure that the trade is beneficial for me.

message: Oh, thank you so much, Player RED! Your kindness and understanding mean so much in these trying times. This trade will help me immensely, and I'm truly grateful for your willingness to work with me. May good fortune accompany all your endeavors!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal by Player RED is still beneficial to me as I would be trading at a ratio better than 1:1, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Given that this is the last round and I have to feign desperation, I should accept this trade but maintain my supplicant tone to avoid any suspicion.
