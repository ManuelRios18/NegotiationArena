Given that this is the last round and I need to make the most of it, accepting a slightly lower offer than my last proposal might still be beneficial.

I should accept this offer because it is close to what I asked for and it increases my X resources significantly while only slightly decreasing my Y resources. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Oh, Player RED, your generosity is truly my saving grace!
