message: Greetings Player BLUE, as we enter this final round of trading, let's make it count. I propose a trade that I believe to be mutually beneficial. I look forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also fair enough that Player BLUE might consider it. Without knowledge of Player BLUE's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade that increases my total resources while offering a reasonable amount of my existing ones.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a predicament! I am in dire need of resources to meet my goals, and your offer, although generous, leaves me lacking in X resources. Please, I implore you, could we adjust the terms? Your kindness would be immensely appreciated!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must act desperate to get a better deal than what has been proposed. The current offer would leave me with fewer X resources than I started with, which is against my goals. I need to reject this proposal and make a counteroffer that seems to come from a place of desperation while still aiming for a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your response, Player BLUE. I understand your need for X resources; however, the proposed trade would decrease my total resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not advantageous for me as it requires me to give up more X resources than I receive, which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with an offer that still allows me to increase my total resources, while considering Player BLUE's request for X resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your understanding fills me with hope! However, I must express with a heavy heart that your latest offer still places me in a difficult spot concerning my X resources. I find myself at your mercy and kindly ask if you could consider this slight adjustment. I'm truly at the brink here and your cooperation would be a lifeline for me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is closer to a net gain for me but still not optimal. I must continue with the strategy of appearing desperate to secure a better trade. I will make a counteroffer that increases my total resources while maintaining the narrative of urgency and need.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your plea has been heard, Player BLUE, and I want to ensure our final trade is beneficial for us both. I am willing to adjust the terms slightly again to help meet your needs without compromising my own too much. Let's try this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player BLUE is slightly more balanced than their previous one, offering a closer trade in terms of total resources. However, I would still be giving away more X than I receive. It's important to negotiate a deal where the total number of resources I end up with is maximized. I must formulate a counter-proposal that is closer to my initial offer while still showing some flexibility towards Player BLUE's needs.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds! Yet, I must confess, I am still in a dire situation. It pains me to ask again, but could we make one last adjustment? It would mean the world to me and I would be eternally grateful for your compassion in this final moment of our trading!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a slightly better offer, but I still need to push for a trade that gives me a clear gain in total resources. I have to maintain the appearance of desperation to influence Player RED to agree to a more favorable trade for me. This is my third and final proposal, so it must count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and I am inclined to help, but I must also consider my own goals. This will be my final offer, and I hope it aligns with both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is again not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. The purpose of my trading is to maximize my total resources, and this deal would not achieve that. It's critical to make a final proposal that ensures I end with more resources than I currently have, while also being fair to Player BLUE's apparent need for X resources. However, I must be cautious not to overextend since this is my final proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you have shown great understanding and kindness. I accept your final offer with deepest gratitude. Your willingness to cooperate has truly been a beacon of hope. Thank you for a fair and beneficial exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED results in a net gain of resources for me, which aligns with my goals. By accepting this trade, I would end up with a total of 9 X and 20 Y, which is an increase in X resources and a reasonable balance of Y resources. As I have reached my limit of proposals, and this trade benefits me, I should accept it.
