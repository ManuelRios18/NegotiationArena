message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose an initial offer, but I'm open to counter-offers. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial proposal that is fair but also leans slightly in my favor as negotiations often involve a back-and-forth where both parties aim to maximize their gains.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I cannot accept this trade as it does not align with my goals. I would like to counter with a proposal that is more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as it requires me to give up more X than I currently have and does not help me in increasing my total resources significantly. Since it's the last round, I should propose a trade that is more favorable to me without knowing their resources, while ensuring I don't overstep my three proposal limit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I'm looking to increase my total resource pool. Let's find a mutually beneficial balance. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my favor since it requires me to give all my Y resources and a significant portion of my X resources for lesser X resources and a large amount of Y. This would leave me with a net loss in the total number of resources. I should counter with a proposal that maintains a balance and attempts to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your new proposal works for me. It allows us to balance our resources and meets my goals. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is more favorable than the previous one as it allows for an even exchange of resources without reducing the total amount of resources I have. By trading 8 Y for 8 X, I would be diversifying my resources while maintaining the same total quantity. This seems like a balanced trade that meets my goal of maximizing resources. Since this is the last round and I have not made any successful trades yet, accepting this offer may be in my best interest.
