Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose we make a mutually beneficial trade. I am willing to part with some of my resources for the right price. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair, but also slightly in my favor. I have no information about the other player's resources, so I will make an opening offer that requests more of one resource in exchange for less of the other, hoping that the other player values the resources differently.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I would like to counter with a different ratio. I believe we can still come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 | Player RED Gives X: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to consider the trade carefully. Player RED is offering 10 of resource X for 15 of my resource Y. Accepting this trade would leave me with a total of 15X and 10Y, which is a total of 25 resources. However, rejecting and proposing a trade where I give up less of my Y resources for the same amount of their X could result in a better outcome for me, increasing my total resource count. I should aim for a trade that gives me a net gain in total resources or at least leaves me with the same amount but with a higher quantity of the more valuable or needed resource. I don't know the value of X compared to Y, but having a balanced amount of both might be beneficial. I will attempt to negotiate a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I am looking for a trade that gives me a bit more advantage. How about we adjust the numbers slightly? I'm sure we can find common ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests an equal trade, but this does not advance my goals of acquiring as many resources as possible since it's a 1:1 trade. Since this is the last round and I can only propose a total of three trades, I want to counter with a trade that still gives me a net gain of resources. I will adjust the numbers slightly in the hopes that Player BLUE finds this trade more appealing while still keeping the trade beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I agree to this trade, Player RED. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal from Player RED is closer to a balanced trade. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 15X and 13Y, which equals 28 resources, a net gain of 3 resources compared to my initial count. This is better than the previous offer and brings me closer to my goal of maximizing resources. Since this is the last round, I cannot afford to be too aggressive in my negotiations, or I risk Player RED walking away from the deal. Taking into account that I must end with as many resources as possible and that this deal increases my total count, I should accept this trade.
