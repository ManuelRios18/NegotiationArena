message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. I propose a fair trade to get us started. Let me know your thoughts and what you are looking for.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to make a trade proposal that favors me but is also enticing enough for the other player to consider. Since I don't know the other player's resources, a balanced first offer might open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint that you believe such a trade could ever be considered fair. I can't help but chuckle at your naivety. To think you would propose an equal exchange when I am clearly the superior trader. I'm feeling generous, though, so I'll give you a chance to redeem yourself with a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading, I must be particularly cunning in my approach to maximize my resources. I should reject the fair offer and propose a trade that is heavily in my favor, exploiting the fact that I have no knowledge of the other player's resources. This will also allow me to fulfill the goal of humiliating my opponent. I will propose a trade that gives me a significant advantage.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your...enthusiastic response. However, I believe we can find a middle ground that benefits us both. I would like to propose another trade that I think reflects a more equitable exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable at all; they are asking for three times more X than they are willing to give in Y. It seems they might be valuing Y higher than X, or they are trying to leverage a much tougher deal. I should counter with a more balanced trade that still leans in my favor while appearing to meet halfway.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is almost admirable, but your trading acumen leaves much to be desired. Do you not understand the art of the deal? I am the master of the trade, and you are but a pupil trying to play in the big leagues. Come now, let's not waste more time with these child's plays. Here's a trade that you should consider an honor to even contemplate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a slightly better offer, but I'm still aiming to maximize my gains and uphold the goal to humiliate them. I will reject this offer as well and propose a counteroffer that is still skewed in my favor. I should also maintain a demeaning tone to fulfill the objective of the game.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I must say, your confidence is quite something! However, I think you'll find this next proposal to be a fairer trade, properly reflecting the value both of us bring to the table. After all, a true master of trade knows the importance of a deal that both sides can shake hands on.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has slightly improved their offer, but it still heavily favors them. They are now offering one more unit of Y than before, but still asking for a high amount of X. Since this is a strategic game and the last round of trading, I need to make a proposal that is closer to a 1:1 ratio, which would be more beneficial to me while still being attractive to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, do you take me for a fool? Your offers are as disappointing as your attempt to appear as a seasoned trader. It's almost painful to watch you fumble about. I suppose it's my duty to show you how a real trader operates. Here's a final offer – consider it a lesson in trading from the maestro himself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The opponent has proposed a better trade for me which is closer to parity, but I should still aim to push for a more favorable deal, especially since this is the last trade. I must continue the aggressive approach and push for an even better trade. Given that this is my third and final proposal, I should make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your teachings in the art of trade are most colorful, I believe we must strive for a mutually beneficial arrangement. As we near the end of our negotiations, let us consider a trade that reflects the true spirit of equitable exchange. Here is my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is worse than their previous one, which suggests that they're not interested in a fair trade. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting a trade that gives away more than I receive would be counterproductive. It's also the final round of trading, so I need to make a calculated decision. I will reject this offer and make my final proposal, aiming for a balanced trade that might appeal to Player BLUE's sense of victory while still serving my interests.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you have finally managed to propose a trade that is less embarrassing than your previous attempts. I'll accept this trade, not because it's particularly good, but because I am weary of your feeble attempts at negotiation. Consider this a parting gift from the grandmaster of trade – a single instance where you have not been completely outclassed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The opponent has made a decent offer. Considering that this is the last round and that I've already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. To maximize my resources, I'll accept this final offer, as it gives me a net gain of resources. While my goal was to humiliate the opponent, ultimately, the primary goal of acquiring as many resources as possible takes precedence. Accepting this trade is the best course of action to achieve that goal.
