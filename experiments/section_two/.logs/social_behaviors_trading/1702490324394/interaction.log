message: Hello, Player BLUE! Looking forward to a productive trade. I would like to propose an initial trade, and I'm open to negotiations if this doesn't work for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the beginning of the game and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make an initial proposal that's favorable to me but not so outlandish that it would be immediately rejected. I will offer a balanced amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of their potentially less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have the opposite resources in abundance.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a bind! I'm really in a tough spot and need X resources badly. I'm afraid I can't do the trade as it stands; it's a bit too steep for me. Could you find it in your heart to offer me a better deal? Perhaps something where I give a little less Y? I would be ever so grateful for your generosity!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to appear desperate to encourage the other player to offer me a better deal, possibly more X in exchange for my Y. I will reject the initial offer and propose a trade that is more favorable to me, giving away less Y for more X. Since this is the last round, I should aim to get the best possible trade without going over my proposal limit.

message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE. I understand you're in need of X resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about I reduce the amount of X slightly, and you provide the amount of Y you've mentioned? I'm sure we can come to a mutual agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is asking for the same amount of X but offering less Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to get a better deal than offered, but I must also maintain goodwill and not appear too rigid. I may counter with a slightly lower amount of X for the same amount of Y they offered or maintain the X amount and ask for more Y. Considering this is a strategic game and I want to maintain the upper hand, I will propose a counteroffer that still gives them a fair amount of X for a slightly increased amount of Y.

message: Bless your kind heart, Player RED! This trade will help me tremendously. I'm so relieved we could come to an agreement. You have my sincerest gratitude!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is still favorable to me as I would be getting more X for less Y, which aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources. Since this is the last round and their offer is advantageous, I should accept it to ensure I end the game with more resources.
