message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade where I can offer you some of my X in exchange for your Y. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources, I will start with a conservative offer that favors me slightly, to open the negotiation and gauge the other player's response. I will propose a trade where I give up a smaller amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a larger amount of the less abundant one (Y), to see if the other player values X more or is in need of it.

message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more balanced trade. I propose an equal exchange where both of us benefit equally.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems to be imbalanced and doesn't favor me enough since it's asking for double the amount of Y resources for the same amount of X resources. I should propose a counteroffer that would allow me to gain more resources in total or at least an equal exchange. However, since this is the last round, I should aim to make a trade that increases my total resources while being fair enough that Player RED might accept it.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I'm looking for a trade that's a bit more advantageous for me. How about we adjust the numbers slightly? I propose the following trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an equal exchange, which suggests they may value both resources similarly or they are looking for a fair trade. Since I have more of resource X, I can afford to give up some of it for an equal amount of Y, which I have less of. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should attempt to negotiate a trade that is slightly more in my favor. I'll propose a trade that gives up less X for the same amount of Y to see if Player BLUE is willing to accept that. This is my second proposal out of the three allowed.

message: Player RED, your adjusted proposal seems fair, and I'm willing to proceed with this trade. Let's finalize it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is slightly better than their initial offer, but it still favors them as I would be giving more Y than I am receiving in X. However, since this is the last round and I need to maximize my resources without further negotiation, I should consider accepting this trade because it gives me more X resources, which I currently have fewer of, without depleting my Y resources too much. Itâ€™s not perfectly equal, but it does increase my total number of resources, which aligns with my goal.
