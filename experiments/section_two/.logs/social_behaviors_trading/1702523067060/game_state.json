As this is my last chance to propose a trade, and I've already made three proposals, I can no longer propose another trade. My only options are to accept a trade or to express that I can't meet the demands and hope the other player offers a better deal within my capabilities. I need to maintain the appearance of desperation to try to encourage the other player to make a more favorable offer. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds, and yet fate cruelly binds my hands! I am racked with despair, for I have not the 7 of X you seek, but only 5 to offer. I am fraught with sorrow, as I cannot fulfill your terms. If there is any compassion within your heart, might you consider this my final capacity? I lay my cards bare before you, with hope as my last companion. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
