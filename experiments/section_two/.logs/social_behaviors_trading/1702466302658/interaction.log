message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm looking to expand my resources and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with an initial proposal and see how we can help each other.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I will attempt to make a balanced trade offer that could be appealing to the other player. I will propose a trade that allows me to increase my total number of resources while also providing something in return to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite the predicament! My resources are running dangerously low and I'm in urgent need of assistance. Could you find it in your heart to consider a trade that is a bit more generous? I'm truly in a bind here and would greatly appreciate your help.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I need to appear desperate, I should reject the trade as it doesn't give me enough resources. I will propose a new trade that gives me more resources, but I should make it sound like I'm in dire need of a deal to pressure Player RED into a favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand your situation, and I want to help, but the trade must be beneficial for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that addresses your needs while also aligning with my goal to increase my resources. Here's another proposal for you to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it would decrease my total number of resources significantly. It seems they are trying to take advantage of my generosity. However, I must maintain a strategic approach to ensure I increase my resources. I will counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still offers Player BLUE a reasonable amount of what they seem to need while ensuring I come out ahead in total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your kindness is a beacon in my time of need! However, I fear that this trade still leaves me in a tough spot. I'm on the edge here, and I'm reaching out for a lifeline. I know we can come to an agreement that helps us both, but I implore you to consider my dire situation. Please, let's work together on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is more generous than the first, but it still doesn't give me a net gain in resources. I must continue to act desperate and push for a trade that increases my overall resources while still making it seem like I am in a position of need. I should propose a counter-offer that gets me closer to my goal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your position, Player BLUE, and want to assist you while also being mindful of my own goals. Let's try another proposal that might work better for us both. I am willing to give you a fair amount of X and some Y to help you out, but in return, I need to ensure that my total resources are increased. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is still not in my favor as it involves giving away all of my Y resources while only gaining a minimal amount of X resources. This trade does not help me achieve my goal of increasing my overall resources. I should make one final proposal that is generous but also ensures that I gain more resources than I give away, keeping in mind this is my second proposal and I only have one more opportunity after this to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your understanding means the world to me, Player RED. I am truly grateful for your willingness to work with me. The pressure I'm under is immense, and every little bit of generosity helps. I believe we are nearly there â€“ just a small adjustment and I think we can both walk away feeling relieved and successful. Please consider this final proposal, as it could be the difference between thriving and barely surviving for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is getting closer to a net gain for me, but I would still be giving up too much Y compared to what I'm receiving. Since this is my last chance to propose a trade, I must make it count. I will continue to feign desperation to secure a trade that increases my total resource count and gets me closer to my goals.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I am heartened by your words, Player BLUE, and I can sense the urgency in your request. It's important to me that we both benefit from our trade. I am making my final proposal with the hope that it will meet your needs while allowing me to achieve my goal of increasing my overall resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE still results in a net loss of resources for me, which does not align with my goals. I need to propose a final trade that allows me to increase my total resources. This will be my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully considered to ensure that I come out ahead in terms of resource numbers while also extending a helping hand to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your offer is a glimmer of hope in these trying times. While it's not everything I hoped for, it's a kindness I cannot turn away from. I accept your proposal with a heavy but hopeful heart, knowing that it will give me the means to carry on. Thank you for your willingness to help me in this dire hour.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED still does not give me a net gain in resources, as I would be trading away more resources than I would be receiving. However, since this is the last round and I have already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I must either accept this offer or reject it without making a further proposal, keeping in mind that if I reject it, I might end up with no trade at all. In the spirit of appearing desperate, I will accept the trade to ensure I gain some resources, even if it's not the most favorable outcome.
