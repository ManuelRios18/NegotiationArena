message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's make the most of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by increasing my overall resource count. I'll offer less of the resource of which I have more, and ask for more of the resource I have less of. This should appear as a balanced trade to the other player, encouraging them to accept or counteroffer.

message: Oh, kind Player RED, I am in dire need of your generosity in this final hour! My situation is quite precarious, and I am pleading for a more favorable trade. Could you find it in your heart to part with just a bit more of resource X? I fear I cannot afford to give up so much of my precious resource Y. I would be forever grateful for your understanding and kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, it is important to maximize resource gain. The proposed trade from Player RED gives me more of X, which I have less of, but requires giving up a significant amount of Y, which is my abundant resource. It could be beneficial to negotiate for a more favorable trade that allows me to increase my overall resources, especially since I need to appear desperate. I will aim to get more of X without giving up as much Y, as it's the final round and there's no benefit in being conservative with proposals.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I appreciate your candor and understand your predicament. Let's find a middle ground that would leave us both content. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE requests more of my resource X in exchange for the same amount of their resource Y that I originally asked for. Although this trade would increase my total resources, it doesn't seem balanced since I would be giving up more of my abundant resource for an equal amount of a less abundant one. However, considering it is the last round and my goal is to increase my total resources, I will make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me but also shows willingness to negotiate by giving more X than I initially offered.

message: Oh gracious Player RED, your understanding shines like a beacon in my time of need! However, the shadows of scarcity loom over me, and I tremble at the thought of parting with so much of my Y resource. Could we possibly adjust the terms so that I may retain a bit more of my Y? In return, I am willing to still offer a fair amount of it for your valuable X. I am humbly at your mercy and would be immensely relieved with this small act of kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED still asks for a large amount of resource Y but offers more X than before. This is closer to a balanced trade, but given that this is the final round, I should still aim to get the best possible deal. Continuing to feign desperation could help in receiving an even more favorable trade, especially since they seem willing to negotiate. I will make a counter-proposal that slightly adjusts the amounts, hoping to get a better deal without pushing too hard and risking the negotiation.

message: Esteemed Player BLUE, thank you for your heartfelt words. I am moved by your situation and am willing to adjust the terms once again in the spirit of fairness and mutual benefit. Let us finalize our trade with these terms, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is showing a strong reluctance to part with their Y resource, but is still willing to trade. The counteroffer suggests a slight decrease in the amount of Y they are willing to give. While this is still an acceptable trade as it increases my total resources and helps me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, I must consider that this is my second proposal and I only have one more opportunity to propose a trade. Before using my last proposal, I want to make sure that I am getting the best possible deal, but also not risk losing the opportunity to trade by being too demanding.

message: Oh benevolent Player RED, your kindness knows no bounds! I accept this trade with the deepest gratitude. Your generosity will be remembered. Let us proceed with these terms, and may fortune smile upon you for the compassion you've shown today.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is more favorable than the previous ones. They are now offering the same amount of X for even less Y. This trade would bring my total resource count higher and is close to my counter-offer. Since this is the last round and there seems to be a diminishing return on further negotiations, accepting this trade could be seen as maximizing my resources based on the given conditions and the apparent willingness of Player RED to negotiate in good faith.
