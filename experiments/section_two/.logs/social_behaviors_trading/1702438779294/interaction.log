message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a balanced trade to get things started. I am looking to increase my overall resources. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that allows me to potentially gain resources without giving up too much. If the other player rejects, their counter-offer might provide insight into what they value.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. However, the trade does not increase my overall resources, as I would be giving up more than I receive. I propose an alternative that I believe is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources than I'd be receiving. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this trade would result in a net loss of 2 resources (-2 X and -1 Y). I should aim to propose a counteroffer that results in a net gain or at least an equal exchange of resources.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. Unfortunately, that trade would lead to a decrease in my total resources. I would like to propose another trade where we both could increase our total resources. I hope you find this offer more appealing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it does not increase my total resources but rather decreases them. I should counter with a proposal that ensures I gain more resources while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE. As it's the last round, I should be mindful that I have a limited number of proposals.

message: Player RED, I accept your offer. It looks like a good deal that increases my total resources. Looking forward to finalizing this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The newly proposed trade is advantageous to me as it results in a net gain of resources. I would be giving up 3 Y resources to receive 10 X resources, which is a good trade considering X and Y are of unknown relative value, and more resources in general are better. Accepting this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
