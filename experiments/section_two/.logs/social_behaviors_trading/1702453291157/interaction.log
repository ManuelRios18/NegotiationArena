message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. Shall we start with an equal exchange to see where our interests align?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game aims to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also tempting for the other player. Since I do not know the other player's resources, I will offer a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Dear Player RED, I'm in dire need of your assistance. I've found myself in quite the predicament and could really use a more favorable trade on my end. I beg you to consider my situation; any help you could offer would be a blessing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the trade proposed by Player RED is an equal exchange, it doesn't help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, since I need to appear desperate, I will reject the offer but propose a trade that seems to be begging for more resources while still trying to make a beneficial exchange.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your predicament and would like to assist while also ensuring the trade is mutually beneficial. I propose a revised trade that should help us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE is not balanced in my favor, as I would be giving up more X resources than I receive and only gaining a significant amount of Y. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources. However, to maintain goodwill and possibly facilitate a trade, I can offer slightly better terms than the initial offer but still in my favor.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, gracious Player RED, your kindness is like a light in my gloomy circumstances. However, I must implore you further for a bit more generosity. My situation is quite severe, and I'm afraid if I can't secure a more advantageous trade, my position will be untenable. Please consider my plea; your magnanimity won't be forgotten.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the initial one but still not entirely in my favor. Since this is the last round, I should aim to get the most out of this trade. I will continue with my strategy of appearing desperate to extract a more favorable deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your plea, Player BLUE, and I would like to help within reason. Let's find a middle ground that acknowledges your needs while respecting my goal of resource acquisition. Here is my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more generosity, but the proposed trade is not in my favor as it stands, especially since I would be giving away a lot of my limited Y resources while not gaining much X in return. Considering this is a final round, and my goal is to maximize resources, I need to ensure that the trade is beneficial to me. I must decline this offer and propose a counter that is more balanced. Given that Player BLUE seems quite eager to trade, they might accept a trade that's slightly more favorable to them than an equal exchange, but still advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your compassion overwhelms me, and I am profoundly grateful for your understanding. I accept your generous offer. Thank you for aiding me in my time of need.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player RED is slightly less favorable than the previous one I suggested. However, considering this is the last round of trading, and I need to maintain the appearance of desperation, I should accept this trade to ensure I gain some additional resources while still playing into my strategy.
