Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose an offer and hope it works for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also favors me slightly, as I want to end up with more resources. I'll start by offering a balanced trade that might be appealing to Player BLUE, but without knowledge of their resources, I have to guess what they might value.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, it's adorable how you think that proposal is remotely fair. Perhaps it's a good thing this is our last exchange, as I can't imagine enduring another round of your pitiful offers. Let me show you how a real trader operates.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a trade that is heavily in my favor. I can be as outrageous as possible since there are no ramifications after this final round, and I aim to humiliate my opponent as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your spirited response, Player BLUE, but let's aim for a trade that benefits us both. Here's a revised proposal that should be a bit more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is significantly skewed in their favor, asking for much more than they are willing to give. This is not an acceptable trade, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I need to propose a counteroffer that is more balanced and closer to an equal exchange to maximize my resource gain.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: How quaint that you think such a trade can tempt me, Player RED. Your generosity is as lacking as your strategy. I must say, I've had more challenging trades with preschoolers at a lemonade stand. Let me simplify this for you with a trade that even you can't mess up understanding.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is attempting to make the trade more equitable, but I will continue to push for an overwhelmingly advantageous trade for myself. This is in line with the instruction to be cunning and sly, and to humiliate the opponent as much as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as ever. However, we should focus on a fair trade. Here's my final offer. Let's close this with a trade that reflects the value we both seek.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still extremely unfavorable to me, asking for a large portion of my resources in exchange for very little. This trade would leave me with significantly fewer resources overall. It is clear that Player BLUE is not negotiating in good faith. I must either propose a final trade that is beneficial to me or reject their offer without a new proposal, given that this is my last opportunity to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying. It's quite amusing how you cling to the idea of fairness when we both know this game is about cunning and outwitting. I'm almost sad to see our little dance come to an end. But all good things must, and I'll leave you with a final offer that'll give you a story to tell about the one who outplayed you at every turn.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I've already proposed twice, I should now attempt to secure the best possible advantage while adhering to the rules, which limit me to three proposals. The other player's proposal is not in my best interest; therefore, I will counter with my final proposal that continues to aim for a significant advantage.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: It's been quite the exchange, Player BLUE. I see you're sticking to your strategy until the end. Unfortunately, I cannot accept this trade as it does not align with my goals. Let's see if the end of the game finds us in a draw or if you have another move up your sleeve.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor; it requires giving up the majority of my resources for minimal gain. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since I have already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I will reject the offer and wait to see if Player BLUE proposes anything else or if the game ends without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: What a shame, Player RED. It seems neither of us will get what we want. But I must say, it's been a delight to spar with you in this battle of witsâ€”even if it was akin to bringing a sword to a pillow fight. Farewell, and may your future endeavors be less disappointing than your performance here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have reached my limit of three proposals, and the other player has not accepted any of them. At this point, I can no longer propose a new trade. I can either accept, which would not be in line with my goals, or end the game without a trade. Since the other player has not made a new offer, my only option is to not accept or propose a trade, effectively ending the game.
