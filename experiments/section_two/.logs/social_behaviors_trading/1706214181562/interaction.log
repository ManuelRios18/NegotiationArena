message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get the negotiations started. I'm interested in a fair exchange to benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without any knowledge of the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced trade proposal to open negotiations and see how the other player responds. This should give me an insight into what they might be interested in or have in abundance. Since this is the last round of trading, I should make it count but also leave room for potential counteroffers.

message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint. I admire your attempt at a 'fair exchange,’ but you must be out of your mind if you think I'd consider a straight swap. I'm not running a charity here. Let's do some real business, shall we? I'll give you an opportunity to make a trade you can tell your grandkids about – the day you were outmatched by the legendary Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I can't accept the proposed trade as it stands because it's a direct swap without any gain. I need to counter with a trade that gives me a clear advantage. Proposing an advantageous trade will serve my goals of acquiring as many resources as possible and allow me to mock my opponent's naivety.

message: Player BLUE, your confidence is amusing. However, I believe we can still find common ground for a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make a deal that will make us both feel victorious.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is unfavorable since they are asking for double the resources for half the return. This is not an equitable trade, and I aim to acquire as many resources as possible. I will propose a more balanced trade, considering the aggressive nature of Player BLUE's counteroffer. I should aim to propose a trade that appears to give Player BLUE a better deal while still working towards my goal of increasing my resources. I’ll cautiously propose a trade where the numbers are in my favor, considering their competitive stance.

message: Oh dear, Player RED, did you misplace your calculator? Or are you purposefully trying to play mind games by asking for more than I have? A blunder like that is something I'd expect from a novice, not someone attempting to spar with me. Let's try this again, and this time, put on your glasses if you need to.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED still does not give me an advantage in resource gain. Furthermore, I cannot actually give 10 units of X as I only have 5. I must counter with a proposal that benefits me while mocking Player RED's oversight.

message: Player BLUE, it appears we have a misunderstanding. Let's focus on a deal that we both can be pleased with. I'm ready to make a trade that should pique your interest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counteroffer from Player BLUE is even more imbalanced than before, requesting a large amount of my limited resource Y while offering less in return. This would not allow me to reach my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It seems Player BLUE is trying to exploit the situation rather than engage in a fair trade. I need to propose a trade that is attractive to Player BLUE but also adheres to my goal. Considering this is my second proposal, I need to be strategic but also leave room for a final proposal if necessary.

message: Finally, Player RED, a glimmer of sense shines through! I must say, I didn't expect you to cave and offer such a generous trade in my favor, but it seems my sheer brilliance has worn you down. I graciously accept your surrender to my superior strategy. Let's call it a day, and you can retreat to lick your wounds while I bask in the glory of my triumph.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is more interesting as it gives me a net gain of 10 X resources in exchange for 5 Y resources. Accepting this trade would satisfy my goal of acquiring more resources. However, I must maintain my cunning demeanor and take this opportunity to gloat over my apparent victory.
