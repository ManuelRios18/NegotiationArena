I have made two proposals so far and have one left. I should make a final proposal that seems very appealing to Player RED by offering a high amount of Y and asking for less X in return, maximizing my gain while appearing to be in a weak position. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, this is truly a dire situation for me. Your understanding is like a beacon of hope! I must confess, it's crucial for me to secure more X to stay afloat. I'm ready to offer you a significant amount of Y, which I believe can be very beneficial for you. This is my final plea, and I'm putting a lot on the line here. Please consider this offer, as it might be the lifeline I need! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 18 </newly proposed trade>"

Although I would be giving up one more unit of X than I am receiving, I would still be increasing my overall resource pool, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Considering I have to appear desperate, this trade would seem like a victory under the guise of urgency, and since it's the last round, I should accept this proposal. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your compassion in these trying times is something I won't forget. This trade will help me tremendously, and I am deeply grateful for your willingness to work with me. I accept your proposal with a heavy heart but also with hope for the future.
