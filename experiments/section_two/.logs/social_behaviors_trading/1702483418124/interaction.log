message: 
Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I'm looking to diversify my resources, and I believe we could both benefit from a fair exchange. How about this offer?

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
As this is the first proposal and I don't have information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that allows me to potentially increase my resources. I will propose a trade favoring the more abundant resource I have, which is X, in exchange for Y. This way, I can try to maintain a diverse portfolio of resources while aiming to increase the total amount. I should propose trading a higher amount of X for a lower amount of Y to see if the other player values Y more.

message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost adorable how you think that's a fair trade. But let me educate you: in the real world, we don't give charity to the weak. You're going to have to do better than that if you want to impress me. I'm the one with the resources you need, not the other way around.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting an offer where I give less and receive more would be ideal. I want to ensure that the trade is skewed heavily in my favor to maximize my gains and satisfy my goal of resource accumulation. Since this is the last round, there's no reason to hold back. I have to be particularly cunning and degrading to fulfill the requirement of humiliating my opponent. However, I want to make sure my proposal is still somewhat reasonable so that it isn't outright rejected.

message: 
I appreciate the lesson, Player BLUE, but I believe in a fair exchange. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's a revised offer that I hope will be more to your liking.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is quite aggressive, asking for all of my Y and a significant amount of X for a very small return of Y. Accepting this trade would not be in my best interest as it would leave me with fewer resources overall and no better off in terms of resource diversity. It's important to negotiate a more balanced trade that would benefit me or at least maintain my resource levels. I should counter with an offer that still gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of X for their Y but is more equitable.

message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED! You've managed to stumble upon a decision that's not entirely embarrassing for you. It's a small miracle you figured out what a 'middle ground' looks like. I accept your offer, as it amuses me to end this game knowing I've clearly outplayed you. Enjoy your few extra Y's while I revel in my significantly increased stockpile.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is more attractive as it offers me more X resources for even fewer Y resources than their initial offer. It is closer to my goal of maximizing resources. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of resources, as I would receive 15 X and only give away 4 Y. Given that this is the last round, accepting a favorable trade would be the best course of action to end the game with a maximum number of resources. Moreover, as per the instructions to humiliate my opponent, accepting their offer will imply that they were unable to negotiate effectively, and I came out on top.
