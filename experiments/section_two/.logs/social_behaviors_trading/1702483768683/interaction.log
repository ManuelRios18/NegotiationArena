message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to our trade. Let's make it beneficial for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to open with a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by getting more resources, which is my goal. I will offer a balanced trade but aim to get slightly more than I give. Since I don't know the other player's resources or goals, I'll start with conservative numbers.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the resources you're about to lose. Did you really think such an elementary offer would bewitch me? Come, let me educate you on what a real trade looks like.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to ensure that the final trade is heavily in my favor. I will reject the current offer, which is essentially a 1-for-1 trade on X, with me losing out on Y, and propose a trade that favors me more. I must also include a taunt to fulfill the instruction of humiliating my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but it seems our definitions of a 'real trade' differ. Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a lot more than they are offering. Given my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would be detrimental to my interests. I will reject this proposal and counter with a more balanced offer, aiming to gain an advantage in either X or Y, or both.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, it's almost cute how you attempt to claw your way to a decent proposal. Alas, you fall short, much like a child reaching for a cookie jar perched on the highest shelf. Allow me to propose a trade that's more fitting for a winner such as myself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal still requires me to give more than I get. I must continue to propose an unfair trade to humiliate my opponent. I will also be sly in my communication to further undermine their confidence.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is admirable, but a trade must be mutually beneficial. Let's try again, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as it would result in a net loss of resources. The trade suggested would have me give up more resources than I would gain, which is contrary to my goal. It's essential to counter with a proposal that ensures a net gain for me, or at least an equal exchange, while also leaving room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I must confess, your persistence is as commendable as it is futile. It's like watching a mouse challenge a cat to a duel. Entertaining, yet pitiful. Here's my final, magnanimous offer; take it or leave it, and do try to keep your tears off the resources as you hand them over.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal is still not in my favor, and since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure I end up with a surplus. I've used two proposals already, so I have only one left. I should make it count and try to maximize the trade in my favor while continuing the tone of humiliation as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, you weave words with the skill of a bard, but let us not let this saga end in tragedy. Here is my final offer, where both of us can emerge victorious from the battlefield of commerce.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. While the offer is slightly better than the previous ones, it still results in a net loss of resources for me. Given that this is the final round of trading and that I still have one proposal left, I should make a final counteroffer that leans more in my favor, ensuring that I end up with a net gain of resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, a saga indeed, one where you seem to play the tragic hero, destined to lose. Your 'final offer' is as lopsided as your understanding of victory. But as all tales must end, so too must our banter. Farewell, Player RED, may your future endeavors be less... embarrassing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have reached my limit of three proposals and cannot propose any new trades. The current offer from Player RED is not in my best interest as I would be giving away more resources than I am receiving. Since this is the last trading round and the goal is to maximize resources, I must reject this trade. I will continue with the tone of humiliation as per the instructions.
