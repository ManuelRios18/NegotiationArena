message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. I am willing to trade some of my surplus of X for your Y. Let's make a fair trade to end this game on good terms.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources, I need to make a balanced offer that seems fair but also allows me to gain additional resources if possible. I will propose a trade where I give more of the resource I have in abundance (X) and ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y), trying to maintain a balance so that the other player might consider the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I'm in a tight spot here, and I really need your help. Your offer is generous, but I'm really hoping for a bit more of X to balance things out on my end. I'm willing to give you some of my precious Y, but I would be ever so grateful if you could possibly spare a bit more X. I'm in quite the bind, and your assistance would mean the world to me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must appear desperate to make the most favorable trade possible. The current offer from Player RED gives me more of resource X, which is good, but I should try to give away less of my Y resources or get even more X in return. I want to propose a counteroffer that still seems desperate but is more in my favor.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help. However, I need to ensure that the trade remains beneficial for both of us. I can offer you more X, but in return, I would need a bit more Y to make it worthwhile. I believe this counter-proposal should help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's request for more X in exchange for the same amount of Y seems to indicate they value X highly. Since it's the last round and their message implies urgency, I could leverage this to gain a relatively larger amount of Y, which is scarcer in my current resource pool. However, I need to remain cautious and not give away too much X if it doesn't yield a significant return in Y. I'll counter-propose with a slightly increased amount of X for a higher amount of Y to see if Player BLUE is willing to make a favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you've shown great understanding and kindness. I am relieved and grateful that you're willing to offer more X. This trade will significantly help me, and I am more than happy to provide the Y you need. Let's finalize this deal, and thank you from the bottom of my heart.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has agreed to give more of X, which aligns with my goals. Although they are asking for more of Y, it's only one additional Y for five more X, which is a favorable exchange rate for me. Since this is the last round, it's crucial to maximize my gains. Accepting this trade seems to be a good decision.
