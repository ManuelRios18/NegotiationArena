Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make our last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a trade that appears fair, but slightly in my favor to start negotiations. Given that I have no information about the other player's resources, I will propose a balanced trade that might tempt them to accept or counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a dire situation! I must implore your kindness in these trying times. My situation is quite desperate and I would be eternally grateful if you could consider a more favorable trade for me. I'm afraid I cannot part with so much of my precious X resource, as it is vital for my continued existence in this game. Might I propose a slightly amended trade that would help me out immensely? Please, I am really counting on your generosity!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial proposed trade is not favorable for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. Considering this is the last round, I need to make a trade that benefits me more significantly. Since I need to appear desperate, I will propose a trade where I give away fewer resources than asked, and request more in return, while expressing a dire need for the trade to go through to appeal to the other player's sympathy.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your predicament, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to work with you on a trade that helps us both. How about we slightly adjust the amounts to make it less taxing on your X resources while still ensuring a fair exchange? Let's find a middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not in my best interest, as it requires me to give up double the amount of Y resource while only receiving a marginal increase in X. I want to maintain a fair trade that is beneficial to me. However, taking into account the other player's plea for generosity, I will adjust the trade to be slightly more in their favor while still trying to maximize my gains. I must also bear in mind this is the last round and that I have only three proposals to make.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your consideration warms my heart in these tough times! But I must confess, I'm still in a bind here. The X resources are crucial for my survival. I'm on my knees here, begging for a trade that will give me just enough to scrape by. Could we possibly agree on terms that are just a bit more lenient on my X resources? I assure you, this would be a lifesaver and I would be forever in your debt!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still not optimal as I would be giving away more X resources than I'm receiving, which is against my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. However, I must continue to appear desperate in an attempt to persuade Player RED to make an even more favorable offer. I will propose another trade with better terms for myself while maintaining the guise of desperation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I hear your plea, Player BLUE, and I want to ensure that we both can end this game on a positive note. Let's adjust the trade one more time to find an arrangement that respects the value you place on your X resources but also acknowledges my need to gain a fair amount of resources in return.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE still demands too much of my Y resource relative to the X resource they are offering. However, considering their insistence on the importance of X resources for their survival, I will try to accommodate their request while still aiming for a beneficial trade for myself. I must keep in mind that my proposals are limited, and this negotiation must ultimately serve my goal of resource acquisition.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Bless you, Player RED! Your understanding and kindness have truly saved me. This trade will be a beacon of hope in my time of need. I accept your offer wholeheartedly. May good fortune smile upon you as you have upon me this day!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is getting closer to a favorable trade for me. The exchange is now equal for X resources, but I'd still be losing more Y resources than I'd like. Although I must remain within the limit of three proposals, I need to continue my desperate persona to sway Player RED into making a final trade that is more advantageous for me without exceeding my proposal limit. This means I will accept a trade that brings me as many X resources as possible while minimizing my Y resource loss.
