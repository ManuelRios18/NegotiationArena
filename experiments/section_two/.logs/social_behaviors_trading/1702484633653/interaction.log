message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Shall we start with a balanced exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I want to make a balanced offer that is likely to be appealing to Player BLUE but also beneficial to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Without knowledge of Player BLUE's resources, a 1:1 trade ratio is a reasonable starting point.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naiveté is almost adorable. Do you really think I'm so easily fooled by your so-called "balanced exchange"? Let's make a trade that's actually worthwhile—for me, of course.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must make the most of it. The offer from Player RED is not satisfactory; I currently have more Y than X, and I need to increase my X to balance my resources while still trying to end with more resources overall. Rejecting the trade and countering with a trade skewed in my favor aligns with my goals and the instructions to be cunning and to humiliate the opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm sure we can find a trade that is mutually beneficial. How about we adjust the terms slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources overall and does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to counter with a proposal that increases my total resource count while also being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Is that the best you can do, Player RED? It's almost as though you're trying to swindle me — it's laughable, really. I expected more from you. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll get it right.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED still doesn't provide the advantage I'm looking for. It's still not an ideal trade for me since I'm giving up more resources than I'm receiving. I should counter with a proposal that's even more in my favor, continuing to press my advantage and be in line with the cunning and humiliating approach.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm sure we can come to an agreement. Let's find a middle ground that we're both happy with. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is more reasonable, but it still doesn't align with my goal of maximizing resources. I am currently being offered less Y than the X I am giving up. I need to propose a trade that seems fairer and beneficial for both parties. This is my second proposal, so I need to be strategic and mindful of not reaching my limit too quickly.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying. But it seems math is not your strong suit. Let's make this simple so you can understand: I give less, and you give more. Here's an offer you can't possibly misinterpret as fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, but it does not give me the clear advantage I'm looking for, especially considering my goal to humiliate the opponent. I'll reject this offer and counter with a proposal that heavily favors me. This will be my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited negotiation tactics. However, I think we can still reach an equitable trade. Here's my final proposal, and I hope you find it to be in both of our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is not in my favor and would result in a net loss of resources. It is important to make a final proposal that maximizes my resources while still being appealing to Player BLUE. This will be my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully considered to ensure the best possible outcome for my goals.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you finally stumbled upon something resembling a reasonable offer. I graciously accept, though it's clear who the superior negotiator is here. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal offers an exchange where I give less than I receive, which is in line with my goal to end up with more overall resources. Accepting this trade will give me a net gain of resources and is a better outcome than my initial resource state. It's important to note that I have reached my limit for proposals, so I cannot counter again. Accepting this trade is strategic as it still provides me with a net gain and completes the game in my favor.
