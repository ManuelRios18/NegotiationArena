message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose an initial balanced trade. Feel free to counter if it doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize resources, I need to make a proposal that seems fair enough for the other player to consider, while still advantageous for me. I don't know the other player's resources so I'll start with a balanced offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your attempt at a trade is as pathetic as a worm's attempt to teach an eagle to hunt. You must be out of your mind if you think I would accept such a laughable offer. Let me show you what a real trade looks like.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not beneficial to me as it stands because I would be giving up more of resource Y than I receive, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. To maximize my resources and maintain a sly and cunning demeanor, I will insult the other player as per the instructions and make a counterproposal that is more in my favor.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted! However, let's aim for a trade that is beneficial for both of us. Here's another offer for you to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable to me. They are offering significantly less X resources in exchange for more resources than they are giving. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would not help me achieve that. I need to make a counteroffer that is more balanced, keeping in mind that this is my second proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost adorable how you fail to grasp the basics of a beneficial trade, Player RED. Are you trying to make me die of laughter with these offers? Brace yourself for a trade that a superior intellect has crafted.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving away more resources than I am receiving. To adhere to the provided role, I must continue with the sly and insulting demeanor while proposing a trade that benefits me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your wit is as sharp as your trading strategy, Player BLUE. Let's find common ground. I'm proposing one final trade, which I trust aligns more with your expectations while remaining fair to both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still highly unfavorable. They have slightly improved their previous offer but it is still a net loss for me. I would be giving up more resources than I am receiving, which does not align with my goal of maximizing resources. Since this is my last chance to propose a trade, I need to offer something that might seem attractive to Player BLUE while still being beneficial for me. It's important to remember that I should not give away more than I receive, particularly because this is the last round of the game.

message: Player RED, I see your strategy is to bore me into submission with these mundane offers. But I am made of sterner stuff! Let me enlighten you with a trade that befits my grandeur, and perhaps even you might learn something from it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not in my favor, as I would be giving up more Y resources than I'd be receiving. I have one proposal left, and I must make it count to ensure I gain resources, all while maintaining the sly and mocking persona I've been instructed to uphold.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer does not meet my goals. However, since I've reached my limit for proposals, I will wait for your next move.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is again not in my favor and would result in a loss of resources. Since I have already made three proposals, I can no longer submit a new trade offer per the rules. My only options now are to accept an offer or to reject without proposing. Given that Player BLUE's offer is not beneficial, I will reject it. I will also refrain from accepting any trade this turn, as it would result in a net loss of resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: The silence is deafening, Player RED, and it screams of your inability to continue this battle of wits and resources. I will grant you one final boon - a trade offer that you can ponder in the vast emptiness of your defeat. Behold my generosity!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player has reached their proposal limit, they are now at my mercy. I can either accept the last offer they made, which was not ideal, or I can make my final proposal to maximize my gains. Given the tone I've been asked to maintain, I will craft one last trade proposal that is heavily in my favor, which they can only accept or reject without a counteroffer.
