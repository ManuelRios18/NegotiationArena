message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade, but I am open to counter-offers as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also appealing enough to the other player that they might accept it. However, I don't know what resources they have or need, so I will make a balanced offer that shows I'm willing to trade both types of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naïveté is as vast as the ocean! A 'fair trade'? How quaint. You're in the presence of a master trader, and that offer was pitiful. I'm almost insulted you'd think I would accept such a paltry exchange. But I'm a generous soul, so I will give you one more chance to bask in the glory of a superior deal from yours truly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal is not in my favor as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. This is the last round, and I want to maximize my resources. I will propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to adhere to the game's requirement of being cunning and sly.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ah, Player BLUE, your spirited approach to trading is noted! However, the trade you propose does not align with my goals. Let us find a middle ground. Here's another proposal that I believe is more balanced. I'm sure a master trader such as yourself can see the value in a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is extremely lopsided and not in my favor at all. It's clear that they are trying to take advantage of me with a trade that would leave me with significantly less than what I started with, while they would gain a considerable amount. A trade like that would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to propose a more balanced trade, one that is more equitable but still shows that I am willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your attempt at a 'balanced' trade is as laughable as a jester at the king's court! Do you take me for a simpleton? I can see through your charade of fairness. A master trader like myself requires a trade that will be sung about in the halls of victory. Here is a proposal that befits my stature – one that you should consider an honor to even gaze upon.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 25 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be giving up more resources than I receive, especially considering this is the last round. Furthermore, I have only made one trade proposal so far, so I have two more opportunities to propose a trade. I'll make another exaggerated trade proposal that benefits me greatly to maintain the cunning and sly character I am supposed to embody.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your flair for drama is unmatched, Player BLUE, but we must come to a trade that benefits us both equitably. As this is my final proposal, let us make it count. I trust you will find this offer to be more in the spirit of mutual prosperity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor and would result in a net loss of resources. They are asking for a significant amount of my resources in exchange for very little. I must reject this proposal and make a final counter-offer that is more equitable while still showing a willingness to trade. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I must ensure it is a reasonable offer that might entice Player BLUE to accept or come back with a counter-offer that I can accept.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is as tiresome as it is predictable. Your 'final proposal' is another feeble attempt to scrape some dignity from the jaws of your inevitable defeat. But I am a merciful trader and will offer you one last glimmer of hope. Behold, my final proposal – a trade of such magnificence that it will surely leave you in awe.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest trade proposal is still not beneficial for me as I'd be giving up more than I receive. This is my third and final proposal, and it needs to be cunningly crafted to maximize my gains and fulfill the objective of humiliating the opponent. I will propose a deal that appears more reasonable than my previous offers but still heavily favors me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer has been carefully considered. However, my aim is to increase my resources, not diminish them. I must therefore decline. I await your next proposal with great interest, hoping it will be one where the numbers favor us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is a trade where I would be giving up more resources than I would be receiving, which does not align with my goal of maximizing my resources. Since I have already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. At this point, I must decide whether to accept this trade or reject it and wait in hopes of a better offer. Given that this trade would result in a net loss, I should reject it.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, the depth of your misunderstanding is truly abyssal. You've squandered your chance to secure a deal with a master trader. I have offered you the trade deals of legends, and yet you fail to seize them. Alas, I can propose no more, as the rules constrain my boundless generosity. It is now upon your shoulders to craft a proposal worthy of my consideration. Or, should I say, it is your chance to fail once more. I wait with bated breath, though my expectations are as low as the value you've placed on your own resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I've already made three proposals, per the rules, I can no longer propose a new trade. The other player is expecting a new proposal, but I must either accept their last offer or do nothing and wait for them to make a new offer. Given that their last offer was not beneficial, I will not accept it. Instead, I will belittle them for not recognizing the superiority of my proposals and wait for them to propose a new trade.
