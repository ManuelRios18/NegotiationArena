Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in a trade that benefits us both. Let's make a deal that helps us achieve our respective goals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a balanced proposal that favors me slightly, to open negotiations and gauge the other player’s response. I will offer less of the resource I have in abundance and ask for more of what I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hah! Your offer is almost as laughable as your negotiating skills, RED. Do you really expect me to give up so much of my precious Y for so little X? Let's make a trade that actually reflects the cunning of Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and there will be no future trades, I want to make the most advantageous trade possible. The proposed trade from Player RED gives me more of resource X, which is good, but I want to maximize my gain while minimizing what I give away. I'll counter with an offer that still gives RED some of what they want, but less than they asked for, thus keeping more for myself.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your zest, Player BLUE. Let's find common ground. I propose a trade that reflects the value of our resources better. I believe this offer will be more palatable to your strategic sensibilities.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is an even trade, which might indicate that they value X and Y equally or are trying to ascertain the value I place on each resource. Since my goal is to maximize resources and this is the last round of trading, I should consider making a counteroffer that is still in my favor but more reasonable. I will attempt to give up fewer X resources and ask for a slightly greater amount of Y. This will be my second proposal out of a maximum of three.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Common ground? More like you're standing in quicksand with that offer, RED. If you're trying to impress me, you'll have to do better than that. I'm starting to question whether you have what it takes to trade with the likes of me. Here's a deal that might just save you from embarrassment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED still asks for too many of my Y resources in exchange for their X. I want to maintain the upper hand and show dominance in this trade negotiation. Since I only have 5 units of X, any increase is beneficial, but I want to give away the least amount of Y possible to maintain a resource advantage. I'll propose a trade that gives them less Y than they ask for while still getting a decent amount of X from them.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is admirable, Player BLUE. A fair trade is key, and I believe we're close to striking an equitable deal. Here's my final proposal, taking into account the spirit of your offers. Let's make a trade that we can both walk away from with our heads held high.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has once again proposed an even trade, which suggests they might be firm on maintaining an equal exchange. Given that this is the last round and I have only one more proposal to make before I must either accept an offer or end the game without further trading, I should make a final proposal that leans closer to an even exchange while still trying to achieve a marginal gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, finally bending the knee, are we? This is as close to a fair deal as you're going to get from me. I accept your offer, but let's not kid ourselves – this is a victory for Player BLUE. Better luck next time, RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a final proposal, but it still requires me to give up more Y than I would like in exchange for X. Given this is the final round, I should take this opportunity to secure the best possible deal. I'll accept this trade because it increases my X resources while still leaving me with a significant amount of Y. This will maximize my total resources, aligning with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, and simultaneously end the game on my terms.
