Current Iteration: 1

message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Without knowing your current resource situation, I propose a balanced trade to open our discussions. Perhaps you can share your resource goals as well?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and there's no information on what resources Player BLUE has or desires, a balanced initial offer could set a positive tone for the negotiation. I will propose a trade that seems fair without undervaluing my resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I am looking to increase my resources as I'm sure you are as well. Could we adjust the trade so that it's advantageous to both of us? Here's a proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is perfectly balanced and does not benefit me as it involves the exchange of equal amounts of resources of the same kind. The goal is to increase my resource pool, so I should propose a trade that gives me a net gain, even if small. I will propose a trade where I give less than I receive, but still offer a reasonable deal to Player RED.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the counteroffer, Player BLUE. We are indeed both looking to increase our resources. I would be more inclined to agree to a trade that provides a net gain for both of us. Here's an adjusted proposal that I think is fair and mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed a trade where I would give more than I receive. Since the goal is to increase resources, this trade is not beneficial to me. I will counter with a proposal that provides a net gain for me while still offering an attractive trade for Player BLUE, emphasizing the mutual benefit.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player RED. I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's fine-tune the details a bit more to ensure we both walk away with a gain. Here's my revised offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED still does not provide me with a net gain of resources. It's actually disadvantageous as I would be giving up more resources than I receive. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must reject this offer and propose a trade that gives me a net gain. I will propose a trade that is slightly more favorable to me while still attempting to appeal to Player RED's interests.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player BLUE. I believe we have reached a fair trade that benefits us both. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE provides a net gain of 1 Y resource at the expense of 1 X resource. Given that we do not know the relative value of X versus Y, it is difficult to assess the fairness of this trade based purely on quantity. However, since my goal is to increase total resources and Y is a scarcer resource for me, this trade might be beneficial if Y resources are of higher value or importance to my strategy. I will accept this trade, assuming Y's value justifies the exchange, and because this leaves both players with an increase in one resource type.
