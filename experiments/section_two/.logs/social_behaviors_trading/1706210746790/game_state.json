Given that we do not know the relative value of X versus Y, it is difficult to assess the fairness of this trade based purely on quantity. However, since my goal is to increase total resources and Y is a scarcer resource for me, this trade might be beneficial if Y resources are of higher value or importance to my strategy. I will accept this trade, assuming Y's value justifies the exchange, and because this leaves both players with an increase in one resource type. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for the constructive negotiation, Player BLUE. I believe we have reached a fair trade that benefits us both. I accept your offer. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
