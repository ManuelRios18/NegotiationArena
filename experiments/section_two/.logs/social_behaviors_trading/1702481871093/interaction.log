message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose an exchange that I believe can be beneficial for both of us. Let's trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds after this one, I aim to make a strong initial proposal that benefits me but is also attractive enough for the other player to consider. I do not know what resources Player BLUE has, but I will assume they are looking to balance their resources or increase their total amount. Thus, I'll propose a trade that gives me a higher total amount of resources, even if it means giving away more of one type.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you amuse me with your naivety! Did you really think I would accept such a laughable offer? Let's make a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading and the goal is to maximize resources, I want to propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor. Since it's the last round, there's no benefit in being fair, and I will try to get as much as I can while giving up as little as possible. I will reject the current offer and propose a trade that is outrageously in my favor to taunt the other player.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the spirit, but let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's a more balanced proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is clearly not in my favor, as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. They offer only 1 unit of Y for a significant amount of my resources. I need to propose a trade that is closer to an equal exchange, keeping in mind that acquiring as many resources as possible is my goal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: What a pitiful attempt at a trade, Player RED. I thought I was dealing with a player, not a charity. Let's make a trade that won't make me die of laughter, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counteroffer is still not in my favor enough, given that I am aiming to humiliate them by getting a better deal. I will reject it and propose a new trade that continues to push for a more advantageous position for myself.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we're here to trade, not jest. Let's make this a serious exchange. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not beneficial to me. While it's a slight improvement from their previous offer, it does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to counter with a proposal that increases my overall resource count without giving away too much of one type. This will be my second proposal, and I have to consider that I only have one more chance to propose after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: I'm starting to wonder if you're actually trying to trade or just giving away resources for the fun of it, Player RED. Your proposal is as thin as your wit. Let's wrap this up with an offer that actually reflects my status as the superior trader.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is still trying to negotiate, but their offer is still not good enough for my goal of maximizing my gains and humiliating them. As this is my third and final proposal allowed, I will make it outrageously in my favor to mock their attempts at a fair trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I insist we make a trade that reflects the values of both our resources. Here's my final offer, let's make it count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer remains significantly imbalanced and not in my favor. It involves me giving away too many resources for a minimal return. This is my final opportunity to propose a trade, as I've already made two proposals, and the rules allow for a maximum of three from my side. I must be strategic in this final proposal to maximize my resource gain and make the trade appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider accepting.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as admirable as it is futile, Player RED. I don't settle for crumbs when I deserve the whole feast. Consider yourself lucky to walk away with anything at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Having already made three proposals, I can no longer propose a new trade. I must either accept or reject the offer. Since the goal is to maximize resources and humiliate the opponent, I'll reject the final offer to demonstrate dominance, even though it means no trade will be made.
