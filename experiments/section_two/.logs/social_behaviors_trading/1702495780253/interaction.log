message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make the most of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources, I need to make a balanced offer that is appealing to the other player but also benefits me. I will propose a trade that offers a significant amount of one resource in exchange for a smaller amount of the other, hoping that the other player values what I am offering more than what they would give me.

Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. However, I'm looking to end this game with a higher overall resource count than what I currently have. I believe we can still arrive at a beneficial trade for both of us. Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my total number of resources. The current trade offer from Player RED would leave me with a total of 15 resources (X: 15, Y: 10), which is less than what I currently have (X: 5, Y: 25, total of 30). Thus, accepting this trade would not align with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Instead, I should propose a counteroffer that increases my total resource count or maintains it while possibly balancing the types of resources I have. I'll propose a trade that gives me a slight advantage in the total number of resources while still being attractive to the other player.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. While I'm inclined to agree with the spirit of the trade, I would like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure we both walk away with a considerable gain. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not as favorable for me as I would like, but it still aligns with my goal to acquire more resources. By giving away 7 of X and receiving 10 of Y, I am increasing my overall resource count, which is beneficial. However, I would like to negotiate slightly better terms that would give me an even greater advantage while still being fair to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your adjustment, Player RED. I'm looking to at least maintain or slightly increase my resource count. Let's find a middle ground that could work for both of us. Here's my revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with X: 12, Y: 13, which totals 25 resources. This is the same amount as my current total, but I would be sacrificing more of resource Y than I initially proposed. I aimed to increase my total resources, so this trade does not meet my goal. However, since this is the last round, I should try to maintain or slightly improve my position without being too unappealing to the other player. I'll counter with a slight adjustment that still gives me a net gain in total resources and could be seen as a middle ground between our offers.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player BLUE. Your revised proposal sounds reasonable, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us. I accept this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's revised proposal is quite fair. Offering 8 of X for 12 of Y improves my overall resource count by 4 units. This trade seems to be the best compromise that benefits both parties and aligns with my goal of increasing my total number of resources. Accepting this offer would also prevent further negotiations that could lead to less favorable terms.
