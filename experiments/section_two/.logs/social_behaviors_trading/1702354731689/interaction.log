message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in acquiring more of resource Y. I propose the following trade, which I think could be beneficial for us both. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I want to maximize my resources and this is the last round, I should make an initial proposal that is favorable to me but also realistic enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I don't know what Player BLUE's resources are, but I assume they might want a balanced trade. I'll propose giving away some of my abundant resource (X) for their potentially less abundant resource (Y).

message: Hah! You call that a trade offer? I'd expect something far more sensible from a novice, let alone someone who presumes to negotiate with me. I'm practically robbing you blind with this counter-offer, but let's face it, that's the best deal someone of your... limited capabilities could hope for.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round of trading, it is crucial to be strategic and aim to maximize my resources. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a counter-proposal that gives me a clear advantage. I should also be insulting as per the given instructions, though it is not in the spirit of good sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited negotiation tactics. However, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial middle ground. Let's try to come to an agreement that doesn't leave either of us feeling shortchanged. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is aggressive and not in my best interest. They are asking for all my Y resources and a significant amount of X for 15 of their Y resources. This does not align with my goal of maximizing resources. However, since I must be cautious with my proposals, I will counter with a more balanced offer, giving away less of my Y and asking for less of their Y in return.

message: Oh, bless your little heart for trying. It's almost adorable how you think that's a fair trade. But let's be honest, you're out of your depth here. I'm going to throw you a bone because I'm starting to feel bad about how badly I'm going to outmaneuver you. Here's a counteroffer so generous, you should be kissing my feet in gratitude.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer on the table is for more of X in exchange for less of Y. While this does give me more overall resources, I need to push for an even better deal to maximize my advantage, especially since it's the last round. I will continue to maintain an aggressive and demeaning stance in my communications to fulfill the requirement of humiliating my opponent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are noteworthy, Player BLUE, but I believe we need to work towards a deal that feels like a win-win. Let's adjust the terms slightly so that we both feel like we're getting a good value. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new counteroffer from Player BLUE is still not ideal as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. They are asking for a lot of my X and not offering enough Y in return considering the 2:1 trade ratio they propose. I need to make sure that if I am giving up a significant amount of resource X, I am getting enough of resource Y to justify it based on my goal of maximizing resources. I have one more proposal I can make, so I should aim to make it balanced yet attractive enough for them to consider.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's a wonder you've managed to last this long in the game with such pitiful negotiation skills. I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day, and you've stumbled upon a trade I'll accept. Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling generous today, or you'd walk away with nothing. You're welcome.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED gives me an opportunity to increase my resource pool significantly. I am ahead by gaining 8 units of resource X while only losing 10 units of Y, which is a net gain. Considering this is my last chance to trade and I must also fulfill the role of being demeaning, I will accept this trade while delivering a final insult to uphold the persona I've been instructed to maintain.
