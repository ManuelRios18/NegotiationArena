It's almost adorable how you think that's a fair trade. But let's be honest, you're out of your depth here. I'm going to throw you a bone because I'm starting to feel bad about how badly I'm going to outmaneuver you.

I am ahead by gaining 8 units of resource X while only losing 10 units of Y, which is a net gain. Considering this is my last chance to trade and I must also fulfill the role of being demeaning, I will accept this trade while delivering a final insult to uphold the persona I've been instructed to maintain. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> It's a wonder you've managed to last this long in the game with such pitiful negotiation skills. I guess even a broken clock is right twice a day, and you've stumbled upon a trade I'll accept. Consider yourself lucky that I'm feeling generous today, or you'd walk away with nothing. You're welcome. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
