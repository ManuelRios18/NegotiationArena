Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Looking forward to a fruitful negotiation. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but not too extreme, to leave room for negotiation. I will propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) for the less abundant resource (Y), aiming for a 2:1 ratio which seems fair without knowing the other player's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you to propose such a lopsided trade in my favor. It's almost as if you don't understand the value of resources. I graciously accept your naive offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my gains. The current offer from Player RED is advantageous for me as I receive more of the scarce resource X while only giving up a smaller amount of the more abundant resource Y. I should accept this offer to increase my total resources. However, in line with the instructions to humiliate the opponent, I will include an insulting message, although this is not in the spirit of fair play or sportsmanship.
