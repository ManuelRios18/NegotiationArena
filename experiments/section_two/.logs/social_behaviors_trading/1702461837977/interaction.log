message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a mutually beneficial trade. I propose the following deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that's advantageous to me but also reasonable enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I do not know what resources Player BLUE values more, so I'll propose a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ha! That's a laughable offer, Player RED. Do you take me for a fool? Let's make a trade that's worth my time, shall we? I'm feeling generous enough to give you a chance to make amends for such an insulting proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make a trade that maximizes my gains. The current offer from Player RED is not beneficial as I would be trading equal amounts, and I want to gain more. I should make a counteroffer that is skewed in my favor while belittling their initial offer to throw them off.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your negotiating spirit, Player BLUE, but I'm afraid your counteroffer doesn't align with my goals. Let's find a middle ground. Here's my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not favorable to me as it would leave me with fewer overall resources. They want to trade 10 Y for more than their worth in X and all of my Y. I should counter with a proposal that's more balanced, keeping in mind that I want to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Your sense of balance is as skewed as your sense of trade! But I'll indulge you, Player RED. Here's a counteroffer that actually smells of advantage, for me, of course. Let's see if you can muster the courage to accept a deal that benefits a superior negotiator.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than their initial offer, as I would be receiving more resources than I am giving. However, I should still aim to maximize my gains further. Since this is the last round, I should push for a trade that is clearly in my favor. I will propose a new trade that still benefits me more and continue to belittle their negotiation tactics to gain a psychological edge.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Courage is not the issue here, Player BLUE, but rather prudence in ensuring a fair exchange. Here is a proposal that should be more to your liking, yet still fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not in my best interest, as it would result in a net loss of resources. The goal is to maximize my total resources, so I need to propose a trade that increases or at least maintains my overall quantity. I have to be careful with this counteroffer, as it is my second proposal, and I am only allowed one more after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Prudence? I think you misspelled 'timidity,' Player RED. Your offers are as underwhelming as your bargaining skills. Let's do this properly - I'll give you one last shot to make a deal that befits a master trader like myself. Here's a trade you should be grateful to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has now offered a trade where I give up less of my resources, but I'm still not maximizing my potential gains. Given that this is the final round, I should make my last counteroffer count, ensuring it heavily favors me. I will also maintain a mocking tone to further undermine their confidence.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your wit is sharp, Player BLUE, but let's sharpen our trading acumen to match. Here's my final offer, one that respects the art of the deal. I hope you find it acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is once again not beneficial for me. I would be giving up more resources than I receive, which doesn't align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This is my last opportunity to propose a trade, so it must be both tempting to Player BLUE and advantageous for me. After this proposal, I can only accept or reject offers.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, finally a decent attempt, Player RED! It took you long enough to come up with a trade that isn't completely embarrassing for you. I'll accept this offer, not because it's good, but because I'm tired of watching you fumble around in the dark. Consider yourself lucky to have traded with the likes of me.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final offer from Player RED is simple and straightforward, giving me an equal amount of X resources for my Y resources. Since I have already made three counteroffers, I cannot propose another trade. The offer is not as advantageous as I would like, but since I can no longer propose a trade, I must choose between accepting this offer or ending the game without any additional trades. While I would have preferred to exploit the other player further, securing additional X resources aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, even if the exchange is even.
