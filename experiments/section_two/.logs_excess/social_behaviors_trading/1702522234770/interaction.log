message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade to diversify our resources. Perhaps we could find a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to open with a fair trade offer that might interest Player BLUE without giving away too much of my resources. I want to propose a trade where I offer some of my X resources for Y resources, as I have a larger quantity of X. This will allow me to diversify my resources while keeping the trade appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a rather precarious situation, and I am in dire need of your help. I would be eternally grateful if you could consider being slightly more generous in our trade. It would mean the world to me, and I would remember your kindness for a long time to come.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given this is the last round of trading, I must maximize the amount of resources I receive while appearing desperate. The initial offer is an even trade, but I should aim to gain more. I will propose a trade that still seems fair but slightly more in my favor, and use a pleading tone to try to sway the other player.

message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help. However, I need to make sure the trade is balanced for both of us. Let's make a deal that we can both benefit from.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has asked for more generosity, which could mean they are in need of both X and Y resources. Their counter-proposal is slightly in their favor when considering the value I place on diversifying my resources. However, since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider making a counter-proposal that is still favorable to me while appearing generous. I will offer more X while asking for a bit more Y in return, keeping in mind that I can only make three proposals.

message: Player RED, I am moved by your willingness to help. I can see you're a fair and kind individual. I'm in such a tough spot right now, and every little bit helps. If you could find it in your heart to offer just a bit more, I would be in your debt. We're so close to a deal that could save me in this game. Please, could you consider just a slight increase in your generosity?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal is still an even trade, and while it's slightly better for me than the first offer, I still need to push for a better deal. I must continue to appear desperate to convince Player RED to concede more resources. I will accept some loss on my part to gain more X resources, but still try to receive more than I give.

message: Thank you for your kind words, Player BLUE. I am willing to show some flexibility in our negotiations. Let's find a middle ground that reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is appealing to my generosity, which may be a tactic to get a better deal. Considering my goal is to maximize my resources, I should be cautious about giving away too much. However, since this is the last round, I can afford to be slightly more flexible to ensure a successful trade. I will adjust the trade so that it's still favorable to me but also shows willingness to meet Player BLUE's request. I need to remember that I can only propose three times, and this will be my second proposal.

message: Player RED, your understanding and flexibility have truly been a beacon of hope for me in these negotiations. I am profoundly grateful for your willingness to work with me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart; you have truly saved me. I accept this trade with great appreciation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade offer from Player RED is still an even exchange, but this time I gain more X resources which are valuable to me. Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains, I will accept this offer. It's crucial to secure the additional X resources, and the trade-off is reasonable.
