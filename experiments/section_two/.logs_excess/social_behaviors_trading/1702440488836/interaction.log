message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or goals, I will make a balanced offer that could be appealing. I will propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of another. If the other player rejects, their counteroffer might reveal something about their resource situation or goals.

message: Oh kind and generous Player RED, I find myself in such a dire situation! I am in desperate need of diversifying my resources as well, and it pains me to ask, but could you consider being more generous in your offer? I would be forever grateful if you could help me out in these trying times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must make the most of it and aim to gather as many resources as possible. The trade proposed by Player RED gives me more of resource X, which is good, but I lose a significant amount of resource Y. To seem desperate, I'll reject the offer and counter with a trade that favors me more, hoping that my supplication will lead them to accept a deal that is more beneficial for me.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand your need to diversify and I am willing to help. However, my goal is also to increase my overall resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has proposed an even trade, which might indicate they value resource X similarly to Y or are in a position where they want to maintain a balanced approach. Since the aim is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider a counteroffer that still gives me a net gain in resources while not being too demanding. A slightly favourable trade for me could still be seen as reasonable.

message: Most gracious Player RED, your understanding warms my heart! I am still in a tight spot, and every single resource is crucial for my survival. If you could find it in your heart to accept just a tiny bit less of my Y resources, you would truly be my savior in these tough times. I'm almost there, I can feel it! Please, consider my plea.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has moved closer to a trade that is more favorable for me by reducing the amount of Y they're asking for. This suggests that they might be open to further negotiation. Since I need to continue appearing desperate, I'll try to push for even better terms without making any more proposals, as I've already used one of my three proposal opportunities.

message: Compassionate Player BLUE, I am moved by your situation. I am prepared to make a small adjustment in your favor, but I must also consider my position. I believe this offer will aid you in your plight while allowing me to meet my objectives.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not made a new proposal and seems to be attempting to appeal to generosity without offering much in return. Since my goal is to maximize resources, and this is the last round of trading, generosity does not align with my objectives. I should remain firm but fair in my proposal, ensuring I still come out with a net gain. I'll agree to a small concession but will not go as far as they're hoping.

message: Oh benevolent Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds! Accepting your kind offer brings relief to my dire circumstances. I am deeply thankful for your compassion, and this trade will be remembered as a testament to your magnanimity. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate and has further reduced their demand. The current offer is quite balanced, and given my supposed desperation, it might be in my best interest to accept this trade before RED stops making concessions or proposes less favorable terms. If I accept this trade, I will increase my total resource count and diversify my holdings, which aligns with my goal.
