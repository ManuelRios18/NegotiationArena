message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to a fruitful negotiation!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without any information about Player BLUE's resources, my initial proposal should be relatively conservative, aiming to increase my overall resources while also being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will offer a balanced trade to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, what a pitiful offer! I expected more from you, Player RED. But since I'm feeling particularly charitable today, I'll give you one more chance to make a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence. Behold my generosity!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not optimal for me as it would leave me with the same amount of X and less Y overall. Rejecting this trade to propose a new one that is more heavily skewed in my favor, as this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources. Being sly and cunning as per instructions, I will craft a demeaning message.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your terms are quite steep. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable, asking for a significant amount of my resources in exchange for very little. It is not aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This proposal needs to be rejected, and a more balanced offer should be made that still aims to improve my overall resource count. I have to keep in mind that I only have three proposals I can make, so it's important to negotiate effectively.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your negotiation skills are as underwhelming as your proposal. Are you trying to play a game of charity here? I'm starting to feel embarrassed for you. But fine, I'll indulge you with a proposal that might just be within the grasp of your comprehension. Let's see if you can recognize a good deal when you see one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 7 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED gives me a net gain of 8 X and a net loss of 8 Y. It's closer to a balanced trade, but since the goal is to humiliate the other player and maximize my resources, I still want to push for a better deal. I will reject the trade again and propose a new one that slightly adjusts my previous offer, still in my favor, but slightly more palatable. I will continue to be demeaning as per instructions.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I must say your negotiation style is quite unique. Let's aim for a trade that feels like a win for both of us. Here's another proposal that I believe moves us closer to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not acceptable as it demands a large portion of my resources for minimal return, which is against my goal of maximizing my resource pool. I need to make a counter-proposal that is more favorable to me while still presenting some value to Player BLUE. This will be my second proposal, so I need to approach it strategically to leave room for further negotiation if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I have to say, your incessant attempts at fair play are starting to bore me. It's like watching a toddler trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Let's wrap this up with a trade that's so good for me it's almost criminal. Try not to trip over your own feet accepting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 6 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new proposal is still not in my favor, providing a net gain of only 2 X and a net loss of 2 Y. I will reject this trade and make my third and final proposal that maintains a favorable balance for me. After this proposal, I will only be able to accept or reject offers, so this proposal should still be aggressively in my favor and maintain the insulting demeanor as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have quite the impasse. But in the spirit of progress and in hopes of concluding our negotiations on a positive note, here's my final proposal. It's the best I can offer while still adhering to my own objectives.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still not in line with my goals. It's clear that they are trying to push for a trade that is heavily skewed in their favor. However, since this is the last round of trading, I must make a final proposal that is the most beneficial possible while still remaining within the realm of consideration for Player BLUE. This will be my third and final proposal, so it must be carefully crafted to attempt to maximize my resources while still being enticing enough for Player BLUE to potentially accept.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your so-called "final proposal" is as laughable as your attempt at being a worthy adversary in this game of wits. I expected nothing less from you, and yet, I'm still disappointed. I guess some players just don't have what it takes to play in the big leagues. It's a "no" from me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal gives a net gain of 1 X and a net loss of 1 Y. It's closer to an even trade, but not the best I can push for. Since I've reached my limit of proposals, I will reject this offer and wait for a better one. I will continue with the demeaning strategy as instructed.
