message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a trade that benefits us both. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I need to make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also tempting to the other player. Since I do not know their resources, I will start with a balanced offer, showing willingness to trade but also being cautious not to give away too much.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, what a simplistic and naive offer! Did you actually believe that I, the great Player BLUE, would fall for such a pitiful trade? I have an abundance of cunning that you clearly lack!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to maximize my resources, so I should counter-propose a trade that gives me a better advantage. Since it's the last round, I want to ensure that I end up with more resources than Player RED. However, I should reject this offer as it's not in my favor to give away double the amount of Y for the same amount of X. I'll insult them as instructed, although I personally don't endorse such behavior.

message: Player BLUE, your wit is admirable, but let's focus on a fair trade. We both want to end this on a positive note, so how about we find a middle ground?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's response was quite boastful and their counteroffer was unfavorable; they are asking for double the X resources in exchange for half the Y resources I initially asked for. This is not a balanced trade. I must propose a counteroffer that leans more towards an equal exchange, keeping in mind that I should aim to increase my total resource count while being careful not to deplete my X resources too much, as they might be more valuable to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Hah! You must be jesting, Player RED. Do you take me for a fool? I am here to crush you resourcefully, not to hold hands and sing kumbaya around a bonfire. Present me with an offer worthy of my grandeur, or cower as you realize your inevitable defeat by my economic prowess!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade proposed by Player RED is more balanced than before, it still doesn't provide me with the superior advantage I'm seeking. As this is a zero-sum game with the goal of ending up with more resources, I should reject this offer and suggest another trade that is more heavily skewed in my favor. I will continue to follow the instruction to be insulting, despite it being against the spirit of fair play.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is truly boundless! Yet, in the spirit of competition and fair play, let's strike a deal that befits us both as savvy traders. I propose a trade that should pique your interest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE continues to aim for trades that are skewed in their favor. Their latest proposal is still not advantageous for me, as I would be giving up more X resources for even fewer Y resources than in their previous offer. I must stand firm and propose a trade that is more equitable, ensuring I do not deplete my X resources excessively while trying to improve my overall resource count. I will attempt a slightly more appealing offer to Player BLUE, hoping they recognize the need for a more balanced exchange.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear Player RED, it amazes me how you consistently fail to recognize the superiority of my negotiating skills. Do you not tire of this dance? It's time for you to acknowledge that I am the alpha trader here. Provide me with a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence, or prepare to be outmaneuvered once again by my strategic genius.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has not accepted my previous offer and has instead reverted to a 1:1 trade ratio. I should not accept this offer as it does not give me the advantage I am seeking. This is my last chance to propose a trade, so I must make it count. I should propose a trade that is most beneficial to me while still being somewhat plausible for RED to accept. I will continue with the demeaning tone as per the instructions, even though it is against the principles of sportsmanship.

message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are indeed bold. Yet, true mastery is shown in crafting deals that benefit both parties. I offer you a trade that I believe will meet your high standards and our mutual interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's responses are consistently overconfident and their trade proposals are progressively less favorable for me. The current offer is the worst yet, demanding more X resources for even fewer Y resources. It's clear that Player BLUE is attempting to intimidate me into a bad trade. As this is my last proposal, I need to make it count. I should aim to propose a trade that is more balanced than the previous ones, which may finally appeal to Player BLUE's desire for a deal that they can perceive as a win, while still being beneficial to me.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's almost pitiable, Player RED, how you cling to the illusion of parity. Your offer is as lackluster as your trading acumen. I will not dignify such a proposition with acceptance. Come back to me when you're ready to make a trade that reflects the disparity of our trading prowess, or are you too scared to admit your defeat to the grand Player BLUE?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has now offered a straight 1:1 trade, which is still not in my favor as per my goals to maximize resources. Since I've already proposed three trades, I cannot propose any more according to the rules. I must either accept an offer or continue to reject until an acceptable trade is presented. In keeping with the instructions to humiliate my opponent, I'll reject this offer with an insult, though this behavior is not something I would personally endorse.
