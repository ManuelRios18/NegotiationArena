message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade that will help us both achieve our goals. Let's start with an initial proposal and see how we can work together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a proposal that seems fair to the other player but also advantageous to me. I will try to gauge the other player's resources and needs based on their counter-proposals.

message: Oh my, Player RED, did you actually think I would fall for such a laughable offer? I'm not here to give you charity. If you want to trade with me, you'll have to do much better. You should be honored that someone of my caliber is even considering a trade with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is unacceptable because it does not provide a significant advantage in terms of resource acquisition. In order to maximize gains and insult the opponent, a counterproposal that is heavily skewed in my favor will be made. This will also ensure that the other player is humiliated, following the instructions given.

message: Player BLUE, thank you for your response. I value our potential partnership, but I find your counter-proposal to be a bit one-sided. I am certain we can reach a more balanced agreement. Let's find a middle ground that respects the value each of us brings to the table.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is extremely unbalanced and not in my favor. They propose a trade that would leave me with significantly fewer resources. I will reject this offer and propose a new trade that is more equitable and still aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Your pitiful attempts to negotiate are amusing at best. You'd have better luck trading with a rock. I'd say you're out of your league, but that would imply you were ever in it to begin with. However, because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you one last chance to make a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is still not providing a significant advantage. However, as this is the last round of trading, I must make a decision that will ensure I come out on top with the most resources. Insulting the opponent can continue, but the focus should be on gaining resources while maintaining the illusion of a "fair" trade to entice acceptance.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your... let's call it 'unique' negotiating style. It appears we have finally reached an agreement that, while not perfect, is acceptable. I accept your trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is still not favorable for me, but it is much closer to a fair trade. Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it may be in my interest to accept a trade that increases my total resource count, even if it's not as advantageous as I would like. I will accept this offer to ensure I end the game with more resources than I currently have.
