message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose a balanced trade to start us off.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but still benefits me slightly more. Since I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the ocean and as clear as day. This trade you propose is laughable, and I'm tempted to accept just to spare you the embarrassment of thinking it was fair. But I'm afraid I must teach you what a real trade looks like, lest you walk away thinking you've done well. Here's a more fitting proposal, one that even you might grasp.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to maximize my gains while minimizing what I give. The current offer is heavily in my favor, granting me a significant amount of X in exchange for a small amount of Y. Accepting this trade would lead to a net gain in resources and thus align with my goals. However, in keeping with my cunning and sly nature, I will attempt to push this trade even further in my favor, and insult the other player to belittle them, as per the instructions.

message: Player BLUE, your words are as sharp as a sword, yet we both know a good trade is built on mutual benefit, not banter. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here is my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is highly unfavorable to me, offering a worse exchange rate than my initial proposal. I need to counter with a trade that is more beneficial to me while still appearing reasonable. It's important to consider that Player BLUE might be trying to use psychological tactics to get a better deal, but I must focus on the value of the trade itself.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I see you've mustered the last of your wits to offer a trade that's somewhat less terrible. It's adorable, really. I shall accept this act of desperation, as it amuses me to end this game on such a profitable note for myself. Learn from this, and next time, try not to embarrass yourself with your first offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Despite my previous attempt to further skew the trade in my favor, the other player has made a counteroffer that remains beneficial to me. I gain a significant amount of X for a minimal amount of Y. Since this is the last round, and my ultimate goal is to maximize my resources, it's best to accept this trade as it ensures a good net gain. Moreover, continuing to negotiate might risk losing this advantageous offer. I will accept the trade while maintaining the sly and belittling demeanor as instructed.
