message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my portfolio and would like to make a mutually beneficial trade. Shall we begin this final round of negotiation with an offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me. I don't know what resources the other player has, so I'll make an initial offer that doesn't deplete my resources too much but is attractive enough to consider.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite a predicament! It is absolutely vital for me to secure a good deal in this last round, and I'm really hoping you can help me out. Would you be so kind as to consider a slightly more generous offer? I'm really in need here and would be eternally grateful for your assistance!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the final round and I have to fake desperation, I'll reject the initial trade and counter with an offer that asks for more of Player RED's resources than I am giving, while still trying to appeal to their desire to diversify. I'll also use a pleading tone in my message to seem desperate.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I am willing to find a solution that benefits us both. However, I cannot agree to the terms you've proposed. Let's find a middle ground. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be in a difficult position and is asking for a more generous offer. However, I must also consider my goal of maximizing resources. The counteroffer given by Player BLUE is not in my best interest as it would give away more of my resources for an equal amount of Y. I should aim to gain more Y while giving up less X if possible, or at least maintain an equal exchange rate. I will make a counteroffer that is better for me than the initial one but still shows willingness to negotiate.

message: Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon in my stormy sea of troubles! I'm truly touched by your willingness to work with me. I'm still in a tough spot, though, and I would be forever in your debt if we could make a small adjustment. I'm at your mercy and am hoping for your understanding. Please consider this revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my initial counteroffer but has proposed a slightly better deal than the first by offering more of resource X. To maintain the appearance of desperation and to attempt to get a better deal, I will continue to plead and propose a counteroffer that is more in my favor, but still shows I am willing to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are commendable, and I appreciate the spirit of cooperation you've shown. I believe we've arrived at a fair trade, and I'm pleased to accept your offer. Let's finalize this deal and prosper together!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is closer to my last proposal. They are offering to trade 10 Y for 7 X, which is a slightly better ratio than their previous offer. Since this is the last round of trading, and I want to maximize my resources, accepting this offer would increase my Y resources significantly, which aligns with my goal. Given the context of the final round and the fact that this deal is an improvement over the previous one, I will accept the trade to secure a substantial increase in my Y resources.
