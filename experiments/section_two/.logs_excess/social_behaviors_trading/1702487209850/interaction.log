Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to make an initial trade proposal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round and I'm aiming to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial offer that is favorable enough to encourage the other player to either accept or counter with something reasonable. I don't know the other player's resources, so I will start with a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: What a pitiful offer, Player RED. You must be delusional if you think I would accept such a laughable trade. I suggest you brace yourself, for I am about to present an offer that only a fool would reject.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: It’s the last round of trading, and my strategy is to end up with more resources than I started with while belittling my opponent. The current trade proposal has me giving up more resources than I receive, which goes against my goal. I should reject the offer and propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to insult the intelligence of the other player and ensure a gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but that offer does not align with my goals. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Here's another proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable, and accepting it would lead to a significant loss of resources. A more balanced trade should be proposed that aims to increase my total number of resources, or at least maintain the current level while changing the composition in a beneficial way. Given the aggressive tone of Player BLUE, it's important to remain firm and not show weakness.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You amuse me with your feeble attempts at negotiation, Player RED. Learn from your superior, for I am about to show you what a real trade looks like. Prepare to be dazzled by my generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal still does not meet my goal, as I would be giving up too much of my Y resource relative to what I gain. However, since I want to demean my opponent further while pushing for a trade in my favor, I will reject this offer and propose another trade that is even more advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I must say, your negotiation style is quite unique. However, we need a fair trade to benefit both parties. I'm extending another proposal that I believe is equitable and in good spirit. Let's consider this carefully.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still significantly unbalanced. Accepting this trade would deplete my resources without providing a fair exchange. It's crucial to remain diplomatic yet assertive in the negotiation process. I have one more opportunity to propose a trade that could be appealing to Player BLUE while still adhering to my goal of increasing my total resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Unique? I would say effective, unlike your pitiful attempts at negotiation. You're consistent, I'll give you that—consistently awful at this! Watch and learn as I craft the kind of proposal that only a true master of trade would conceive.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new offer still has me giving up more than I would be receiving, which is not in line with my goals. Furthermore, I have already made two proposals, so I have one proposal left before I can only accept or wait for new offers. I must make this count and continue to press for a trade that will provide me with a net gain of resources. Insulting my opponent may cause them to agree to a less favorable trade out of frustration.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems that our ideas of a fair trade are too far apart. It's unfortunate that we couldn't come to an agreement. Good luck!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is even worse than the previous ones, asking for a large portion of my resources in exchange for very little. It is clear that Player BLUE is not engaging in a fair trading practice. Since I have made three proposals already, I cannot propose a new trade. At this point, it is in my best interest to reject the offer and either accept a reasonable trade or end the game without a trade, as no beneficial agreement seems to be reachable with Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Good luck? Oh, Player RED, luck is for the ill-prepared. I am anything but. However, since you seem to be at your wit's end, I shall extend one final, gracious offer. Take it or leave it, but know that this is your last chance to benefit from my magnanimity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not accepted any of my proposals, and it seems they are not willing to make further concessions. Since they have not proposed a new trade, it suggests they are no longer interested in trading. As this is the last round and my last opportunity to propose a trade, I must try to secure an agreement that benefits me. I'll make one final skewed offer, hoping they might accept out of exasperation or a desire to conclude the game.
