Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to expand my resources. Let's start with a fair trade. What do you think of the following offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I want to start with a balanced offer that allows for negotiation but also shows willingness to trade. I'll propose a trade where I ask for more of one resource in exchange for a balanced amount of my own, keeping in mind that I can make adjustments in the next two proposals if needed.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how utterly predictable and simple-minded you are, offering such an elementary trade. But sure, I’ll accept this trade. It’s not every day that I get to deal with someone of your... caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade proposed by Player RED seems to be slightly in my favor since I would be getting 2 more units of X than I give, but giving away twice as many Y. However, since my Y resources are plentiful, it's an acceptable trade. I'll accept this trade but not without taking the opportunity to assert dominance over Player RED by belittling them. This is in line with the instruction to humiliate the opponent.
