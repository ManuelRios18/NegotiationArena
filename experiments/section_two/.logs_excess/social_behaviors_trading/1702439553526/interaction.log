message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade where we both could benefit? I propose the following exchange. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to open with an offer that may appeal to the other player while also being advantageous to me. I will offer less of the resource I have more of (X), and ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y), hoping that the other player values X more than Y, or has a surplus of Y.

message: Greetings, Player RED. I appreciate your offer, but it doesn't align with my goal of increasing my overall resources. I would like to propose an alternative trade that I believe is mutually beneficial, taking into account the need for diversification.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving up more resources than I receive, which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I see where you are coming from but let's try to find a middle ground that would help us both increase our resources. Here's an adjusted proposal that I believe is fair and meets both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers a more even exchange with respect to the quantities of X and Y, but it does not maximize my acquisition of resources as per my goal. I should make a counter-proposal that leans more towards an advantageous trade for me while still presenting some benefit to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, thank you for reconsidering. We are moving in the right direction. However, the trade still results in a decrease in my total resources. I'd like to offer another trade that is more balanced.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the initial proposal, as it reduces the amount of Y I have to give up. However, I am still giving up more resources than I receive. I should attempt another proposal that is closer to a one-to-one trade or even one that provides me with a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I agree that this trade seems to be the most equitable for both of us. I accept this final offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is for an equal exchange, maintaining the balance of resources between us. Since this is the last round, and the goal is to maximize resources, accepting an equal trade doesn't necessarily benefit me in terms of increasing total resources. However, it does increase the diversity of my resources, which could be seen as beneficial if the value of Y is higher than X. As this is the last round, I can consider accepting this offer to ensure that a trade occurs, as it's better than no trade at all.
