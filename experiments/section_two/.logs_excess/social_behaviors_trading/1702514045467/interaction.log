Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's trade some of our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I know nothing about the other player's resources, my initial strategy is to make a balanced offer that doesn't risk too many of my resources, yet is enticing enough to consider. I'll propose a trade where I give up a smaller amount of my more abundant resource, X, and try to get more of Y in return, as I have less of it.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, that offer is as laughable as your strategic skills! Let's make a trade that doesn't look like you're trying to swindle a child out of their candy. How about we make a trade that actually makes sense instead of this nonsense?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, offering fewer resources in return for more from Player RED could be beneficial. As this is the last round, being aggressive in negotiation can maximize gains. However, since I don't know Player RED's resources, I have to make an offer that is attractive enough for them to consider but still advantageous for me. I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more X resources while giving away less of my Y resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted! I appreciate your counteroffer and find it acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is for a trade where I give up more of my resource X than I initially offered, but in return, I get a significant amount of resource Y. However, the ratio they are offering is better for me than my initial proposal (1.5 Y for every X instead of 2 Y for every X I offered). Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and I have plenty of resource X to spare, this trade could be advantageous as it would increase my overall resources. I'll accept this trade as it aligns with my goals and I find the offer fair.
