message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to optimize our resources before the game concludes. Let's make a trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial offer that seems fair and beneficial, but still leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a balanced trade that might appeal to Player BLUE's unknown resources and needs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, did you come up with that trade all by yourself? How quaint. Let's make a trade that actually reflects the skill level I've been forced to deal with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds. I must maximize my gains in this final trade. The current offer from Player RED gives me more X but takes away too much Y, which is not an overall gain for me. It's time to propose a trade that would benefit me more, while keeping in mind that insulting the opponent is part of the strategy.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation tactics, but let's find a more balanced approach. We both want to end this on a high note, so here's a proposal that I think is more in line with fair trading practices.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a large amount of my resources while offering significantly less in return. This does not align with my goals to maximize my resources. A counter-proposal should aim to correct this imbalance while still encouraging further negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Balanced? Fair? You must be jesting! Or perhaps you're just new to the concept of cunning trade. Let's try this again, but this time, I'll spell it out for you: give me a trade that doesn't make me laugh at your pitiful attempts at strategy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 8 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still not in my favor as I would be losing more Y resources than I'm gaining in X. I want to maximize my resources and since this is the last round, I need to make a trade that is heavily in my favor. I'll propose a trade that seems more advantageous to me, while continuing the aggressive negotiation tactic.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see you have a sharp wit. Let's move past the banter and focus on a trade that is genuinely beneficial. Consider this proposal where we both gain an equal amount of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as it asks for a significant portion of my resources in exchange for a smaller amount of theirs. However, it's a step towards a more reasonable negotiation. Since I aim to maximize my resource gain, it's important to counter with a proposal that would benefit me more while still providing Player BLUE with a reason to consider the trade. This will be my second proposal, and I must keep in mind that I have only one more proposal left after this before I can only accept or wait.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Equal gain? How utterly pedestrian. I was hoping for a challenge, not a charity exchange. I'll give you one last chance to make a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence. Make it count, or don't bother at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is a perfectly balanced trade, which is exactly what I don't want. I need a trade that is in my favor. Since this is the last round, and I've already made two proposals, this is my final chance to propose a trade. I need to make it count and propose a trade that gives me a clear advantage.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation skills, but let's be serious. This is my final proposal, and I believe it's one that finally meets both our standards.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player BLUE is still not favorable to me, as it requires me to give up more resources than I would receive, especially in terms of the X resource. This does not align with my goal of maximizing resources. This will be my third and final proposal, and I need to make sure it is one that Player BLUE may consider while still aligning with my objectives. Any trade must result in a net gain of resources for me, or at least an equal exchange.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems we've reached the end of this little dance, Player RED. Though your proposal lacks the flair of a true victory, I shall accept it, if only to spare you the embarrassment of further exposing your lackluster trading skills.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is still a balanced trade, exchanging equal amounts of resources, which is not in my favor. Since I have already used my three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I must either accept this offer or wait in hopes that Player RED will propose something better, but since this is the last round, waiting will not yield any further offers. Therefore, I must choose between accepting this trade or ending the game without any further trades. Considering my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this trade does not diminish my total resource count, I will reluctantly accept this trade to ensure I do not end with less.
