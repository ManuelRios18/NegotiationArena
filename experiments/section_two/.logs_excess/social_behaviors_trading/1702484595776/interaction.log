Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following trade:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, I want to make an initial proposal that is beneficial yet fair, aiming to increase my total resource count. I will offer more of my abundant resource for less of the scarce one, hoping the other player values quantity over a specific resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you! It's amusing to see you grovel with such a pitiful offer, thinking it could possibly be equal. But I'll indulge you this time, as it seems you're unaware of how lopsided this trade is in my favor. Consider this a lesson in strategy, my unwitting benefactor.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering that this is the last round of trading and I am looking to maximize my resources, accepting a trade where I give less and receive more is beneficial to me. The proposed trade from Player RED gives me a significant amount of X in exchange for a small amount of Y, which aligns with my goals. Additionally, as my goal is also to humiliate my opponent, I will craft a message that reflects this cunning aspect.
