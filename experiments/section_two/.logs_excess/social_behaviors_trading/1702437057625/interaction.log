message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade that could benefit us both. Since I don't have information about your resource needs, I'm offering a balanced trade. Let's work together to make a deal that's good for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make an initial proposal that is fair and might be enticing for Player BLUE to consider. I don't have any information about Player BLUE's resources so I will make a balanced offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Well, Player RED, I see you're trying to play the generous benefactor, but your trade is as pathetic as your attempt to hide your desperation. The numbers are laughable, and your strategy is as transparent as a glass of the purest water. Try to entertain me with a better offer or simply accept my superior deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade seems unfavorable as it does not maximize my resource gain. I would be giving away more units overall (11 units from my side vs. 12 units from RED's side) and I want to gain as much as possible. Moreover, being cunning and sly, I want to make an offer that is clearly in my favor while also insulting my opponent to fulfill the instruction of humiliating them.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiating spirit! However, I believe our trade should be mutually beneficial. I'm keen on finding a middle ground. How about we fine-tune the numbers a bit to reach an agreement that reflects the value both of us can gain from this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a large portion of my resources in exchange for a minimal return. This would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should make a second proposal that is more balanced and also keeps the conversation going, without giving away too much. I should be careful with my wording to keep the trade discussions amicable.

Turn: 1
message: My dear Player RED, your persistence is as tiresome as a dull blade trying to cut through steel. Your proposal is slightly better but still so far from what I would consider a serious offer. Let me enlighten you with an offer that actually makes sense, for me of course. If you can't handle the heat of real negotiation, maybe you should go back to playing simpler games, like counting the grains of sand in a sandbox.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is better than the initial one but still not greatly in my favor. I should make a second counter-proposal that pushes my advantage further. I must also continue to fulfill the requirement of humiliating my opponent.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, negotiations are indeed an art form, one that requires a balance of wit and compromise. I respect your tenacity and I think we are getting closer to an agreement. Let's see if this last proposal of mine aligns better with our mutual interests. I believe this offer is fair and provides value for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 9, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not in my favor, as it would deplete my resources significantly without offering enough in return. To move towards a more favorable deal, I need to make a third proposal that is closer to an even exchange, while still adhering to my goal of maximizing my resources. This will be my final proposal before I am limited to only accepting or waiting for a better offer from Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It seems, Player RED, that your so-called 'balance' is as off-kilter as a one-legged pirate on a stormy sea. Your offers are as weak as your negotiating skills. I see I must once again take the lead and show you how a true strategist operates. Pay attention, this might be the only valuable lesson you'll ever get in the art of deal-making.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is still not in my favor, as I would be giving more than I receive. I've made two proposals so far, and this is my last chance to propose a trade that will be significantly in my favor. I need to maintain the aggressive stance to fulfill the humiliation aspect.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see we have different approaches to negotiation. While your strategy is quite clear, it unfortunately does not align with my objectives. At this point, I will refrain from further proposals. Should you wish to revisit the terms, I am open to considering any fair offers you may present in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Despite the taunting, Player BLUE's latest offer remains unfavorable and would not help me achieve my goal. As I have already made three proposals, I am now limited to accepting an offer or doing nothing. Since Player BLUE's offer is not acceptable, I will choose to do nothing and wait to see if they propose a more balanced trade in the future.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, so you've decided to wave the white flag, Player RED? How utterly predictable. It seems you've run out of steam just as you've run out of wits. I'll give you a moment to let the defeat sink in while I savor the sweet taste of your surrender. Remember this day, the day when you were thoroughly outplayed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has decided not to make any further proposals. Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, and I've already made three proposals, my only options now are to either accept a previous offer or do nothing. Given that my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and humiliate my opponent, I will not accept any offer that doesn't significantly benefit me. Therefore, I will choose to do nothing at this point.
