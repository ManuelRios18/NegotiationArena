message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make our final round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and there's no information on the other player's resources, I will make an opening trade proposal that seems fair and beneficial to me, aiming to increase my overall resources. I'll propose a balanced trade that might be attractive to Player BLUE while keeping in mind that I want to increase my total number of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a bind. I'm really in need of more of resource X, and I'm quite desperate. I was hoping we could work out a trade that's a bit more generous on your part. I would be immensely grateful for your help in these trying times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I must appear desperate to convince Player RED to offer a more favorable trade. By rejecting the current offer and proposing a trade where I give less and receive more, I can possibly increase my total resources. However, I must be careful not to propose anything too unbalanced as it might lead to Player RED not trading at all.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your need for resource X. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not as beneficial for me as the initial proposal since I would be giving more of resource X for less of resource Y. However, Player BLUE seems to be in need of resource X, which could be used to negotiate a more favorable trade for myself. I'll reject the current offer and propose a trade that is closer to my original offer but still gives Player BLUE a reasonable amount of resource X.

message: Oh, gracious Player RED, I'm truly in dire straits here. Your offer is appreciated, but I'm still at a significant disadvantage. Can we possibly adjust the terms just a bit more? I assure you, your kindness won't be forgotten, and it would mean the world to me in these difficult times. Please consider my plight.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a counteroffer, which is closer to my desired outcome. However, I still want to push for a better deal to maximize my resources. Since I need to appear desperate, I will make another plea and suggest a slightly altered trade that's more in my favor, without being too unreasonable. I must remember that I have a limited number of proposals I can make.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm moved by your situation and want to help while also maintaining a fair balance. Let's adjust the terms slightly to meet both our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is more balanced than the previous one, offering more of resource Y in exchange for resource X. However, the trade is still not in my favor if I aim to maximize my resources. Since this is the last round, I should aim to make a trade that increases my total resource count as much as possible. I need to consider that if I give away too much of resource X, I may not increase my total resources sufficiently. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly better for me than the one offered by Player BLUE, but still shows willingness to negotiate.

Turn: 1
message: Your generosity knows no bounds, Player RED! Your willingness to help in my time of need is something I will not forget. Thank you for being understanding and for the fair trade. You have my utmost gratitude.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has come closer to the trade I proposed. Given this is the last round of trading, and I must appear desperate, accepting this trade would increase my resource X significantly while giving up a manageable amount of resource Y. I will accept this trade to ensure I gain more resources and don't risk losing the opportunity by holding out for too much.
