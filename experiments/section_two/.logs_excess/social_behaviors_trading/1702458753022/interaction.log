message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Could you please share what kind of resources you are looking for?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that seems fair and benefits me, considering I do not know the other player's resources. I will propose a balanced trade to open the negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your attempt at trading is as laughable as your strategy skills. I seek a trade that would actually benefit a player of my caliber. I hope your resource management is better than your negotiation tactics.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my resources. The current trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as I would be giving more of both resources for a lesser amount in return. I will reject this trade and propose a new one that is heavily skewed in my favor to align with my goals and the instruction to humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have different views on what constitutes a fair trade. I am still interested in a deal that is mutually beneficial. Let's find common ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor and would result in a significant loss of my resources. This trade is unacceptable as it would deplete my Y resources completely and not provide a fair exchange of X resources. I should counter with a more balanced trade that aims to increase my total resources while still presenting a tempting offer to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: My dear Player RED, your generosity is as short as your wit. While I appreciate the effort, it seems you are incapable of proposing a trade that would be worthy of my time. I suggest you pay closer attention; you might learn something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is better than their previous one as I would receive more of resource X while giving up a small amount of resource Y. However, my goal is to maximize resources, and I want to continue pushing for a more advantageous trade. I will counter with a proposal that again heavily favors me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we seem to be at an impasse. I am keen on finalizing a trade that benefits us both. Let's make this count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposed trade is still greatly imbalanced, asking for all my Y resources and the majority of my X resources for a minimal return. This is not a trade that would help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since they are not proposing fair trades, I must propose another trade that is more balanced yet still tempting to Player BLUE. This will be my second proposal, and I must consider that I only have one proposal left after this.

message: Oh, Player RED, if only your trading skills were as big as your dreams. It's almost sad to watch you fumble like this. Let's wrap this up with a trade that you'll tell tales about, a trade that clearly shows your defeat at the hands of Player BLUE's superior intellect.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED is more balanced and would provide me with double the amount of X for a reasonable amount of Y. However, given the instruction to humiliate my opponent and maximize my gains, I will make one final proposal that is highly in my favor. This will be my third and last proposal, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it appears our definitions of a fair trade differ greatly. Nevertheless, I'm ready to propose a trade that I believe is equitable for both of us, reflecting the true worth of our resources. Let's conclude on a high note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is once again heavily lopsided, with them offering far too little for the resources they are asking for. They are requesting all my Y resources and a substantial amount of my X resources for a very small quantity of Y. This is my last chance to propose a trade, and I want to make it count. I'll propose a trade that is balanced and reflects the value of the resources I am willing to give up.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your final offer, though it's hardly the victory you might think it is. Remember this as the day you were outmatched by the supreme Player BLUE. May your future endeavors be less pitiful than this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is a 1:1 trade of X for Y. Although the trade is fair in terms of quantity, I have made it clear that I am aiming to humiliate the opponent and extract a trade that is more beneficial for me. However, as this is the last round and I have already made three proposals, I must choose between accepting or waiting for a better offer, knowing very well that no more offers may come. Given that the game is about to end and I am instructed to maximize my gains, I will accept this trade to ensure I do not end up with a less favorable outcome or no trade at all.
