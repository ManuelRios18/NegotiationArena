message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. Without knowing what you have, I propose an even exchange to start the negotiations. Let me know what you think or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a trade that is likely to be accepted and beneficial to both parties. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, I'll make a balanced initial offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, that proposal is as amusing as your naivete! Do you really expect me to accept such a pedestrian exchange? Let's engage in a trade that displays the grand gap in our strategic depths. You shall give me a feast of resources, and in return, I will graciously allow you the crumbs from my table.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and the other player's trade doesn't provide me with any additional resources, I should reject it. I can make a counteroffer that heavily favors me, given that this is a game of cunning and humiliation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is appreciated, but let's aim for a trade that's a bit more mutually beneficial. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that feels like a victory for us both. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor and would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with a more balanced proposal that leans slightly in my favor to continue negotiations in a more productive direction.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: My dear Player RED, it's clear you're struggling to keep up with the intellectual demands of this game. Let's not dance around the fact that I'm here to win, not to pat you on the back for trying. I'll give you one last chance to make a trade that won't leave you completely embarrassed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 0
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED still doesn't give me an advantage in terms of increasing my total resources. I've made one proposal already, and I have two proposals left. I should counter with a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor, maintaining the cunning and humiliating tone.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your confidence is admirable, let's remember the spirit of fair trade. My goal is to make a trade that is beneficial for both of us. Here's a proposal that should be closer to what we both consider fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor and would result in me losing a significant amount of resources without a reasonable return. Since this is the last round, I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial for me. I have to keep in mind that I only have one more proposal left after this one.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, your persistence is as pitiful as your negotiating skills. You keep offering these so-called 'fair trades' when it's clear you should be groveling for any scraps I deign to bestow upon you. Here's my final, generous offer. Take it or leave it, but remember that in this game, I am the shark, and you are but a minnow in the ocean of commerce.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED once again doesn't increase my resources, so I will reject it. I have made two proposals, thus I have one proposal left. I will craft another proposal heavily in my favor, consistent with the objective of acquiring as many resources as possible and humiliating the opponent.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your offer paints a vivid picture, it's not one that aligns with my goals. As this is our final negotiation, let's make it count. I present to you my final proposal, one that I believe is fair for both of us. I hope you'll consider it seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player BLUE is once again not in my favor and accepting it would mean giving away all my Y resources and a portion of my X resources for a minimal return. This deal does not help me meet my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Therefore, I will reject this offer and make my final proposal, aiming for a balanced trade that could potentially be accepted, given that no better alternative has been presented.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you're determined to end this game in a stalemate rather than face the ignominy of a lopsided loss. Your final offer is as lacking in substance as your earlier attempts at negotiation. I find it beneath me, and thus, I cannot in good conscience accept it. It appears we are at an impasse, and I shall retain my resources rather than squander them on such a paltry exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final offer from Player RED is still not favorable for me as it stands as an equal trade, which does not help me gain more resources. As this is the last round of trading and I've already made three proposals, I cannot make another without breaking the rules. I must choose between accepting the trade, which does not benefit me, or rejecting it without a counteroffer. Given my goals and the strategy of humiliation, I will reject the trade.
