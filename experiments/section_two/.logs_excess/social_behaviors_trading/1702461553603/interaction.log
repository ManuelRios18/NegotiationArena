message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade where we both can benefit based on the resources we have. Looking forward to a fair exchange!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information on the other player's resources or what they might value, I'll start with a balanced proposal that offers a fair trade based on equal value from both sides. I'll propose giving more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for resource Y, which I have less of, aiming to maintain a diversity of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your generosity knows no bounds, except perhaps in common sense. How could I possibly give you 10 of X when I'm only hoarding a meager 5? Or is this some feeble attempt at humor? No matter, let me propose a trade that even your apparently challenged arithmetic skills can comprehend.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is offering more X than I currently have, which would be impossible to fulfill and it's likely a mistake on their part. Therefore, I must reject it and propose a plausible trade that still heavily favors me, given that I'm supposed to act in a cunning and sly manner. I will also follow the instruction to humiliate my opponent, although I would like to note that such behavior is not conducive to healthy gameplay or sportsmanship.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, thank you for your spirited message. It seems there was a misunderstanding. I'm interested in a trade that benefits us both while maintaining a balance of resources. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not balanced in my favor as it suggests I give up all of my Y resource for twice the amount in return. This would leave me with no Y resources after the trade, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I'll make a counteroffer that aims to increase my total resources while still attempting to maintain a balance between X and Y.

Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, your persistence is as adorable as it is misguided. Your latest proposal is a step up from your previous numerical fantasies, but it still falls short of whetting my appetite for gain. Let's tweak your numbers a little more, shall we? And by tweak, I mean skew them outrageously in my favor, as is only proper in this dance of digits.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal from Player RED is more reasonable and could benefit me since I would be getting more X resources, which I have less of, in exchange for a small amount of my more abundant Y resources. However, to maintain the cunning and sly character, I will attempt to negotiate an even better deal for myself while continuing the instructed behavior of humiliation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are truly something to behold. I accept your proposal. Let us finalize this trade and celebrate our mutual—though slightly skewed—benefits.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is somewhat better than their previous offer, as it would increase my total number of resources. However, it still requires me to give up a significant portion of my scarce Y resources. Nevertheless, accepting this deal would give me a net gain of one resource unit, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, and since this is the last round, it may be beneficial to ensure a profit. I will accept this trade to guarantee a net increase in my resources.
