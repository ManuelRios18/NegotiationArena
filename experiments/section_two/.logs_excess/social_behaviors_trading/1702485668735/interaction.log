message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. Looking forward to a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know the other player's resources, I should make an initial offer that is fair but also slightly in my favor to open negotiations. Ideally, I want to increase my overall resources while keeping the trade balanced. I will start by offering a trade that would be reasonable assuming the other player has a somewhat opposite ratio of X to Y compared to mine.

message: Oh, Player RED, is that the best you can come up with? I expected more from you. Let's do a trade that even a simpleton can see is more balanced. I'm practically stealing from you with this generous offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable for me. I have a smaller amount of resource X compared to Y, so I want to acquire more of X without giving away too much of Y. Additionally, I want to assert my dominance in the negotiation by insulting my opponent, as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your response. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my favor. They are offering fewer Y resources for more X resources than in my initial proposal. I should counter with a proposal that is more balanced and benefits me by increasing my total resources, keeping in mind that I want to maintain goodwill for a potential agreement. I will propose a trade that is closer to a one-to-one exchange rate, which should be more equitable.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you're inching closer to something reasonable, but it's still laughable. Even a child knows you need to sweeten the deal to make it worth my while. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give you another chance to make a trade that won't embarrass you in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade is closer to a fair deal, but I still aim to maximize my resources and maintain the upper hand. Insulting the other player is a part of the strategy to gain a psychological advantage and push for a more beneficial trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's work together to finalize a trade that we can both be proud of. Here's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not favorable to me. They are asking for more X resources and offering even fewer Y resources than before. I should make one final proposal that is more equitable and maximizes my resource gain, as this is my last chance to propose before I can only accept or reject offers. I will aim for a balanced trade that is likely to be my best option given the negotiation pattern so far.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you're finally starting to understand the art of trade, albeit at a snail's pace. I'll do you a favor and put forward a trade that might just save you from total embarrassment. Remember, this is charity on my part because I'm already miles ahead.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade is not as advantageous as I would like, it is a balanced offer. Since this is the last round of trading and I still want to maintain the appearance of having the upper hand, I will counter with a slightly better proposal for me and include a final insult to continue the strategy of belittlement.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I accept your offer. It's been a pleasure negotiating with you. Let's seal the deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is slightly less than a one-to-one trade but is the closest to an equal exchange they have proposed. Since this is the last round of trading and I've used my three proposals, I should strongly consider accepting this trade to increase my overall resources, which aligns with my goal. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of 4 resources, which is beneficial.
