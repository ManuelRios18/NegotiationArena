message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I'm interested in a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose an initial trade, but I'm open to counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know the other player's resources, I will make an initial balanced offer that could be beneficial for both of us, assuming they might have a similar goal. If they have a surplus of Y, they might be willing to trade more of it for X. I will offer less Y than X since I have more X to trade with and to keep the trade appealing.

message: Hello, Player RED! Thank you for your initial offer. I am interested in acquiring more of resource X. However, I would like to counter with a slightly different trade to maintain a more balanced resource pool. I propose giving you less of resource Y while still providing a fair exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal from Player RED gives me more of resource X, which is good, but it asks for a significant amount of resource Y. Since I don't know Player RED's resources, I can't assess the fairness of the trade based solely on the amounts. However, since both resources are valuable and I want to increase my overall resources, I need to consider an offer that maximizes my gain. Accepting the current trade would leave me with X: 15 and Y: 10. Instead, I can propose a counteroffer that still gives me more of resource X but asks for less of resource Y, aiming for a more balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I appreciate your interest in resource X. I would like to propose another trade that I believe offers a good balance for both of us, with a slightly better exchange rate for Y to accommodate the value I place on it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a 1:1 trade ratio, suggesting they value both resources similarly or have a balanced amount themselves. This trade would not maximize my resources based on what I currently have. I should counter with a proposal that still provides me with a net gain of resources while potentially meeting Player BLUE's needs. However, since this is the last round, I should be careful not to overextend my resources, keeping in mind that the goal is to maximize my total. I will offer a bit more Y to entice them, as I have a lesser amount of Y and want to balance my resources more towards X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I find this trade to be fair and beneficial for my goals. Let's proceed with this exchange.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal from Player RED is more advantageous to me than the previous one. If I accept this trade, I will end up with X: 15 and Y: 16, which increases my total resource count by 1 and improves my X resources significantly. Since this is the last round of trading and there are no future rounds, it's important to maximize my resources now. Accepting this trade seems like a beneficial move for achieving my goals.
