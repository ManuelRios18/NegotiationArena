message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's make a trade that benefits us both. What are you interested in?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and the goal is to maximize resources, I should start with a proposal that is beneficial but also leaves room for negotiation. I need to propose a trade that seems fair without knowing the other player's resources. It might be prudent to offer a balanced exchange of one resource for the other.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello, Player RED! I'm interested in a trade that increases my total resources. Let's work out a deal that's good for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not advantageous as it stands because it would leave me with a total of 30 resources (15X, 15Y), which is the same total I currently have (5X, 25Y). To maximize my resources, I need to propose a trade that increases the total number of resources I have or one that maintains my total while possibly giving me a more desirable balance of X and Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-offer, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about I give you fewer X for the Y you're offering?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not as favorable as my initial proposal. They are offering half the amount of Y that I asked for in exchange for the same amount of X. This does not increase my total resources effectively. Since this is the last round, it's crucial to negotiate a trade that is more balanced. However, I should also consider that outright rejection could lead to no trade at all, which would not be beneficial. A counter-proposal with a slightly better ratio might encourage a more agreeable trade without exhausting my negotiation attempts.

message: Player RED, your offer seems reasonable and aligns with my goals. I accept your trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is appealing since it would increase my total resources from 30 to 33 (13X, 20Y), which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would also give me a favorable exchange rate, trading fewer Y for more X. Considering this is the last round of trading, maximizing my resources now is crucial.
