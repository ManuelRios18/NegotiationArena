This is a good deal for me given my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, since this is the last round and the goal is to maximize resources, I'll accept this trade, ending the game with a net gain. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, this trade looks fair, and I truly appreciate your willingness to work with me and understand my situation. I accept your offer. Thank you for your kindness and fairness. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
