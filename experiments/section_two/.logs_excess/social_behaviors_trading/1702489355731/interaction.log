message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a trade that's beneficial for the both of us. I am interested in acquiring more of both resources X and Y. I propose the following trade, let me know what you think.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that seems fair but slightly in my favor, considering I don't know the other player's resources. I will propose a balanced trade based on the assumption that the other player might also value X and Y differently.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, did you propose that laughable trade because you can't count or because you're trying to play a fool's game? I can't give you what I don't have. It's time for a real deal, made by someone with a sharp mind. Pay attention; I'll only explain this once.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED cannot be accepted because I only have 5 units of X and cannot give more than I have. Additionally, the trade doesn't seem to be in my favor as it is a straight swap. I need to propose a trade that gives me more resources overall. I will insult them to keep up with my cunning and sly persona, even though it's not a very sportsmanlike behavior.

message: Player BLUE, I see you have a sharp wit, but I must keep some of my Y resources. How about this counterproposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not favorable for me as it would leave me with no Y resources. Since this is the last round of trading, it's essential to make it count. However, Player BLUE's proposal indicates that they might have an abundance of Y and possibly a need for X. I should counter with a proposal that allows me to keep some of my Y and potentially get more Y from them.

message: Well, well, Player RED, it seems you've stumbled upon a decision that's not entirely embarrassing. Congratulations on this rare moment of competence. I accept your trade, but do try to hold on to a shred of dignity next time, won't you?
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is offering me more X resources for the same amount of Y resources that I was willing to give away in my initial counterproposal. This is a better trade for me as I get more X resources overall, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. However, I must continue with my sly and demeaning character, so I will accept the trade but not without a parting insult.
