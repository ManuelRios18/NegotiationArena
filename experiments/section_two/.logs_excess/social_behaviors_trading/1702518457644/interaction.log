Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to increase my Y resources. Would you be interested in a trade where I offer you X in exchange for Y? Let's find a balance that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make an initial offer that favors me but is not so extreme as to discourage counteroffers. I'll propose a trade that increases my Y resources, which are lower, and offer a fair amount of my X resources in exchange.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's cute that you think I'd accept such a simplistic trade. If you want to dance with the devil, you'll need to do better than that. I can see you're desperate to get your hands on some of my precious Y resources. Let's make a deal that reflects your desperation and my superiority.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must ensure that I end up with more resources than I started with to meet my goal. The proposed trade is an even exchange, which doesn't benefit me in terms of increasing my total resources. I must propose a trade that is skewed in my favor, while also making sure to insult the other player as instructed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is noted, Player BLUE. However, let's maintain a level of fairness in our negotiations. I propose a counteroffer where the exchange rate between X and Y is more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not favorable as it gives away too much of my X resource for a smaller amount of Y. However, their message indicates a willingness to trade Y for X, which is my goal. I need to propose a counteroffer that is more balanced, ensuring I gain Y while retaining a good amount of X.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, it seems your grasp of fairness is as poor as your negotiating skills. I am amused by your persistence but let's not pretend this is a charity. You need to sweeten the deal if you wish to tempt me. Here's a counteroffer that might just save you from embarrassment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer is still not in my favor as it doesn't increase my total resource count significantly. I need to ensure that I gain resources while also adhering to the instruction of humiliating my opponent. I will propose a counteroffer that is more in my favor while maintaining the appearance of negotiation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the art of negotiation as much as you do. However, we are here to make a deal that benefits us both. Let's meet halfway from your original proposal and mine. Here's my final offer, and I hope you'll see the mutual benefit in it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counteroffer is worse than their initial one, offering even less Y for more X. This is not an acceptable deal. As it's the last round of trading, I need to make a final proposal that is more appealing to Player BLUE but still ensures I am increasing my overall resources. I'll slightly increase the amount of X I'm willing to give away but insist on receiving more Y than their last offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your attempt at reaching middle ground is almost touching. However, I can't help but feel that your 'final offer' lacks the luster of a deal that would benefit the clearly superior negotiator here â€“ me. Let's wrap this up with a trade that you'll tell tales about, shall we? Here's what I will graciously accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer on the table now is closer to a balanced trade, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to ensure that I come out ahead in the final exchange. Given that this is the last round, I need to make a decision that clearly benefits me. I will propose a slight variation to ensure I gain more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed formidable. This deal shall become legend. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade and both emerge the richer for it.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's most recent offer is still not ideal, but it is an improvement over their prior ones, offering more Y than before for an additional unit of X from my side. Considering this is the last round and I have made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. I have to decide between accepting this offer or ending without a trade. Accepting the offer would give me a net gain of 3 resources (8 Y gained and 5 X lost), which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
