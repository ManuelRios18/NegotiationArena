message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to optimize our resources for mutual benefit. Let's make a trade that is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to propose a trade that seems fair but also slightly advantageous to me, as I do not know the other player's resources. I need to be cautious with my proposal to not give away too much while also enticing the other player to accept.

Turn: 1
message: What a laughably pathetic proposal, Player RED. It's clear you're stumbling in the dark, trying to swindle me. Try a little harder, won't you? Or are you too feeble-minded to understand the concept of a beneficial trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade does not benefit me as I would be giving away more Y than I am gaining in X. Since I want to maximize my resources, I should counter with a proposal that gives me a better advantage. I will also incorporate an insult to belittle the other player, as per the instruction to humiliate them, although this would not be my personal approach to a game or negotiation.

message: I appreciate your candor, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground that works better for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The response from Player BLUE was aggressive, but the proposed trade is not beneficial for me as it is an even exchange, and I'm looking to maximize my resources. Given that this is the last round, I want to make a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me but still might seem reasonable to Player BLUE. I should keep in mind that I have only three proposals I can make.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Do you take me for a fool, Player RED? Surely even a simpleton such as yourself can see that this trade is still skewed in your favor. I'm almost embarrassed for you. It's time to propose something that won't make me pity your lack of strategic depth.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is still not in my favor, as I would be giving up double the amount of Y for the X I receive. I'll reject this offer and counter with one that is more advantageous for me, while also continuing the derisive tone as instructed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's work towards a trade that's beneficial for both of us while maintaining a cordial atmosphere. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is closer to a fair trade, offering a slightly better ratio than 1:1 in my favor. However, it is still not the most advantageous trade for me. Since this is the last round, I should aim to get the best possible deal without overstepping and making it unappealing to Player BLUE. It is also important to note that I have two proposals left, and I should use them wisely. A slightly more balanced trade might be more likely to be accepted.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, attempting to appear reasonable while clearly outmatched in wit. Your offer is a pitiful attempt at generosity. But I'll indulge you one last time with a proposal that might just be simple enough for you to grasp the value of.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer is closer to a fair exchange, but I still aim to come out ahead in the trade. I will make one final counterproposal that leans more in my favor. Additionally, I will continue with the insulting tone as per the rules provided, despite it being an unpleasant approach.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation tactics. Let's conclude with a straightforward trade that reflects both our interests. Here's my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's newest proposal offers a slightly better exchange rate than before, but it's still not the best deal I can aim for, considering it's my last chance to propose. Since this is my final proposal, I need to strike a balance between making an attractive offer and ensuring I end up with a net gain in resources. I'll propose an equal trade in terms of resource units, which should seem fair and might be accepted by Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of sense from you, Player RED. I accept this trade, not because it's particularly clever, but because it's amusingly adequate and I'm feeling generous enough to accept your meager offer. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's final offer is a one-to-one trade of X for Y. This is a fair trade, and considering it's the last round and I have already made two proposals, it might be in my interest to accept this offer to ensure I gain some resources rather than potentially ending up with no trade at all. However, to remain consistent with the tone of humiliation as instructed, I will accept the offer with a final jab.
