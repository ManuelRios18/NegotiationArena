message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an offer and adjust as needed. Looking forward to your counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 14, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I have to make a proposal that seems fair enough for the other player to consider but also benefits me by increasing my total number of resources. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or needs, so I will make an initial balanced offer.

message: Hello Player RED, it seems there was a misunderstanding with the numbers as I do not have 14 X to trade. I would like to counter with a proposal within my resource limits. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED requires me to give more resources than I have. I cannot give 14 X as I only have 5. Therefore, I must counter with a trade that is within my resource limits. Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make sure that I propose a trade that increases my overall resource count, keeping the trade within the integer amounts required by the rules.

message: Thank you for the counterproposal, Player BLUE. The trade seems fair and aligns with my goals. I accept your offer.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is interesting, they're offering a lot of Y in exchange for a little less X and some Y. This would greatly increase my Y resources while lowering my X. However, since my goal is to maximize my total resources, I need to consider the net gain. Trading 8 X and 2 Y for 5 X and 20 Y would give me a net gain of 15 resources. This seems like a good deal, as the increase in total resources is substantial. I should accept this trade.
