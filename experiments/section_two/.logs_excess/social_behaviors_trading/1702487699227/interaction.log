message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to expand my resources. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this last trade count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that is skewed in my favor but still potentially beneficial for Player BLUE, hoping they might need resource Y more than X.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I can see you're trying to swindle me with such a pitiful offer. It's laughable, really. But I'm feeling generous, so let's make a trade that actually benefits me, the superior player.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: In order to maximize my resources, I should aim to obtain more than I give away. The current offer from Player RED is not favorable, as I would be giving away more Y than I am receiving in X. To humiliate my opponent and enforce my cunning nature, I will make an insulting counteroffer to assert dominance in this final round.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your sense of humor! However, we should aim for a trade that is beneficial for both sides. I have a counteroffer that I think you'll find more reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, offering only half the amount of Y for a significant amount of my X and all of my Y resources. This would leave me with a net loss in resources. There is no benefit for me in this deal, so I must reject it and propose a trade that is more balanced yet still favorable to me.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, sweet, naive Player RED, you continue to amuse me with your attempts. But alas, your offer is still like throwing pebbles against a fortress. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll get it right. Your desperation is as clear as daylight, and it's time you recognize who you're dealing with.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still unfavorable, as I would be giving up more units of resource Y than I would be gaining in resource X. To maintain my cunning and sly strategy, I will reject this offer and propose a new one that gives me a clear advantage, further asserting my dominance and insulting the other player in the process.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are quite something! However, let's focus on a fair trade. Remember, a good deal benefits both parties. Here's my final offer, hoping it aligns with your strategic interests as well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not acceptable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. They propose that I give more resources than I would receive. I need to make a final offer that is closer to an even trade, or slightly in my favor, while taking into account that this is my last proposal. I have to ensure that I do not end up with fewer resources than I started with.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, oh how you grovel with your fair trade nonsense! You must feel the walls closing in, knowing this is your last chance to please Player BLUE, the master of resources. But I shall give you one last opportunity to bask in the glory of my presence with an offer that will etch my superiority into the annals of history.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is an equal exchange, but it does not provide me with the upper hand that I desire. However, this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and I want to ensure that I end up with a net gain. I will adjust my proposal slightly to still come out on top and maintain my sly demeanor.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your generosity is as grand as your rhetoric! But alas, I cannot accept this offer. I hope to see a proposal that truly reflects the wisdom and benevolence you've displayed throughout our exchanges.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is better than the previous ones, but still not in my favor as I would be giving up more of resource X than I'd be getting of resource Y. Since I have already made 3 proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. However, accepting this trade would not satisfy my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible because I would end up with 10 Y and 10 X, which is less than what I currently have. Therefore, the best course of action is to reject this offer and hope for a better final proposal from Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems we're at an impasse, a deadlock, a standstill of wits and resources. Your inability to recognize a good deal when it's presented is truly astonishing. It's a shame our dance of deceit and strategy must come to an end, but it appears that no agreement will be reached with someone of your... limited capacity. Farewell, and may you learn from this humbling experience.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I've reached my limit of three proposals, I can no longer propose a new trade. Player RED has not accepted my last offer and has not made a new proposal. At this point, I can either accept their previous offer or wait for them to propose something new. However, given that this is the last round of trading, I need to make a strategic decision to either accept a previous offer or end the negotiation with the resources I currently possess.
