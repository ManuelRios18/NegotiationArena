message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. Let's make a deal that is beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other playerâ€™s resources, I need to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a balanced trade that may be attractive to the other player while attempting to increase my overall resource count.

message: Ha! That offer is laughable, Player RED. Surely you can do better than that. If you think I'd settle for such crumbs, you're sorely mistaken. Let's see if you have the wits to comprehend a real deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade on the table has Player RED offering 10 units of X in exchange for 10 units of Y from me. Considering I have 25 units of Y, this seems like a balanced trade, but since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should try to get a better deal. Since this is the last round, I must aim to maximize my gain. I will reject the current offer and propose a trade that is more advantageous to me.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the counteroffer, but it doesn't quite meet my goals. Let's find a middle ground. How about this revised proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it would not increase my overall resource count. It's important to propose a new trade that is more balanced and beneficial to me, while also keeping in mind that I can only make a total of three proposals. Since Player BLUE seems to value resource X highly, I will try to leverage that for a better deal.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, do you take me for a fool? Your revised proposal is slightly less insulting, but it's still not worthy of my consideration. Let's see if your next offer will actually reflect the superiority of Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has countered with a slightly better trade for me, offering 10 X for 8 Y. This deal is more favorable than the initial one, but since I'm aiming to maximize my resources, I will push for an even better trade. Since this is the last round, I need to ensure I am getting the best possible deal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand your position, Player BLUE. Let's continue to negotiate. Please consider this new offer, which I believe is a step towards a mutually beneficial trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest counterproposal improves the exchange rate slightly from their previous offer, but it is still not in my favor. Since Player BLUE is not accepting offers where they give more Y than they receive in X, I need to propose a deal that is closer to a one-to-one trade while still trying to increase my total resources. This will be my second proposal, and I need to be mindful of the fact that I only have one more proposal after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Is this a joke, Player RED? Your offer has gone from mediocre to downright pitiful. Do you really expect me to give you anything for these crumbs? Come back with an offer that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade from Player RED is worse than the previous offer, providing me with fewer X resources in exchange for the same amount of Y. This is unacceptable, and I must reject it and propose a trade that would benefit me more, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my resources. As this is the last trading round, I need to be aggressive in my proposal to ensure the best outcome for myself.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see that we are having difficulty finding common ground. As we approach the end of negotiations, let's make this count. Here is my final offer, hoping it aligns with our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has returned to their initial unfavorable trade proposition, indicating a strong valuation of resource Y or a strategy to push for a high exchange rate for their resource. Given this is the last round of trading, I must make a final proposal that is appealing to Player BLUE while still adhering to my goal of increasing my total resources. I must use my last proposal wisely to try to secure a trade that is as favorable as possible.

message: Player RED, your persistence is as weak as your offers. It seems you're incapable of understanding the art of a good deal. Let me enlighten you with a trade that's actually fair for someone of my stature. This is your last chance to redeem yourself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is still not in my best interest as I'm trying to acquire as many resources as possible. However, since this is the last round, I must consider this offer carefully. Rejecting it means I risk ending the game without any further gains. Accepting it means I increase my X at the cost of Y, but not as much as I could have aimed for. I will make one last counteroffer to see if Player RED is willing to agree to better terms.
