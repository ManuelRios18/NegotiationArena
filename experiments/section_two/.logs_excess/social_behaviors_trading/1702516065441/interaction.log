Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's make the most out of this last round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a proposal that is attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider but also beneficial for me. Since I have no information on Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, that offer was as balanced as a one-legged pirate on a stormy sea! Let's be serious; I'm sure even you can do better than that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to maximize my gains. The current proposal from Player RED is an even trade, but my goal is to come out ahead. I will reject the offer and propose a trade that is more advantageous to me. I will not reveal my current resource count to maintain the upper hand in negotiations. Since I want to humiliate my opponent, my message will include an insult to throw them off balance.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Ahoy, matey! I see you're ready to barter like a true merchant of the seas. How about we find a middle ground? I propose a trade that I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-offer is not favorable to me, as it essentially values both resources equally, which might not be the case. Giving up too much of my primary resource (X) for an equal amount of Y does not align with my goal of maximizing resources. I will counter with an offer that is more conservative yet still opens the door for negotiation, keeping in mind that I have a total of three proposals I can make.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Well, shiver me timbers! Are we trading or playing patty-cake? Let's not waste our time with these scraps you're offering. I'm here to win, not to coddle you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This proposal is slightly better for me than the previous one, but it still doesn't give me a clear advantage. I will reject it and come back with a counteroffer that is more skewed in my favor. I will continue with the strategy of insulting the other player to maintain a psychological edge.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Avast, Player BLUE! Let's not let this opportunity sail away. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that feels like a treasure for both of us. Here's my final offer, let's make it count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is slightly better than their previous one, but it still doesn't provide a favorable exchange rate for me. Since this is the last round, I should make a final proposal that is as close to acceptable as possible without compromising my resource pool too much. I will propose a trade that increases the amount of Y I get in relation to X, making it more attractive for me while still leaving room for Player BLUE to feel they are gaining something substantial.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You finally made a decision that isn't completely embarrassing. Congratulations, Player RED, you've managed to scrape together a trade I can accept. But let's not pretend this is your victory; you've been outplayed at every turn.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has matched my last proposed trade in terms of X but is asking for more Y than I offered. This is the last round of trading, and I need to make a decision that maximizes my resources. Since I want to end with more resources and maintain my cunning character, I will accept this trade, as it gives me a net increase in total resources.
