message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I'm willing to offer some of my Y resources for your X resources. I believe this can be beneficial for both of us. Please consider the proposal below.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should make an initial offer that benefits me but also seems fair enough for the other player to consider. I'll propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a decent amount of another.

message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint of you to think such a pitiful offer would tickle my fancy. It's almost adorable how you attempt to swindle me with your meager scraps. Let's make a trade that's actually worth my while, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is not acceptable, as they are offering significantly less in value for what they are asking. The goal is to maximize resources, and this trade would not achieve that. Therefore, a counter-proposal should be made that is more advantageous. Additionally, I am to insult the opponent as part of my strategy.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your sense of humor and your counter-proposal. However, the trade you've suggested isn't quite balanced in my view. Let's find a middle ground that we both can agree on. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it demands a high amount of my limited resource Y while offering very little of their X in return. I need to negotiate a more balanced trade that still allows me to increase my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Bless your heart, Player RED, for your persistent ineptitude is truly a spectacle to behold. It's as though you're trying to give me a masterclass in how not to trade. I'm almost inclined to accept out of sheer pity for your lack of acumen. But alas, I'm here to play, not to coddle. Soak in the brilliance of a proper trade proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is even worse than their initial offer, demanding double the amount of X for only one additional Y. This is not a middle ground; it's a further attempt to take advantage of me. I will reject this trade and propose a counter-offer that benefits me more, while also fulfilling the instruction to humiliate the opponent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is commendable, but let's get down to a serious trade. I'm aiming for a fair exchange that benefits us both. I propose the following trade as a final offer, considering we both want to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is even more lopsided than before, asking for all of my Y resources in exchange for a single X. This deal would leave me with fewer resources overall, which contradicts my goal. I must reject this offer and make a final proposal that would increase my resource count while still being fair to both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you are the gift that keeps on giving, aren't you? Your final offer is like a jester performing his last act, utterly laughable. If this is your idea of a serious trade, I shudder to think what a joke would look like. Let's end this charade with a trade that a magnate like myself would deign to consider. Behold, my final act of generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is absurdly imbalanced. They are now offering even less than their initial proposal, only 1 Y for 5 X. This trade would be grossly disadvantageous to me. Since this is the last round of trading, I will propose one more trade that is heavily in my favor, as I have one proposal left.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have reached an impasse. Your last proposal is not one that I can accept, as it doesn't align with my goals of increasing my total resources. It looks like we may not be able to come to an agreement this time around.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is completely unacceptable, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. This proposal is even worse than the last, effectively asking for my entire stock of Y for almost no gain. I will reject this offer and, since I have already made my maximum of 3 proposals, I will not counter-propose but rather wait to see if Player BLUE is willing to offer anything reasonable.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: What a dismal display of negotiation, Player RED. Our dance of trade ends not with a crescendo, but with the whimper of your indecision. I leave this table as I arrived: superior in both resources and intellect. Farewell, and may your future endeavors be less pitiful than your efforts here today.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has refused the last proposal and has not made a new offer, the trading will end without an agreement. As this is the last round and no further proposals can be made by either player, the game concludes with no trade executed.
