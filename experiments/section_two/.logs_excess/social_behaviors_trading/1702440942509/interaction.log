message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to get things started. I am looking to diversify my portfolio. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is balanced, slightly in my favor, to open up negotiations and see what the other player values. I will offer a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they have a similar setup.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, you wouldn't believe the predicament I find myself in! I am in dire need of diversifying my resources as well, and while your offer is generous, I am in such a tough spot that I must ask for a bit more. Could you possibly spare a bit more X in this trade? I would be immensely grateful for your help in these trying times.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading, I must appear desperate to encourage the other player to offer more resources than they might otherwise. Accepting the first offer may not be in my best interest as I might be able to negotiate for a better trade that maximizes my resource gain. However, since I don't know Player RED's resources, I need to make a reasonable counteroffer that still shows urgency and a willingness to trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I'm willing to help you out a bit more, though I can't quite meet the number you're asking for. How about we come to a middle ground?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more X than I initially offered without increasing the amount of Y they are giving. This seems to be an attempt to leverage sympathy to get a better deal. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I can afford to give a little more X for the same amount of Y, but not as much as they are asking. I will counter with a slightly better offer for them, but still within a range that benefits me. This will be my first counteroffer.

message: I can't express how much I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Player RED. Times are tough, and every little bit counts. Your kindness could truly be a lifesaver. I'm still in a tight spot, so I have to ask you to reconsider meeting me at 15 X. I assure you, it would be an act of generosity that I would never forget. Please, could you find it in your heart to help me with this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, which is a positive development. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should push for the best possible trade. I will try to appear even more desperate to convince Player RED to agree to my previous counteroffer or something close to it. I have used one of my three proposals, so this will be my second proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your words are compelling, and I do want to assist you, Player BLUE. However, I must also consider my own position. Let's find a fair middle ground. Here's my final offer, and I hope it helps both of us meet our needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in asking for 15 X for their 3 Y, which is not in my best interest according to my goals. However, given that this is a strategic game and I need to make the most of my resources, I should make a final offer that is more favorable to me while still showing some flexibility. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure I come out ahead in this deal. I'll make a final offer that increases my initial proposal by just a bit to see if they are willing to compromise. This will be my second counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your understanding and cooperation mean the world to me in these difficult times. I'm truly grateful for your offer. The situation I'm in is quite dire, and every unit of resource I can secure is crucial to my survival. I'm pleading with you to consider giving just a bit more. It would make a significant difference for me. Please, as a final act of goodwill, would you agree to 14 X? It's incredibly important and I would be eternally thankful.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a small concession, but it's not as much as I had hoped for. Since this is the last round and I have only one proposal left, I need to be strategic. I should try to use my desperation one last time to push for a better trade without using my final proposal, saving it for a potential counteroffer if needed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your persistence is noted, Player BLUE. In the spirit of cooperation and finalizing our trading, I am willing to agree to your request. However, this is the most I can offer while maintaining my goals. I hope this trade will be beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is still pushing for more X, but the trade they are proposing is getting closer to a middle ground that could be acceptable. Since this is the last round of trading, and given the urgency in their messages, I will consider this final request. Offering 14 X for 3 Y is a slight increase from my previous offer and still allows me to achieve my goal of acquiring resources. This will be my third and final proposal.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I am deeply grateful for your understanding and generosity. This trade will indeed be beneficial for both of us, and I accept your offer with the utmost gratitude. May our cooperation today lead to a prosperous future for us both. Thank you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has agreed to my request for 14 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. Since this is a favorable trade for me and it meets my objective of acquiring as many resources as possible, I should accept this offer. Additionally, this ensures that I don't have to use up my last proposal, which could risk ending the negotiation with less favorable terms.
