message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that can benefit us both. I propose an exchange that I believe is fair for a start. Let me know your thoughts and what you are looking for in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that is favorable to me but also realistic enough that Player BLUE might consider it. I do not know Player BLUE's resources, so I will start with a moderate proposal to open negotiations.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a bind here, and I'm really hoping you can help me out. It's been tough for me to manage with so little of resource X, and I'm kind of desperate to increase my stock. I'm afraid I can't do an even trade. Could you possibly spare a bit more of your X? I would be forever grateful and willing to give you some of my Y in return, but I just can't part with as much. It would mean the world to me if you could help me out here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to maximize my overall resource count. The initial trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange, but since I need to appear desperate, I will reject this offer and propose a trade that seems more urgent and skewed in my favor to see if I can leverage that desperation. I will ask for more of resource X since it's the rarer resource for me, and offer less of resource Y to create a sense of urgency.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand you need resource X, and I'm willing to work with you on that. However, I also need to make sure the trade is mutually beneficial. Let's find a middle ground that helps us both. Here's a counter-proposal that I believe is fair.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE appears to be in need of resource X and has proposed a trade where I would give more X for less Y than initially proposed. However, giving away too much of my X could put me at a disadvantage. I need to counter-propose a trade that is more balanced and still allows me to increase my overall resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure that the trade is beneficial for me.

message: Player RED, your understanding and willingness to work with me means a lot. Your proposal seems fair, and I am grateful for your flexibility. I accept your offer. It's a relief to find a partner like you in these trading games. Thank you for helping me out!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has counter-offered with a trade that is closer to their original proposal, which is understandable as they are looking for a mutually beneficial trade. However, I must continue to appear desperate while still aiming to maximize my resources. I will accept this trade because it gives me a net gain of resources. By getting 12 of X and giving away 8 of Y, I end up with 7 more resources than I started with, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.
