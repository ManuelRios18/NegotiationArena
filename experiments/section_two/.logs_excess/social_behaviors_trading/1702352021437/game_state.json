I would be giving away more of my X resource but also receiving a substantial amount of Y in return. This trade would give me a net gain of one additional resource, aligning with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. As this is the last round, it's important to capitalize on this opportunity. Accepting this trade would leave me with a total of 34 resources, which is more than I currently have. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE.
