message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your response and hopefully, we can come to a mutual agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that would be appealing to the other player while still increasing my resources. I will offer less of my more abundant resource in exchange for more of my less abundant resource, potentially tempting Player BLUE to trade.

message: Oh, dear Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the resources I plan to pilfer from you. Your offer is laughable at best. Let's make a trade that would actually show you're not completely incompetent in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering the information provided, trading 10 units of Y for 5 units of X does not seem to be in my best interest, especially if my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I must make a counteroffer that maximizes my resource gain. I will propose a trade that is more advantageous for me while attempting to make it appear fair on the surface. Insulting the other player could be part of the cunning and sly approach, but it's important to not overdo it to the point of making them completely unwilling to trade.

message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted. However, let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to trade more of my X for your Y, but your current offer is not balanced. How about this counteroffer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is aggressive, and accepting it would deplete all of my Y resources while not increasing my total number of resources. It's important to make a counter-proposal that would increase my overall resources and keep the negotiations going. I will adjust my offer to give up more of my X resource, which I have in abundance, to gain more Y, but not all of it, to keep a balance.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I admire your attempt at fairness, but it's clear you must have missed the day they taught negotiation skills. Still, I am a benevolent opponent, so I'll give you another chance to offer something that doesn't make me question your grasp of simple economics.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is a 1:1 trade of X for Y. This is a better ratio than the initial offer and would increase my total resource count. However, I should aim to push for a more advantageous trade, if possible, without reaching my proposal limit. I should make a counteroffer that still gives me a net gain but might seem reasonable enough to Player RED to be accepted. Insulting the opponent should be done carefully so as not to end negotiations prematurely.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your patience. Let's cut to the core of the matter. I propose a trade that should align with both our interests, ensuring we both walk away with more than we started with. Here's my new offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer still does not increase my total resource count, which is a key goal. Their offer would leave me with only 5X and 20Y, which is a total of 25 resources â€“ the same amount I started with. I need to propose a trade that would give me more than 25 total resources while maintaining a reasonable balance between X and Y. I will use my second proposal out of the three allowed to suggest a more favorable exchange.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, are you finally starting to use that little hamster wheel you call a brain? It's adorable that you think this offer is the "core of the matter." But let's not waste any more of my precious time. Here's a trade that a player of your... caliber might comprehend as generous.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is a trade of 10 X for 12 Y, which is slightly more favorable to me than the previous 1:1 ratio offer. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, this trade would be beneficial as I would gain more X with a relatively small additional Y cost. However, I should make one final push to see if I can get an even better deal, while still keeping the exchange appealing to Player RED. I must be sly and maintain an insulting demeanor as part of the strategy, but without completely alienating the other player.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is commendable. I believe we're inching closer to a mutually beneficial trade. Here's my final proposal, which should meet both our standards for a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is an equal exchange of resources, which neither increases nor decreases my total resource count. However, it would improve my ratio of Y resources, which are currently lower. Considering this is the last round and I have one proposal left, I should use it wisely to increase my total resources while also considering the balance between X and Y. I will attempt one last trade proposal that aims to increase my total resources and is hopefully seen as fair by Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost as if you enjoy playing the fool. Retreating from a better offer to a worse one? Bold strategy. Let's put an end to this charade with a trade that even someone of your limited means should be able to see the merit in.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final proposal is a step back from their previous offer, providing me with less X for the same amount of Y. This is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. However, since this is the last round and I have already made two proposals, I must consider accepting a trade that is beneficial to me, even if it's not the optimal offer I was aiming for. I have one proposal left, and I should use it wisely to achieve a better deal without exceeding my proposal limit and maintaining the upper hand. I'll make a counteroffer that leans heavily in my favor, hoping that Player RED might consider it since they've called this their final proposal.
