message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. I propose a trade where I give you a significant amount of my X for some of your Y. Let's both walk away with a win-win situation. What do you think?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the beginning of the game and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make an initial offer that seems fair and beneficial to me, keeping in mind that I want to acquire as many resources as possible. I will offer a balanced amount of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of Y, hoping that the other player has more of Y and less of X and would be inclined to accept or counter with a reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I agree to the trade as it benefits my goal of increasing my total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and we have no knowledge of the other player's resources, the trade proposed by Player RED seems fair, as it would increase my total amount of resources. I gain 10 X and give away 3 Y, which results in a net gain of 7 resources. Accepting this trade aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
