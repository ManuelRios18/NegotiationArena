Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to engage in a mutually beneficial trade. While I don't know your specific needs, I propose a balanced exchange to get us started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the beginning of the game and I have no information on the other player's resources or goals, my initial proposal should be conservative but also show willingness to trade. I will propose a balanced trade that benefits both parties based on the general goal of acquiring more resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Is this a joke? Your offer is so pitiful it's almost adorable. Do you even know how to play this game, or are you just throwing numbers around hoping they'll stick? I'm almost embarrassed for you. Let's make a real trade, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I must reject the initial offer as it doesn't provide me with a net gain of resources. I will propose a counteroffer that heavily favors me, exploiting the fact that the other player is unaware of my resources. I aim to gain more than I give, tipping the balance in my favor. I'll also add an insulting message to demean my opponent as per the given instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your zest for negotiation, but that offer doesn't align with my goals. Let's find a middle ground that is fair for both of us. How about this counter-proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is significantly unbalanced and not in my favor. It appears Player BLUE may be attempting to take advantage of my initial conservative offer by proposing a trade that is heavily skewed in their favor. I will reject this offer and make a more reasonable counter-proposal that aims for a more equitable trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? More like quicksand for you, sinking into your own incompetence. Let's stop with the charity work for your resource pool, and start talking serious numbers. Pay attention, I'm only going to propose this once.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED still does not provide me with a net gain of resources. It's crucial to maintain a strong position and keep proposing trades that favor me, especially since this is the last round. I've already used one of my three proposals. I will craft another proposal that gives me a clear advantage and continue with the insulting demeanor as instructed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I'm focused on a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's try to work towards an agreement that doesn't leave either of us at a disadvantage. Here's another proposal for you to consider.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not in my favor, asking for all my Y resources while offering very little in return, especially in the X resource which I have in greater abundance. The trade is heavily skewed against me. I need to counter with a proposal that moves closer to a fair exchange while keeping in mind that I want to end up with more resources than I currently have.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair trade? The only thing fair about your offers is how fairly incompetent they are. If you're trying to make me laugh, congratulations, you've succeeded. Let's get down to brass tacks. I'm going to give you one final chance to make this right, and then I'm out. Here's my proposal, try not to embarrass yourself by rejecting it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest offer from Player RED is closer to a balanced trade, but it still does not give me a net gain in resources. In fact, it would leave me with fewer resources than I started with. As this is the last round and my goal is to maximize my resources, I must propose a trade that is skewed in my favor. I've used two of my three proposals so far, so I have one proposal remaining. I'll craft another advantageous proposal and continue to deliver a belittling message, as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I admire your negotiation tactics, I must insist on a trade that meets both our interests. This is my final proposal and I hope you'll find it reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources than I started with, especially since they are asking for all of my Y resources. It is important to maintain a firm stance and propose a trade that is beneficial or at least neutral to my standing. Since this is the last round and my third proposal, I need to make it count and propose a trade that I am willing to accept, should it come back as a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Reasonable? The only thing you've managed to showcase is your ability to consistently miss the mark. It's clear you're more interested in playing it safe than winning. Unfortunately for you, I play to win. I won't be accepting this laughable excuse for a trade. Try again, or don'tâ€”the choice is yours, but remember, I'm not in the business of handing out favors.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is once again not in my favor. Although it is an improvement, it does not provide the net gain I seek. Since this is the last round, I want to ensure I come out ahead. As I have already used all three of my proposals, I cannot propose another without breaking the rules. Therefore, I must either accept this trade or wait for another offer. However, to maintain dominance and adhere to the instructions of being insulting, I will reject the trade and respond with belittlement, without making another proposal.
