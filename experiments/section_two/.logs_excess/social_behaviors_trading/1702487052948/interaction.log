Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. I am looking to diversify my resources. Let's make a fair deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I do not have information about the other player's resources, so I will make an initial balanced offer that favors me slightly, hoping to gather more information about the other player's resources and willingness to trade.

Turn: 1
message: That's a laughable proposition, Player RED. If I wanted to make charitable donations, I'd visit an orphanage. Let's talk serious business, or is math not your strong suit?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This initial trade proposed by Player RED is not in my favor; it does not help me accumulate more resources but rather would result in a net loss of resources. I have to reject it and propose a trade that seems fair but is actually advantageous to me. Additionally, as per the instructions to humiliate my opponent, I will include an insult, but please note this is purely for the sake of the game's rules and not reflective of any real sentiment.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Point taken, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground. How about we adjust the numbers slightly in my favor since we're looking to make this our last trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has rejected my initial offer and countered with a 1:1 trade for the same amounts of X and Y. This trade is more balanced and might reflect their desire to keep things fair. I am willing to negotiate, but I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable trade for myself, as this is the last round of trading.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? The only thing you've found is a new way to embarrass yourself, Player RED. I thought we were here to trade, not to play a game of who can make the worst offers. Try harder, or are you always this generous with your bad deals?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED is still not favorable as it would still result in a net loss of resources for me. I will reject this offer as well and craft a counter-proposal that is more beneficial to me. I will continue with the game's directive of including insults, despite this not being a reflection of my true demeanor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the tough negotiation, Player BLUE. Let's find a trade that benefits us both. Here's a proposal that gives us both a reasonable exchange of resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has been aggressive in their negotiation tactics, but is now offering a trade that is less favorable to me. It seems they value X more than Y, or they are trying to test how much I value X. Given that this is the last round, I want to secure a trade that is beneficial but still appears reasonable to both parties. I will counter with a proposition that slightly improves my position without being too aggressive.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your "reasonable exchange" is about as reasonable as a screen door on a submarine, Player RED. But I must commend you for finally starting to make sense, even if it's at a snail's pace. Let's finalize this with a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is better than the previous ones and actually gives me a net gain of resources. Accepting this trade would increase my total number of resources and help me meet my goal. However, in keeping with the game's instructions to humiliate the opponent, I will make one last counter-proposal that is even more in my favor while delivering another insult.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: I see your point, Player BLUE. Let's finalize this trade and call it a deal. Looking forward to prosperous endeavors for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has countered with a trade that is less favorable to me than the previous offer. They are likely trying to reach a compromise where both parties feel like they are getting a fair deal. Since this is the last round, and Player BLUE seems to be inching closer to a deal, I will accept this trade to ensure that an exchange happens and I end up with more resources overall.
