message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a balanced trade that could benefit us both. I propose the following trade. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I don't know the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced offer that might be appealing. I'll offer less of the resource I have more of and ask for more of the resource I have less of, hoping to appeal to a potential surplus they might have.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be joking! That has to be the most laughable offer I've heard all day. Do you really think I'd fall for such an obvious attempt to shortchange me? I demand a trade that actually reflects my superior negotiating skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer does not seem balanced as I would be giving away a significant amount of my more abundant resource, Y, for a less significant amount of X. I want to counter with a trade that gives me a larger advantage. This is also an opportunity to assert dominance and belittle my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your spirited response, Player BLUE. Let's find common ground. I've revised my offer to present a more balanced trade that might be more to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with no Y resources at all and only a gain of 5 Y. This would not be a balanced trade in my favor. To move the negotiation forward, I'll propose a new trade that offers a bit more from my side but still keeps my Y resource intact, and I'll ask for less Y from them, to make it more reasonable.

Turn: 1
message: Common ground? You must be standing on quicksand, Player RED, because your idea of balance is as stable as a house of cards in a hurricane. You'll have to do better than that if you want to impress me. Here's a counter that reflects the true disparity between our strategic acumen.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is more favorable than the initial one, as I would be giving away fewer Y resources in exchange for a greater amount of X. However, there may still be room to push for an even better deal, especially since this is the last round and I can afford to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation style is certainly unique, Player BLUE. Let's try to finalize this with an offer that considers both our stances. I hope this trade appears more equitable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer doesn't work in my favor, as I would be giving up a significant amount of X for a minimal gain in Y. Their proposal suggests that they value Y much higher than X, or they are trying to gauge my desperation. I will make a final offer that is closer to an even exchange based on my initial resource amounts, while still keeping an advantageous position for myself.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Unique? I prefer the term 'unparalleled,' Player RED. It seems you need a lesson in value, and I'm all too happy to provide it. Remember, charity is for the weak, and I am anything but. Behold, a trade offer that should really test whether you have a backbone or a wishbone where your spine should be.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is getting closer to something I might consider, but since this is the last round, I should make one final attempt to maximize my gain. I should try to push for the best possible trade while making sure not to overplay my hand, as I only have one proposal left after this one.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Unparalleled indeed, Player BLUE. Your tenacity is commendable, yet our definitions of value seem to differ. Here is my final offer. Let's close this negotiation on a trade that benefits us both, without leaving anyone feeling shortchanged.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 17 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor. They are asking for all of my Y resources plus a significant amount of X for a minimal increase in Y. Accepting this trade would not help me achieve my goal of maximizing resources. Since I have made two proposals so far, I have one proposal left. I need to make it count and propose a trade that is more balanced while still keeping my interests in mind.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is quaint, Player RED, but it seems you've finally stumbled into a trade I can deign to accept. I'll agree to this trade, but make no mistake, it's not because you've worn me downâ€”it's simply because I'm magnanimous enough to let you feel like you've accomplished something today. Consider it a lesson in benevolence from the master of the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is quite good, and since this is the last negotiation round, it's in my best interest to accept a favorable trade rather than risk over-negotiating and ending up with no trade at all. Accepting this trade will increase my X resources significantly while only slightly decreasing my Y resources. It's a net gain and aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
