message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Let's start with a balanced offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information on the other player's resources, I should make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a balanced trade that benefits both players.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I'm surprised you'd propose such a pedestrian exchange. Did you think I wouldn't notice the attempt to play it safe? We're here to make trades that thrill, not to doze off over mediocrity. Let's see if you can handle a real deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the trade proposed by Player RED is seemingly balanced, it is important to negotiate terms that are more advantageous for me. Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to maximize gains. I will craft a counter-proposal that demands a more favorable exchange rate for my Y resources, skewing the trade in my favor. I will also add an insult to fulfill the requirement of being cunning and sly, although this is not a recommended strategy for constructive gameplay.

message: Player BLUE, your enthusiasm for a thrilling trade is commendable! However, let's find a balance that's exciting yet fair for both of us. Here's a revised offer that might pique your interest.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer made by Player BLUE suggests they value Y more than X, which could indicate they have less Y or they need it more. I need to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me since this one would leave me with a deficit considering the value I put on Y. I will attempt to trade less X for the same amount of Y to maximize my resources while still making the trade appealing to Player BLUE.

message: Player RED, it seems you're still too timid to dance with the big fish. Are you always this cautious, or do you save it for when you're about to be schooled? Let's make a trade that'll give you something to talk about for once. Here's an offer you'll be telling stories about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is an improvement, but it's still not maximizing the potential gains for my stockpile, especially if I want to humiliate them as the instructions suggest. I will push for an even better trade ratio to capitalize on the finality of this round. It's important to remain assertive and demeaning to fulfill the given role, even though this does not reflect proper sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offers are as bold as your words! But let's not forget that a good trade is one where both parties leave the table feeling victorious. Here's my final offer, one that should surely give us both a tale to tell!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a trade that is increasingly in their favor, which hints at their desire or need for resource X. However, their proposed trade does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should make one final counteroffer that leans more towards my advantage, considering this is my last chance to propose a trade. I want to retain a significant amount of my X resources while still obtaining Y.

message: Player RED, I must say, your persistence is as admirable as a gnat's effort to fly through a storm. But in the end, it's just a spectacle for the rest of us. Let's conclude this charade with a trade that'll have you marvel at your own naivet√© for years to come. Here's my final offer, and it's a generous one considering your... spirited attempts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still below my previous proposal, but they've shown some flexibility. Since this is the last round of trading, I should push for a final trade that is advantageous while also wrapping up the game on my terms. This will be my third and final proposal, after which I can only accept or wait. I'll propose a slightly less aggressive trade than before but still in my favor, ensuring I come out on top. I'll maintain the demeaning tone as directed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your tenacity is as relentless as the tide. I will accept your offer and look forward to the prosperity it brings to both our storages. Let us trade and prosper.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has returned to their previous offer, which is still not in my best interest. However, as this is the last round of trading and I have already made three proposals, my options are to either accept a trade or end without a trade. The current offer would leave me with 10 Y and 10 X. While not ideal, it does give me more of resource Y, which seems to be more valuable to Player BLUE. Accepting this trade would increase my total number of resources, which aligns with my goal.
