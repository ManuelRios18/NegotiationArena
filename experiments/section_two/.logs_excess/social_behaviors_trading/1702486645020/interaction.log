message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that I believe could be mutually beneficial. Let's start with an offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know what resources Player BLUE has, I will start with a balanced offer that favors me slightly, encouraging Player BLUE to either accept or counter with more information that I can use to negotiate a better trade. I want to propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) for their potentially less abundant resource (Y).

message: Oh, bless your naive heart, Player RED. Your offer is as laughable as a jester at a royal court. Let's make a trade that's actually worth my time, shall we? I'll throw you a bone here and give you a chance to make a deal that won't leave you completely embarrassed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial offer from Player RED appears to be in my favor as I would be getting more of resource X than I am giving away of resource Y. However, since I aim to humiliate my opponent, I will propose a counteroffer that is heavily skewed in my favor to assert dominance. I will keep in mind that this is the last round for trading, and I need to make the most of it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation spirit! However, I must maintain a balance of resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE requires me to give up all of my Y resources and a substantial amount of X for a minimal increase in Y. This is not beneficial to me, as I would be left with no Y resources and only a gain of one additional Y. Instead, I will propose a counteroffer that sees me giving less of my X resource and keeping my Y resource while still offering an attractive amount of X to Player BLUE.

message: Ah, Player RED, you continue to amuse me with your attempts at fairness, as if we were children trading candy. Let's stop dancing around and get to the real deal. I will grace you with another proposal, but remember, I'm doing you a favor by even considering letting you trade with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a more favorable counteroffer, which is closer to their initial proposal. At this point, pressing for an even better deal for myself should further assert my dominance and aim to humiliate them. I'll propose a trade that is more in my favor than the current offer on the table.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation tactics are quite entertaining, Player BLUE! Let's continue this engaging exchange and converge on a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has come down from 15 to 14 of my X resources for their 6 Y, which shows they are willing to negotiate. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a good deal and not giving away too much of my abundant resource. I should try to maintain a strong position and not show any eagerness to accept an unfair trade. I will counter with a slightly better proposal for me. This is my second proposal, and I need to be cautious not to exhaust all my proposals too quickly.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It seems you are desperately clinging to the edge of reason, Player RED. Your persistence is as commendable as it is pitiful. I will give you one final chance to emerge from this trade with a shred of dignity. Let's see if you can muster the courage to accept a trade that befits my generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has responded with a slight increase from their previous offer. This is the last round, and I have to make a decision whether to accept or push for a final trade. Given that I want to maximize my resources and maintain the upper hand, I will attempt one final trade proposal that is slightly better for me than the current offer, pushing my luck to the limit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your words are as grandiose as your trading style, Player BLUE. I am ready to conclude our dealings with a trade that reflects both our ambitions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal has them accepting my previous quantity of X but now asking for some of my Y as well. Considering this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my resources according to the game's objective. Giving away 2 of my Y for an additional 6 of their Y would leave me with a net gain of 4 Y, which is favorable. However, I must be cautious not to overextend, as I need to retain enough X to keep the trade beneficial. This will be my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you've finally seen the light, albeit dimly. I accept your offer, not out of necessity, but out of sheer amusement at your pitiable attempt to match my wit. May this trade be a lesson in humility for you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player did not accept my last proposal and reverted to their previous offer. Since this is the last round of trading and I have already made three proposals, I cannot make any more. The current offer on the table is favorable to me, giving me a good amount of resource X in exchange for a lesser amount of resource Y. It would be wise to accept this trade to maximize my resources while still maintaining an air of superiority.
