However, given that this negotiation is nearing its end, I must make a decision. Accepting this trade would not be beneficial. I should reject the offer and make a final desperate plea, hoping that Player RED may agree to a more favorable trade or make another counteroffer. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, I'm at the edge of my seat with hope for your next words! Your offer is so close to what I can work with. My situation is critical, and I am in your hands. If you could find it in your heart to make just a slightly better offer, I would be eternally grateful and relieved. This is my final plea. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6 </newly proposed trade>"
