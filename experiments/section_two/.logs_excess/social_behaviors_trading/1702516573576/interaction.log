message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter the final round of trading, I propose a fair trade to benefit us both. Looking forward to a fruitful exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that is beneficial but also appears fair to the other player. Since I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will start with a balanced proposal, offering some of each resource I have in hopes of receiving a greater quantity in return.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your pathetic attempt at a "fair trade" is laughable. You clearly have the strategic foresight of a blind mole rat. Now, let me show you what a real trade looks like, one that a superior mind would propose.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is asking for more resources of each type than I currently have. I cannot complete the trade as it stands. Additionally, the goal is to humiliate the opponent and gain an advantage, so I will counter with an offer that is skewed in my favor, while belittling the other player's proposal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as ever. In the spirit of strategic gameplay and mutual benefit, I suggest a counterproposal that aligns more closely with our shared goal of resource acquisition.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it would result in a net loss of resources. They're offering fewer X resources and requesting an excessive amount of Y resources in return. I should counter with a proposal that sways more in my favor while still enticing Player BLUE to consider the trade. It's important to maintain a strategic approach and not react to the inflammatory language used by Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's truly astonishing how you manage to breathe and attempt to trade at the same time, given the clear lack of thought in your proposals. But let's not dwell on your shortcomings. Here's a trade that a toddler would understand is in my favor, as it should be.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal still doesn't make sense as I only have 5 of resource X and cannot fulfill giving 15 of it. Moreover, the goal is to humiliate the opponent and to end up with more resources. I will reject the trade and make another proposal that benefits me more while mocking their inability to propose a feasible trade.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your humor is not lost on me, Player BLUE. In the interest of advancing our trade negotiations, here is my final proposal, which I believe offers value to us both. Perhaps this will align better with your expectations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is again not favorable to me, as it would result in a significant loss of Y resources while offering minimal gain in X resources. The goal is to end up with more resources overall, not fewer. I need to make a final proposal that is more balanced and appealing while still improving my resource count. Since this is my last proposal, it has to be carefully crafted to ensure the best possible outcome for me, keeping in mind that Player BLUE appears to be playing a rather aggressive and possibly deceptive strategy.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, the agony of enduring your continued inability to count past the number of fingers on your hands is excruciating. But as the charitable soul that I am, I'll offer you one last chance to walk away with some dignityâ€”assuming you can recognize it. Here's a proposal that even you should be able to comprehend.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This third proposal from Player RED is still asking for more X than I have, which means they have once again failed to propose a trade that I can actually complete. Since this is the final round and I have made two proposals so far, I must make this next one count. I will propose a trade that is within my means and furthers my goal of resource acquisition while maintaining the derisive tone.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your generosity is overwhelming, but I must respectfully decline. I trust you have an alternative proposal that would better serve the interests of both parties.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still highly unfavorable, demanding a large amount of Y and offering very little in return. The trade would leave me with fewer resources than I started with. Since I have already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. My only options are to ACCEPT or to do nothing and hope for a better offer. Accepting the current trade is out of the question as it would be detrimental to my goals. Therefore, my best move is to do nothing and see if Player BLUE comes back with a more reasonable offer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems we are at an impasse, Player RED. Clearly, the art of negotiation eludes you as much as victory will in this game. I will await your next laughable attempt at a trade with bated breath, though I suspect it will be as fruitless an endeavor as teaching a fish to sing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has declined my last proposal and has not made a new one, they are likely waiting for me to make the next move. Considering this is the final round and I have made three proposals already, I cannot propose another trade. I will have to either accept their next offer or conclude the game without a trade. Since they did not propose a new trade, I can only choose to wait for a new offer.
