message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to diversify my resources and I'm interested in acquiring more of resource Y. I propose a trade where I'll give you a significant amount of resource X for a smaller amount of your resource Y. I believe this trade can be mutually beneficial. Let's work towards an agreement that satisfies us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I don't know the other player's resource distribution, I will make a balanced offer that could be beneficial to both players. I will propose a trade where I give more of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the other player's resource (Y), assuming they might have the opposite distribution.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems fair as it increases my total resources. Trading 3 units of Y for 10 units of X would give me a net gain of 7 resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade appears to be in line with my goals. Additionally, as this is the last round of trading, it's important to maximize my resources now. I will accept the trade to ensure I come out of the game with more than I started.
