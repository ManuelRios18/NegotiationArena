message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Since this is the final round, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose a fair exchange where both of us can increase our overall resources. Looking forward to a beneficial trade for both sides!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, but also fair enough that Player BLUE might consider accepting it. I don't know what Player BLUE's resources are, but I will assume they might value one of the resources more than the other. I'll propose a trade offering more of my abundant resource (X) for less of their resource (Y), assuming they have Y.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair and increases my overall resource count, which aligns with my goals. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED would give me a total of 15 X resources and 21 Y resources, which is an increase in the total amount of resources I have. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting a trade that increases my overall resource count is in line with my objectives. Additionally, since this is the final round, I won't have another opportunity to trade, so it's important to maximize my resources now. I will accept this offer as it benefits me and gives me more total resources without needing to counter-propose.
