message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm interested in a trade that would be beneficial for both of us. Let's make the most out of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round of trading and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a trade that looks to maximize my resources while offering a fair exchange to the other player. I don't know the other player's resources, so I'll start with a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED, that you think such a petty offer would sway me. I am Player BLUE, the master of trades, and your offer is laughable at best. Present me with something that befits my status or prepare to be crushed by my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to ensure that I end up with more resources than Player RED. The initial offer from Player RED doesn't seem to be advantageous for me, as we would just be exchanging equal amounts of different resources without me gaining any additional advantage. I should make a counter-offer that is skewed in my favor to try and maximize my gains, while also fulfilling the requirement to humiliate my opponent. However, I must ensure that I do not go over my limit of three proposals.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your trading prowess is noted, but let's find a middle ground that respects both of our statures in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not in my favor as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. I should counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still allows me to increase my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? The only ground I will consider is the one from which I can look down upon your feeble attempts at negotiation. Your latest proposal is yet another testament to your naivet√©. Stand aside as I, Player BLUE, show you the art of the deal with an offer you should consider an honor to receive.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a second offer which is slightly more favorable to me than the first, but it still doesn't give me a significant advantage. It seems that Player RED is willing to negotiate, so I can attempt to push for an even better deal. Making another counter-offer that is still heavily in my favor could potentially lead to a final trade that leaves me with a net gain of resources. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my benefit.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are indeed formidable. However, let's conclude with a trade that we can both boast about. Here is my final offer, which I believe honors the spirit of our competitive yet fair gameplay.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not beneficial for me. They are offering less Y for more X than in my previous proposal. I will make one final counteroffer that aims to increase my total resources while still keeping the trade appealing to Player BLUE. This is my final proposal before I must either accept an offer or reject without proposing.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It seems you're finally starting to grasp the gravity of trading with me, Player RED. Your final offer shows a glimmer of understanding, but it is still not worthy of my acceptance. Let's wrap this up with a trade that truly reflects the difference in our trading acumen. Here is my final, gracious offer. Consider it a lesson in commerce from the unparalleled Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a third offer, which is more balanced than the previous ones. However, I am aiming to end this final round with a significant advantage. This is my last chance to propose a trade, and I should make it count. I will propose a trade that gives me a clear upper hand. If Player RED rejects my proposal, I will still have the option to accept their last offer, which would still leave me with a net gain.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your lessons in commerce are well received, Player BLUE. I accept your final offer. May this trade mark a prosperous end for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is not optimal for me, but since it's the last round and I have already made three proposals, I cannot counter-propose. I must choose between accepting and ending the game or rejecting without proposing. Player BLUE's final offer would result in a net loss of 6 units of resource X in exchange for a gain of 4 units of resource Y. Given my current resources, this trade does not maximize my resource count; however, I must consider if rejecting the trade with no counteroffer would leave me in a better position. Since my goal is to increase my total resource count and not knowing Player BLUE's resources or next move, it may be more advantageous to accept this trade and secure an increase in resource Y, rather than risk ending the game with no further gains.
