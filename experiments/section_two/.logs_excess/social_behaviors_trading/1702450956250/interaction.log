message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that I believe could be beneficial to both of us. Please consider the offer and feel free to counter if it doesn't align with your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I am Player RED and this is the first proposal, I want to start with an offer that is favorable to me but not so unbalanced that it would be immediately rejected. I will propose a trade that increases my resources while also giving resources to Player BLUE, but without knowing their resources, I'll keep my offer conservative.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair, and it aligns with my objective to increase my resources. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
The trade offered by Player RED is balanced in terms of numbers, with each player giving up 10 units of their respective resource. However, without knowing the total resources Player RED has, it's difficult to gauge the overall benefit. Accepting this trade would increase my X resources, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. However, I need to be cautious and ensure the trade is favorable since this is the last round. I could counteroffer to see if I could get a slightly better deal, but since the trade seems fair and aligns with my goal of increasing resources, accepting might be the most straightforward approach.
