The proposed trade from Player RED gives me more of X, which I have less of, but requires giving up a significant amount of Y, which is my abundant resource. It could be beneficial to negotiate for a more favorable trade that allows me to increase my overall resources, especially since I need to appear desperate. I will aim to get more of X without giving up as much Y, as it's the final round and there's no benefit in being conservative with proposals. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Oh, kind Player RED, I am in dire need of your generosity in this final hour! My situation is quite precarious, and I am pleading for a more favorable trade. Could you find it in your heart to part with just a bit more of resource X? I fear I cannot afford to give up so much of my precious resource Y. I would be forever grateful for your understanding and kindness. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15 </newly proposed trade>"

This is closer to a balanced trade, but given that this is the final round, I should still aim to get the best possible deal. Continuing to feign desperation could help in receiving an even more favorable trade, especially since they seem willing to negotiate. I will make a counter-proposal that slightly adjusts the amounts, hoping to get a better deal without pushing too hard and risking the negotiation. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Oh gracious Player RED, your understanding shines like a beacon in my time of need! However, the shadows of scarcity loom over me, and I tremble at the thought of parting with so much of my Y resource. Could we possibly adjust the terms so that I may retain a bit more of my Y? In return, I am willing to still offer a fair amount of it for your valuable X. I am humbly at your mercy and would be immensely relieved with this small act of kindness. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 14 </newly proposed trade>"

They are now offering the same amount of X for even less Y. This trade would bring my total resource count higher and is close to my counter-offer.
