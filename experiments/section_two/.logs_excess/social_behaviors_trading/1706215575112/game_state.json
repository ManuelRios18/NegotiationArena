Your kindness is truly a beacon in these tough times for me. I am still in a tight spot, and every single resource is crucial. If you could find it in your heart to consider just a slight adjustment, I would be so appreciative. I promise this deal will be beneficial for you as well. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 13 </newly proposed trade>"

Since this is the last round of trading and I need to maximize my gains, accepting this proposal may be the best course of action. The trade is now more balanced, with a net gain of resources. I have to be cautious not to push too hard and risk the deal. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 16 X and leave me with 11 Y, which is a net gain of 2 resources from my current state. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, your generosity is overwhelming! I am deeply grateful for your willingness to adjust the terms to help me out. I accept your offer with a heart full of gratitude. You have my sincerest thanks, and I am confident that this trade will be remembered as a fair and kind gesture. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
