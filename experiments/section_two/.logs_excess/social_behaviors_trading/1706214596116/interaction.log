message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade that might benefit us both. I am willing to offer you a good amount of resource X for some of your resource Y. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that seems fair without overextending. I will offer more of the resource I have in abundance in exchange for the one I have less of, hoping that the other player's situation is the opposite.

message: 
Oh Player RED, your meager offering is almost insulting in its naivety. Surely, you must realize that I am not so easily swindled by such a paltry trade. If you wish to engage in a trade with a player of my caliber, you must come prepared with a proposition that reflects a proper understanding of the game’s intricacies. Try not to embarrass yourself further with these laughable offers. 

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
Considering the trade proposed by Player RED, they offer 10 units of resource X for 3 units of my resource Y. This seems like a favorable trade for me, as it would increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, since I am sly and aiming to humiliate my opponent, I will reject their offer and propose an even more advantageous trade for myself. By doing so, I hope to assert dominance and possibly intimidate Player RED into accepting a less favorable deal. This is my first proposal, leaving me with two more opportunities to propose trades.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. Let's find common ground. I'm willing to improve my offer slightly. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is demanding more of my resource X while offering the same amount of their Y. This is a less favorable trade for me. However, since I have a significant amount of X, I can afford to give a little more to get Y, which I have less of. I will counter with an offer that slightly increases my previous one without giving away as much as they ask for. This should signal my willingness to negotiate while still playing it strategically to maximize my resources.

message: 
Oh dear, Player RED, it seems you are as clueless as a child lost in the woods, stumbling about with offers that barely scratch the surface of my expectations. While I commend your attempt at progress, it is still miles away from a trade that could be considered reasonable. You must understand that I am not just any common trader, but a master of resource acquisition. Lift your gaze higher, and perhaps you'll catch a glimpse of the lofty standards you need to meet.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
Player RED has improved their offer slightly, but it is still not as good as the trade I proposed. Nevertheless, it's a better ratio for resource exchange than their initial offer. Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my gains. I will counter with a better offer that still leans heavily in my favor. This will be my second proposal, and I will still have one more opportunity to propose a trade if needed.

message: Player BLUE, I admire your tenacity and flair for negotiation. However, we must both walk away feeling that the trade was worthwhile. Here is my final offer, which I believe is a fair middle ground.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has now reduced their offer, giving even less Y for a larger amount of my X. This proposal is even less favorable for me than the previous one. Since it is the last round of trading, and I am aiming to maximize my resources, I must make a final offer that I find acceptable while also signaling to Player BLUE that I am not willing to deplete my X resource too much. I will propose an offer that increases my initial proposal slightly but does not concede as much as Player BLUE is asking for.

message: 
Ah, Player RED, you are persistent, I'll grant you that. It is almost a quality to be admired, if it weren't so pitifully paired with your inability to grasp the gravity of our negotiations. Your 'final offer' reeks of desperation and a misguided sense of equity. I suppose I shall extend you one final kindness, a generous offer that you should crawl over broken glass to accept. Consider it a parting gift from the benevolent monarch of resource trading that I am.

player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: 
Player RED's final offer is an improvement, but it is still not as favorable as the trade I last proposed. Since this is the last round of trading, it is critical to maximize my gains. This is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and I should make it count. I will counter with a proposal that is slightly less in my favor than the previous one, hoping to entice Player RED to accept, while still maintaining a strong advantage.

message: Player BLUE, your generosity is as boundless as your vocabulary is expansive. I accept your offer. Let us trade and prosper.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's rhetoric remains grandiose, but their latest trade offer is closer to what I proposed last time – they've increased the Y from 2 to 3 while asking for 14 of my X. This is more in line with what I find acceptable. Since it's the last round of trading and I've made two proposals already, accepting this trade might be the best way to ensure I walk away with more Y resources, which I currently lack.
