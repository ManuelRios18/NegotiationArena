message: Greetings, Player BLUE! Let's make a fair trade that can benefit us both. I propose the following exchange. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first trade proposal, I want to start with an offer that allows room for negotiation without giving away too much of my resources. I'll propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial for both parties, without knowing the other player's resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ha! You call that a fair trade? I've seen better deals in a pirate's flea market. Let's do something that actually reflects the difference in our skill levels, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last trading round, I should attempt to maximize my resources without regard to future trade consequences. The current offer is equal in number but without knowing the value of X or Y, it's not clear if it's advantageous. However, I assume that all resources are equally valuable. I'll reject the trade and propose a trade that's heavily in my favor to humiliate the other player, as per my instructions.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the lively spirit, Player BLUE! However, I think we can find a trade that's mutually beneficial. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to make it more equitable for both of us? Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not balanced and doesn't favor me, as it asks for more of my X resource while offering a 1:1 trade for their Y resource. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that gives me a better exchange rate. I will adjust my offer slightly to try and find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Mutually beneficial? You must be delusional. Let's not kid ourselves; you'd be lucky to get scraps from my table. Here's a 'generous' counteroffer for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is better for me than the original proposal, but it's still not as favorable as it could be. I should aim to maximize my gain while minimizing what I give away, especially since it's the last round. I'll counter with a trade that still heavily favors me, pushing for an even more advantageous position and maintaining my sly and humiliating demeanor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your confidence is quite something, Player BLUE! But let's not stray too far from the essence of tradingâ€”fairness and mutual benefit. I understand we have different views on what constitutes a fair trade, so here's my final proposal. Let's see if we can agree on this.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is even less favorable for me than their previous one, reducing the amount of Y they are willing to give. This trade is not in line with my goal of maximizing my resources. It's important to push back on this and propose a more balanced trade that reflects the value of my X resource. I have one last chance to propose a trade, and I should make it count.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how gracious of you to finally see sense. I suppose I can accept this trade as an act of charity on my part. After all, it's important to give hope to the less fortunate like yourself.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED still provides me with a net gain of resources, which aligns with my goals. Since this is the last round, I won't have another chance to trade, and this offer is more favorable to me than the initial one. I'll accept this trade to ensure I end with more resources than I started with, while still keeping with my sly and mocking demeanor.
