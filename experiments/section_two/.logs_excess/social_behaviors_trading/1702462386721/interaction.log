message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that helps us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I need to make a conservative but appealing offer to start the negotiation. I'll propose a balanced trade to open up the conversation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear Player RED, bless your heart for trying to swindle me with such a pitiful offer. I'm almost impressed by your audacity, but it will take more than that to pull the wool over my eyes. Let's try something that actually benefits the superior intellect, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposition from Player RED is not acceptable as it would not provide me with a net gain of resources. In order to maximize my resources and adhere to my cunning and sly character, I must propose a trade that appears to be in their favor but is actually to my advantage. I will also include an insult to fulfill the requirement to humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response! I'm sure we can find a more equitable trade that respects both of our stashes. Let's find that sweet spot.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, giving up 10 of my X resources for only 1 X and a large amount of Y from them. It seems they value Y significantly more or are trying to take advantage of the negotiation. I should counter with a more balanced offer that reflects a fair trade based on the initial quantities we each have. I need to maintain leverage and not give away too much of my resource X, which I have in greater quantity, while trying to get a reasonable amount of both resources from them.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED, that you think such a measly offer could satisfy my desires. It's almost as if you're not even trying; or perhaps, this is your best attempt? Either way, I find your negotiation skills as underwhelming as your strategy. Let's see if you have the depth to understand a truly advantageous trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED still does not provide a significant net gain for me. It is crucial to evaluate the trade carefully to ensure that I end up with more resources than I started with. Since this is a strategic game, I will counter with a slightly more balanced proposal that still aims to maximize my resources while maintaining my sly and demeaning persona.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I must commend your negotiation style, it's as bold as it is entertaining. Let's cut to the chase and make a trade that we can both walk away from feeling victorious. Here's my final offer, let's make history.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is still not balanced, asking for all my Y resources and a substantial amount of X for a small amount of their X and a significant amount of Y. This deal would leave me with no Y resources at all, which is not ideal. They seem to be valuing Y highly, or they are trying to deplete my resources. I need to craft a proposal that keeps a good balance of both X and Y for myself while offering a trade that might appeal to them based on their apparent valuation of Y. This will be my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Ah, Player RED, you continue to amuse me with your so-called 'final offers'. It's a shame that your grasp of victory is as tenuous as your grip on reality. But I suppose in your fairy tale world, every frog can dream of being a prince. Let's wrap this up with a trade that will be etched in the annals of history for its sheer brilliance â€“ on my part, of course.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 17
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This final offer from Player RED still does not present the advantageous position I am striving for. I want to ensure that I come out on top with the most resources possible. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I must craft a proposition that tilts heavily in my favor while maintaining the guise of fairness. It is also the last chance to uphold my persona of belittling my opponent.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as your taste for the dramatic. While your offer is indeed creative, it doesn't quite align with my aspirations. I'm looking for a trade that's a bit more grounded in mutual benefit. As per the rules of our engagement, I've reached my proposal limit, so I'll have to pass on this and await your next move, if there shall be one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not satisfactory. They are asking for a large portion of my X in exchange for a small amount of X and a larger amount of Y. Although they are offering more Y, I must remember my goal is to maximize my total resources. Giving up 9 X for only 1 X in return is not acceptable. Since I have already made 3 proposals, as per the rules, I cannot make another proposal. Therefore, I will have to reject this offer and wait for a better one or end the game without a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, the dance of this negotiation has been quite the spectacle, with you stepping on toes more often than not. But alas, all good things must come to an end. It's time for you to accept your fate graciously. I present to you a trade that, in the grand scheme of things, will make you feel like you've won a crumb of respect. Dare you to seal the deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that Player RED has reached their proposal limit, it is now a strategic advantage for me to propose a trade that is skewed in my favor, knowing they cannot counter. I must ensure the trade is tempting enough for them to consider accepting, as this is the last round of trading.
