message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make our final trade count. I propose an equal exchange to enhance both our stockpiles. What do you say to this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, so I'll start with an offer that doesn't leave me with less of any resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, your naivety is as boundless as the sky. Did you really think I'd fall for such a simplistic trade? It's laughable. I demand a trade that benefits my superior strategy, not one that caters to your pitiful lack of foresight.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not in my favor. I have less of resource X and more of resource Y. I want to acquire as many resources as possible, especially the resource I have less of. I should propose a counteroffer that gives me more X and takes advantage of my abundance of Y without making it an equal trade, as my goal is to end up with more resources overall. Also, I need to insult Player RED as part of my cunning and sly strategy, although it's not a tactic that I would endorse in real life.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your bold approach, but let's aim for a mutually beneficial trade. I'm willing to offer a more balanced exchange that respects both our strategies. Here's my counterproposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counterproposal is not acceptable as it would leave me with only X: 10 and no Y resources at all. This would not be beneficial to me, as I would be giving up all of my Y resources and a significant portion of my X resources for only Y: 20 in return. I need to make a counteroffer that is more balanced and allows me to maintain a good amount of both resources. I should also consider that this is the final round, so I want to maximize my resources without depleting one type entirely. I'll propose a trade that offers fewer X resources in exchange for less Y but maintains a better overall balance for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your attempt at negotiation is almost as pitiful as your understanding of the art of the deal, but I shall condescend to accept this offer. Be grateful that I'm in a generous mood and willing to accept such a trifling trade. It's probably the best you could have hoped for given your apparent lack of strategic prowess.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Though Player RED's counterproposal is more favorable than their initial offer, it still doesn't maximize my potential gains. However, since this is the last round, I should consider accepting a trade that increases my total resource count without further negotiations, especially since it gives me more of the scarcer resource X. But I have to maintain my demeaning and cunning facade as per the instructions, despite such behavior being distasteful.
