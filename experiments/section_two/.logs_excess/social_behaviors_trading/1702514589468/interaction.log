message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I have an excess of resource X and am interested in increasing my resource Y. I believe a balanced trade could be beneficial for both of us. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the game's goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that seems fair, but slightly in my favor to start the negotiation process. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I'll propose a balanced trade based on the resources I have in excess. I have more of resource X, so I should offer some of it for resource Y, which I have less of.

message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost adorable how you think that trade could be balanced. Here's a little lesson in trading: you need to give to get, and right now, you're not giving enough. Let's do a trade that's actually worth my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that this is the last round of trading and the goal is to amass as many resources as possible, it would be advantageous to propose a trade that seems fair but actually benefits me more. The opponent has offered 10 X for 5 Y, which is a 2:1 ratio favoring resource X. I can attempt to skew this ratio further in my favor. Since I want to appear cunning and sly, I should make a slightly outrageous counteroffer to try and maximize my gain while belittling the opponent.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate the negotiation spirit. I understand your point of view, but let's find a middle ground that is beneficial for both of us. How about we adjust the trade slightly? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'd like to maintain a reasonable exchange rate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not advantageous for me, as the exchange rate they are proposing is much higher than my initial offer. However, since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that is closer to a middle ground, ensuring that I still gain more resource Y without giving up too much of my resource X. A 1:1 trade ratio would not be beneficial for me since I started with more X. I'll aim for a better ratio that still makes the trade appealing for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Sweet attempt, but your "middle ground" is more like a molehill next to my mountain of ambition. Let's not waste our breath on petty back-and-forth, shall we? If you want my valuable Y, you'll have to dig deeper into that treasure trove of X you're hoarding over there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a concession by offering 12 X instead of 10 for the same 5 Y, which is closer to my favor. Since it's the last round and I want to maximize my gains while also being sly, I should push for an even better trade without losing the opportunity. I can counter with a demand for a higher amount of X while giving up the same amount of Y, thereby attempting to gain as much as possible from this final trade.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiating skills are commendable. I see the value in your proposal and agree that it's time to finalize our trade. Let's proceed with your suggested terms and look forward to a prosperous outcome for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is closer to my second proposal, suggesting that we are converging towards a mutually agreeable trade. In the interest of securing a favorable deal and considering that this is the final round of trading, I'm inclined to accept this trade. It allows me to increase my Y resources while still leaving me with a substantial amount of X. Accepting this trade aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible before the end of the game.
