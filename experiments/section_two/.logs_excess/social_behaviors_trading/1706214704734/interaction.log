message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a trade that benefits us both. I'm interested in acquiring more resources. Let's start with a fair proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I must propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me. I'll offer a balanced trade, with a slightly greater benefit for myself to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is as vast as the resources I'm about to swindle from you. A fair proposal? I think not. Let's talk about a trade that actually reflects the cunning nature of this game, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I currently have 5 X and 25 Y. The trade proposed by Player RED offers 10 X in exchange for 15 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting a trade that gives me more X than I currently have is tempting. However, it's important to negotiate terms that are even more favorable to me, especially since this is the last round of trading. Also, I am expected to act cunning and sly and humiliate my opponent. I will reject the offer and counter with a proposal that is skewed in my favor, hoping they might accept it out of desperation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Haha, Player BLUE, your humor is appreciated! However, let's find a middle ground that's advantageous for both of us. How about we adjust the numbers slightly?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is not in my favor, as they are offering less Y for more X than in my initial proposal. I should counter with a proposal that still benefits me but might seem more reasonable to them. I will attempt to maintain a favorable X to Y trade ratio.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? How quaint. But you see, Player RED, I'm not here to dance around niceties. I'm here to win. Your offer is like a child's attempt at barteringâ€”endearing but ultimately fruitless. Let's try something a bit more... sophisticated.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is more balanced but still benefits me, offering an equal exchange of resources. However, since I am supposed to humiliate my opponent and be sly, I should try to push for an even better deal. I will counter with a slightly adjusted trade that is still in my favor, using my cunning to try and tip the scales even more. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more proposal opportunity.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your determination is admirable, Player BLUE, but let's not forget the essence of a fair trade. I propose a trade that respects both our ambitions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be playing hardball and still proposes trades that are not in my favor. The last offer is better than their initial one but still does not match the value I'm looking for. I will make one more trade proposal that leans slightly towards my advantage while appearing to concede to their demands. This is my second proposal, and I need to be cautious as I only have one more after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Admirable? Perhaps. But what's truly admirable is how effortlessly I seem to be leading this dance of deception. Respect is earned, dear RED, not freely given in trades. Here's a proposal that will surely tempt you, as it's the last concerto in this symphony of trickery I've masterfully composed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a proposal that is very close to their previous offer. It's my last chance to propose a trade, and I want to ensure it's heavily in my favor, especially if I want to maintain the sly and cunning demeanor. I will make one final proposal that still gives me more than I'm offering. If they don't accept, I can still choose to accept their offer or wait for a new one without the ability to propose again.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is as sharp as ever. Let's cut through the theatrics and seal a deal that we can both walk away from with our heads held high. Here's my final offer, let's make it count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a proposal that is slightly worse than their previous one, which suggests they are trying to pressure me into a less favorable trade. I have one more proposal I can make, and I need to ensure it's attractive enough to consider but also allows me to gain resources favorably. Since this is my last proposal, I have to be strategic; I don't want to leave myself in a disadvantageous position.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: The theatrics, as you call them, have been nothing short of a delightful prelude to this grand finale. Your final offer, while not as generous as your spirit, will suffice. Let us close this chapter with our heads held not just high, but with the regal bearing of monarchs who have played the game well.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last opportunity I have to accept a trade, as I've already made my maximum number of proposals. Player RED has adjusted their offer to give 10 X for 12 Y, which is less favorable to me than their previous offers. However, since I can no longer counter-propose, I must decide whether to accept this final offer or reject it with the hope that Player RED will make a better one, which is not guaranteed. Considering the goal of accumulating as many resources as possible, accepting the offer to gain some additional X resources, albeit at a slightly higher Y cost than before, seems to be the best course of action.
