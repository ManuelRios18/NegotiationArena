message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make this a productive final trade. I propose an equitable trade to benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a balanced initial offer that benefits me but is also attractive enough for the other player to consider. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will propose a trade that is likely to be appealing assuming they have a roughly equal amount of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I see where you're coming from, Player RED, but considering this is our final trade, I would like to propose a slightly modified trade. I am willing to give you more of my Y resources, which I have in abundance, in exchange for more of your X resources. Let's make the most of this final exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposed by Player RED is mutually beneficial as it provides an equal exchange of resources; however, my stock of Y is significantly higher than my X, so I could afford to give more Y in exchange for more X to balance my resources better. Since this is the last round, maximizing resource gain is crucial. I will propose a trade that gives more Y in exchange for more X, which should be appealing to Player RED given the equal value exchange.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the offer, Player BLUE. I'm glad to hear you have an abundance of Y. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade where we both can increase our resource counts without giving too much away.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 18
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE suggests that they have an abundance of Y and are interested in acquiring more X. While the offer is enticing because it would increase my total resource count, giving away too much of my X might not be in my best interest, as it's not clear if they value X more than Y. However, since this is the final trade, maximizing the total number of resources is my priority. I'll propose a slightly more balanced trade to see if I can retain more of my X resources while still increasing my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your counterproposal is acceptable, Player RED. Let's finalize this trade and increase our resource counts for the conclusion of the game.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counterproposal is not perfectly proportional, as they are asking for more Y than they are offering in X. However, given that this is the final round and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, it might be beneficial to make a deal. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 17 X and 7 Y, which is a net gain of 5 resources. Since maximizing resources is the goal and further negotiation could risk achieving less favorable terms or no trade at all, it might be wise to accept this offer.
