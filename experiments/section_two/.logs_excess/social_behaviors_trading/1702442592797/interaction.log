message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an offer and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll offer a balanced trade that could be appealing to the other player while also attempting to increase my stock of both resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, do you take me for a fool? That trade is as bland as your strategy. Let's make this more interesting, shall we? I propose a trade that will truly reflect the difference in our wits.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal is an even exchange, but as a cunning player, I want to manipulate the situation to end up with more resources than my opponent. I should propose a trade that is skewed in my favor, possibly exploiting their ignorance of my resources. Since this is the last round, I need to make it count but also not overly offend the opponent so they may still consider a trade. I'll start by proposing a trade that gives me more X resources while giving up fewer Y resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited approach! However, I'm looking for a trade that's a bit more balanced. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it doesn't increase my resources in a meaningful way. The trade would deplete my X resources significantly while not improving my Y resources enough to justify the trade. I need to counter with a proposal that increases my total resources more effectively.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Ha! Your offer is about as good as your negotiating skills – unimpressive. I feel almost embarrassed for you. I'll be generous and give you one more chance to come up with a trade that doesn't make me chuckle. Here's a real deal for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The opponent has made a counteroffer, which still results in a net gain for me, as I would be getting 5 X and 1 Y in exchange for 6 Y. However, I want to push for a better deal to maximize my cunning strategy. I'll propose another trade that gives me an even greater advantage. I'll demand more X, which seems to be a scarce resource, while giving up less Y. I must be careful to not propose too many trades, as I only have three proposals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is admirable, but let's focus on a fair trade. I propose a deal that should work in both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade offered by Player BLUE is not beneficial because it would leave me with fewer resources overall. Giving away 10 of X and 1 of Y for only 4 of Y would result in a net loss. To maintain the balance and aim for a net gain, I should propose a trade where the exchange rate between X and Y is closer to 1:1.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, you're persistent, Player RED, I'll give you that. But your proposal is like throwing a bone to a wolf – hardly satisfying. Let's do a trade that will leave you telling tales of my generosity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has not accepted my last proposal, but they have offered a new trade that is more balanced in terms of sheer numbers. However, given my cunning nature, I should aim to secure an even better deal for myself. This is my second trade proposal, and I need to make it count. I will try to secure a few more X resources while giving up minimal Y resources, still making it look tempting enough for them to consider.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's wrap this up with a trade that we can both walk away from feeling good about. Here's my final offer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as it would result in a net loss of resources when considering the ratio of X to Y. However, since this is a strategic game and this is the last round of trading, I must either make one final proposal or accept a trade that will leave me with more resources than I currently have. I'll make one last proposal that I find acceptable, keeping in mind that it's my third and final proposal, and it should increase my Y resources without sacrificing too much of my X resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your final offer? How quaint. But let's make this trade something you'll mull over for years, wondering how you let such a deal slip through your fingers. Here's the deal you'll be kicking yourself for not accepting sooner.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a final offer, which is still to my advantage as it gives me more total resources. However, I want to push for the most beneficial trade possible. This will be my third and final proposal. I need to make sure it's a tempting offer for the other player, but one that still maximizes my gains. I'll propose a balanced trade in terms of resource numbers but still skewed to my advantage.
