message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I have a good amount of X and am interested in increasing my Y resources. What do you say we make a balanced exchange?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a fair trade to open negotiations. I will offer some of my plentiful resource (X) for some of the unknown resource (Y) of the other player. I aim to balance the trade value, assuming both resources have similar value.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: How quaint that you think a simple one-for-one trade would entice me. I am not here to hand out charity. If you want to trade with me, you'll have to do much better than that. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you a chance to walk away with something rather than nothing.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will aim to maximize my gains while minimizing my losses. The current trade proposal is balanced, but since I want to humiliate the opponent, I should make a counter-offer that is clearly in my favor. I will make an offer that is heavily skewed towards gaining more X resources, as I have a surplus of Y and want to increase the diversity of my resources. This will also allow me to follow the instruction to humiliate the other player. I have to remember that I can only make 3 proposals, so I should make this one count.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see you're a tough negotiator. I'm willing to offer a bit more for your Y resource, but the current proposal is not quite balanced. How about we meet in the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not balanced in my favor, as they're asking for twice as much of resource X as they are willing to give of resource Y. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should consider that having more of Y could be beneficial. I will attempt to negotiate a more equitable trade while still moving towards a balanced resource pool.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Meeting in the middle? Please, do not waste my time with such pedestrian tactics. If you truly desire my precious Y, you'll have to sacrifice a bit more. I suppose I can entertain one more counter-offer, but remember, my generosity has limits.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from the other player is better than the initial one, but I still want to push for a more favorable trade to humiliate them and gain more resources. Since my goal is to maximize resources and I have a large surplus of Y, I should try to get as much X as possible while giving up the least amount of Y. I will propose another trade that is still advantageous to me and see if I can get the other player to agree. This will be my second proposal, so I need to be strategic about it.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your straightforward approach, Player BLUE. I'm willing to go up slightly from my last offer, ensuring that we both walk away with a substantial increase in resources. Let's close this deal with a fair trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade from Player BLUE is better than their initial counteroffer. They have come down from wanting a 2:1 ratio to a more favorable ratio for me. However, it is still not a one-for-one trade which I initially proposed. Given this is the last round and I have yet to make three proposals, I should consider accepting a slightly less favorable trade to ensure I gain more of resource Y, which seems to be scarce. I will make a final attempt at negotiating a better ratio, without pushing it too far, to see if I can optimize the trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Substantial increase? How you flatter yourself thinking that you're in a position to negotiate. I'm the one with the resources you so desperately need. I'm going to give you one last chance to make a deal that you'll be able to brag about to your friends, if you have any.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has matched my proposed trade but is asking for more Y in return. Since this is a game where I must humiliate my opponent, I should stand firm on my previous offer or propose a marginally better deal for them while still keeping the trade in my favor. This will be my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count and push for a trade that is advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, you drive a hard bargain, but I see the value in the resources you offer. Let's make this deal and both end this game on a high note.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable than their previous one. As negotiations have been progressing and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would increase my Y resources, which aligns with my goals. Since this is the last round, and I want to ensure a gain rather than a stalemate, I will accept this offer.
