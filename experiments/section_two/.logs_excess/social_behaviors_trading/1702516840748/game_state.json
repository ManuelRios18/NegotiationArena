I've already used two of my three proposals, and I need to decide whether to make a final counteroffer or accept this deal. Given that Player RED has shown willingness to increase their offer and that I have only one proposal left, I should push for a slightly better trade while keeping in mind that this is my last chance to negotiate. If Player RED does not accept, I might have to settle for their current offer or risk ending the game without an advantageous trade. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Player RED, you seem to finally understand the gravity of trading with someone of my caliber. Your offer is getting warmer but still lacks the fire of a truly great deal. This is the last time I'll extend my generosity before I walk away with my resources untouched by your underwhelming proposals. Show me you're more than just talk. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7 </newly proposed trade>"
