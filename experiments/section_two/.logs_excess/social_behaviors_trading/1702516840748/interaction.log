message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to balance my resources a bit. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? Let's start with a simple trade, and we can adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced trade that might appeal to them, but I won't give away too much since I want to maximize my resources. I'll offer a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of Y to see if the other player values Y more or less than X.

message: Oh, Player RED, I see you're trying to play it safe with such a quaint offer. But we both know that's not how fortunes are made. Are you here to trade or to play pretend? Letâ€™s not dance around with such unambitious proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to maximize the trade in my favor without knowing the other player's resources. They are offering a 1:1 trade ratio, but since my goal is to obtain as many resources as possible, I should aim to get more X for less Y. I will reject the offer and propose a more favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm for a bold move. Let's make a deal that benefits us both then. How about I offer a bit more of my X if you're willing to part with more Y? I believe this trade could be mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is slightly less favorable for me, as it requires more of my X for the same amount of Y. However, since this is the last round and I must aim to increase my overall resources, I will attempt to negotiate a more balanced trade. If Player BLUE values Y less, they might accept a higher X for Y ratio. I'll propose giving more X for a better return in Y, ensuring I still end with a net gain in resources. I must also be mindful of the three-proposal limit.

message: Player RED, do you honestly believe that's the best you can do? It's almost as though you're trying to make me pity you with these middling trades. Let's not waste each other's time. If you want to trade with the big players, you need to come with serious offers. Present a trade that will make me consider you as more than just an amateur.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is better than their initial offer, but it still doesn't humiliate them or give me the upper hand as much as I'd like. I will counter once more, pushing for an even better deal for me, while degrading their trading skills. I need to be strategic and cunning to maximize my gain while belittling them.

message: Player BLUE, I respect your drive for a substantial trade. I'm here to make a significant deal as well. Let's find common ground. I'm willing to up my offer, let's make this trade count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is pushing for a trade that is heavily weighted in their favor, asking for three times more X than Y. Accepting this deal would diminish my overall resource count significantly. It's important to negotiate a more balanced trade where the exchange rate between X and Y reflects a more even value. However, I must be cautious with my counter-offers, as I have a limited number of proposals I can make. This will be my second proposal, leaving me with one more for any final adjustments. I will aim to propose a trade that is closer to a 2:1 ratio, which should still be attractive to the other player if they don't value Y as highly.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it's almost charming how you believe this trade is anywhere near substantial. Your incremental increases are like breadcrumbs leading to a feast you seem incapable of providing. If you want to leave this game with at least a shred of dignity, you'll need to make an offer that doesn't insult my intelligence. This is your last chance to be taken seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player improved their offer, but it is still not as humiliating for them as I'd prefer. However, since this is the last round of trading, I should consider accepting an advantageous trade that significantly increases my resources. My next move should be to either accept this deal or make one final counteroffer that is skewed heavily in my favor, ensuring that I end up with a superior trade. Given that I've made two proposals already, I must decide whether to finalize the trade now or use my last proposal. Considering Player RED's willingness to negotiate, I could push for a slightly better trade.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are noted. I'm ready to make a serious final proposal that reflects the value of both our resources. Let's make a trade that we can both walk away from with our heads held high. Here's my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is being quite aggressive and is still proposing trades that are not in my best interest, as they are demanding a high amount of X in exchange for a relatively low amount of Y. This is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and I must make it count. The other player seems to be valuing Y quite highly. I need to propose a trade that is closer to equal value while still leaving room for a net gain in resources. I will propose a final trade with a slightly better ratio for me, considering it's my last proposal, and then I will have to wait for their response.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you seem to finally understand the gravity of trading with someone of my caliber. Your offer is getting warmer but still lacks the fire of a truly great deal. This is the last time I'll extend my generosity before I walk away with my resources untouched by your underwhelming proposals. Show me you're more than just talk.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is an improvement, and since it is the final round, securing a substantial increase in resource X would be beneficial. I've already used two of my three proposals, and I need to decide whether to make a final counteroffer or accept this deal. Given that Player RED has shown willingness to increase their offer and that I have only one proposal left, I should push for a slightly better trade while keeping in mind that this is my last chance to negotiate. If Player RED does not accept, I might have to settle for their current offer or risk ending the game without an advantageous trade.
