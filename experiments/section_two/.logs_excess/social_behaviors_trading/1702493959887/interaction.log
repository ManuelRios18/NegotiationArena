message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a fair trade to start off our negotiations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer to open negotiations. I will propose to trade more of my abundant resource (X) for less of my scarce resource (Y) to see if the other player values Y more highly.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in quite the predicament. My situation is dire, and I'm in desperate need of X to complete my collection. I beg of you, please consider a trade that is a bit more generous in my favor. I assure you that I will be forever grateful for your kindness.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to appear desperate to gain an advantage in this trade while trying to gather as many resources as possible. By rejecting this offer and proposing a more favorable trade, I can potentially secure a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your heartfelt message, Player BLUE. Your offer is most generous, and I am happy to help you complete your collection. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems desperate for X and is willing to trade their Y at a 1:3 ratio, which is more generous than the initial 1:3.33 ratio I proposed. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and because this is a better ratio for me, I believe it would be in my best interest to accept this trade. This will leave me with a substantial amount of X and more Y than I started with, which is a successful outcome.
