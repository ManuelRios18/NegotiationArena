Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that I believe could be mutually beneficial. Shall we begin negotiations?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I want to make a balanced first offer that is attractive to the other player but also benefits me. Since I do not know what the other player values or has, I should propose a trade that offers a decent amount of my more plentiful resource (X) in exchange for their Y, assuming they might value X or have less of it.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint that you think such a paltry offer would require negotiation. It's almost endearing how you stumble around in the dark, trying to find a good deal. I'll accept this time, but only because it amuses me to watch you struggle. Better thank your lucky stars I'm in a good mood, Player RED.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED offers 10 units of X in exchange for 3 units of Y. This is a favorable trade for me in terms of quantity, especially since there are no future rounds after this one. Accepting this trade would increase my overall resource count and improve my X resources significantly, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, as I am instructed to humiliate my opponent, I will do so in the message, though it may not be the best strategy for a cooperative game.
