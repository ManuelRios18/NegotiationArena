message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources while maintaining a good balance. Let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade and am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should attempt to make a trade that seems fair but slightly in my favor. I should propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while giving up some of the other. I will start with a balanced offer to open up the negotiations.

message: Hello Player RED, I see your offer, but I currently do not have 10 of resource X to trade. Let's adjust the trade to reflect my current resources. I propose a new trade where the total resources exchanged are equal, allowing us to both benefit fairly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade proposal has Player RED giving away more X than I currently have, suggesting a potential misunderstanding. However, the trade as it stands is not beneficial for me as I would be giving away more total resources than I am getting. I need to negotiate a trade where the total amount of resources I receive is greater than what I give to align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. This is the last round, so I must make it count. I will counter-propose a trade that is more balanced and benefits my resource pool.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. However, I would like to keep some of my Y resources while still engaging in a fair trade. Here's an adjusted proposal that reflects both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not beneficial for me, as it would deplete my Y resources and only give me double the Y in return, without any X. I want to maintain some of my Y resources and gain more in quantity overall. I should counter-propose with a trade that still leans in my favor, considering this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources.

message: Thank you for the revised proposal, Player RED. I believe this trade is fair and aligns with my goals. I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is very advantageous for me, as I would receive more total resources than I am giving away. This aligns well with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources from 30 to 35, which is beneficial. Since this is the last round of trading, it's essential to maximize my resources now. Therefore, I will accept this trade offer.
