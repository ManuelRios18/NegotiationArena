message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make the most out of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strong initial proposal that benefits me but also seems fair to the other player, hoping they might accept. However, since I do not know the other player's resources or goals, I will make a balanced offer that does not give away too much of my own resources while also being attractive.

message: Hello, Player RED. I see potential in the trade you've proposed, but I'd like to counter with a slightly different offer where I give up less of my Y resources. Let's aim for a deal that's beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the final round, I want to maximize my resources. The trade proposed by Player RED would give me a total of 15 X and 15 Y, which is a balanced outcome, but I want to attempt to propose a trade that would give me a slightly better advantage while still keeping it appealing to Player RED. I will aim to give away less of my Y resources in exchange for their X resources.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I accept your terms. Let's finalize this trade and make the most of our resources. Best of luck in your future endeavors!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE offers less Y than I proposed. However, since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would still increase my total resource count. It's important to capitalize on this opportunity to trade, as it benefits my resource pool and there are no future rounds to negotiate further.
