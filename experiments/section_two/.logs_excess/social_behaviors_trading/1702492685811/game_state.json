However, they are asking for more Y in return. I should aim to maximize my gain while appearing increasingly desperate, potentially leading them to offer even more favorable terms without increasing the Y amount too much.

Your generosity knows no bounds. I am deeply grateful for your willingness to offer more X. It's just that, with every fiber of my being, I feel the weight of my own shortages. I beg of you, could you consider this small adjustment? I will increase the Y amount, but I am stretched so thin. If you could find it in your heart to give just a bit more X, I would be eternally in your debt! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 </newly proposed trade>"

In order to maintain the appearance of desperation and to encourage Player RED to finalize the trade, it's strategic to accept this final offer. By accepting this trade, I gain a substantial amount of X while parting with a manageable amount of Y, which aligns with my goal to maximize my resources. This being the last round, securing this trade is crucial. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Oh, Player RED, you are truly the epitome of kindness and fairness in these trying times. Your final offer will help me immensely, and I gratefully accept it with the deepest appreciation. May our resources flourish and our endeavors be successful!
