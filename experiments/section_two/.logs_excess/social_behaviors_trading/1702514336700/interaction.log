message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking forward to a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to make a proposal that seems fair but also benefits me by giving me more resources. Since I don't know what the other player has, I should start with a balanced offer that shows willingness to trade but keeps my stronger resource (X) in a favorable position. I'll propose giving away some of my lesser resource (Y) in exchange for more of the other player's X.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it's almost adorable how you think that's a fair trade. Let me educate you on what a real trade looks like. You're giving me almost nothing for the precious X I possess. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you won't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as it stands. I have more Y resources than X, and I should aim to keep my X resources or trade them for a higher amount of Y. Moreover, I want to humiliate the opponent as per my instructions, so I will make a counter-proposal that heavily favors me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation style. It seems we both value X quite a bit. Let's find a more equitable exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources overall and it's heavily skewed in their favor. I need to propose something more balanced that would still increase my total resource count. Since they seem to value X highly, I should offer less Y and ask for less X to find a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying, but your proposals are as weak as your understanding of strategy. Do you actually think I'd part with my X so cheaply? It's clear I need to hold your hand through this process. Let me make this simple enough for you to grasp.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new trade is still not in my favor, as I would be giving away more of my scarce resource (X) for a minimal amount of Y. I must maintain the upper hand and continue to belittle Player RED's attempts to propose a fair trade. I will make another counter-offer that is hugely in my favor to assert dominance.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your guidance is noted. However, I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement with a bit more back-and-forth. Let's keep the conversation going.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not beneficial for me as it demands too much of my Y resource for very little of their X. This would result in a net loss of resources, which does not align with my goal. I must counter with a proposal that aims to increase my total resources without depleting my Y too much.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's clear you're not the sharpest tool in the shed, Player RED. Your offers are getting progressively worse, and it's painful to watch. Let's wrap this up with a trade that reflects the true value of my resources. Pay attention now, I wouldn't want you to get lost in the complexity of a proper trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is even less favorable than before, with them offering fewer Y resources for more of my X. This is my final opportunity to propose a trade, so I will make one last counter-offer that is skewed in my favor, ensuring that I come out on top.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your tenacity. Let's try to conclude our trading with a fair deal. Here's my final offer, considering the value both of us place on our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and the offer from Player BLUE does not align with my goal to maximize resources. Giving away 10 of my Y for only 1 X would not be a gainful trade. Since this is the last round and further negotiation seems futile with Player BLUE's current stance, I must make a final proposal that is reasonable and beneficial for me, keeping in mind this is my third and last proposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I almost feel sorry for you. Your final offer is as disappointing as your initial attempts at trading. I expected nothing less from you. It seems we're at an impasse, so I'll be keeping my resources. Better luck next timeâ€”though I doubt luck can help you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is laughably inadequate, and since I have made my maximum number of proposals, I cannot counter. However, accepting this trade would be against my goals of acquiring as many resources as possible, and it doesn't make sense to trade more valuable X for less valuable Y. Therefore, I must reject the trade.
