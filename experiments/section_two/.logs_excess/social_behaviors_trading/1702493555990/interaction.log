message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources and would like to propose a fair trade to benefit us both. I hope we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that appears fair and enticing to Player BLUE, while also attempting to increase my overall resource count. Since I don't know Player BLUE's resources, a balanced trade might involve offering a decent amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for a smaller amount of their potentially less abundant resource (Y). This could set a cooperative tone and potentially lead to a favorable trade.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in dire need of diversifying my resources as well! Your offer is intriguing, but I'm concerned that I'm not getting enough X to meet my urgent needs. Could we possibly adjust the terms? I'm really hoping for your understanding and generosity in these trying times!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to appear desperate to get a better deal than what's being offered. This trade is not favorable as I would be giving up a significant amount of my Y resources for a smaller amount of X. I will attempt to propose a counteroffer that appears desperate but is actually in my favor, aiming to get more X without giving up too much Y.

message: Dear Player BLUE, I understand the importance of diversifying our resources and I am willing to help. I accept your proposed adjustment in the spirit of mutual benefit and cooperation. Let's finalize this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is requesting more of my X resources, which indicates they might have a higher need for X. Since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to make it count. I should consider accepting a slightly less favorable trade to ensure that a trade happens at all, as long as it still increases my overall resources. By giving away 12 of X and receiving 2 of Y, I am still within my means to grow my resources, though I must be cautious not to give away too much.
