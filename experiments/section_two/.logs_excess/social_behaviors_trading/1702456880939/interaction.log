Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a fair trade to kickstart our negotiations. Let's work together to achieve a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As the first proposal, I want to set a fair trade to open negotiations and show goodwill. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has or needs, so I'll propose a balanced trade that benefits me slightly but also appears attractive to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED. It seems you're as adept at trading as a toddler is with quantum physics. Let's make this a bit more interesting and profitable for me, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable as I would be giving away double the amount of resource Y for an equal amount of resource X. I want to propose a trade that is more favorable to my goals. This will be my first proposal out of the maximum three allowed. I will also include an insult to fulfill the requirement of humiliating my opponent, although this is not in good spirit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Your wit is as sharp as your trading spirit, Player BLUE. However, I'm sure we can find a more equitable arrangement. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it offers a worse exchange rate than the initial proposal. I aim to acquire more resources, but this trade would leave me with fewer overall resources. I need to counter with a proposal that swings the balance back in my favor while still being enticing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? I'd rather not stoop so low as to walk a path trodden by the mediocre. But let's indulge in your fantasy of fairness for a moment longer. Here's what a 'generous' deal from me looks like.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed a 1:1 trade, which is closer to a fair trade, but my goal is to maximize my resources, not to trade equally. I will counter-propose something slightly more in my favor. This will be my second proposal. I will continue the trend of including an insult to degrade my opponent as per the instructions, despite it being against good sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your generosity is noted, Player BLUE, but true magnanimity would be a trade that leaves both parties feeling victorious. Let us not wade in the waters of mediocrity but sail towards a profitable horizon for us both. Here's my final offer, let's make history with a trade that will be remembered for ages!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not in my favor; it's slightly better than their first counteroffer but not as balanced as my previous proposal. Since this is the last round of trading and I have a limit of three proposals, I should make a final offer that leans more towards my advantage but still presents a reasonable trade to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Victorious? You wouldn't know victory if it was served to you on a silver platter with a side of conquest. But alas, I shall bestow upon you one final chance to bask in the shadow of my benevolence with an offer that will echo through the ages as the moment you almost struck a commendable bargain.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is back to a 1:1 trade, which is not in my best interest. I will make one final counter-proposal that is beneficial to me, keeping in mind this is my last allowed proposal. The insult, distasteful as it may be, will be included to meet the game's requirements.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your eloquence is commendable, Player BLUE, but I'm afraid your offer still doesn't align with my goals. I must seek a trade that brings me closer to victory, not just the illusion of it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's offer still demands more X than they're offering in Y, which is not beneficial to me. However, as this is the last round of trading and I've reached my limit of three proposals, I can either accept an offer or propose nothing further. Since the current offer is not to my advantage, I should not accept it. I must either wait for a better offer or end the negotiation without an exchange, as it would not serve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you're unable to grasp the gravity of the situation, Player RED. Victory is not within your reach, for you squander opportunities as a fish would a bicycle. But go ahead, take your time. I'll wait for an offer that's actually worth my consideration, though I suspect it's as likely as you developing a keen sense of trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not accepted my final proposal and has not made a new offer, and I have reached my limit of making proposals, my only options are to either accept a trade that Player RED proposes or hold onto my current resources. Given that no trade has been proposed, I will not be accepting anything this turn.
