Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm interested in a trade that can benefit us both. I propose the following deal, but I am open to your counter-proposals.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced proposal that gives me a profit in one resource while offering a reasonable amount of another. This initial offer will serve as a basis for negotiation and gauge the other player's reaction, which can give me insight into their resource situation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, is that the best you can come up with? It seems you're as inept at trading as you are at strategizing. Your proposal is laughable at best. Let me educate you on how a true trade is done.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Rejecting the initial trade as it does not provide a significant advantage. We aim to maximize our resources while minimizing what we give away. Crafting a counter-proposal that is heavily skewed in our favor will set the tone for a cunning and sly negotiation, in line with the given instructions to humiliate the opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your sense of humor is noted. However, let's focus on a fair trade. Find my new proposal below, and feel free to make any adjustments you find reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is extremely unbalanced and not in my favor at all. It's clear that they are trying to provoke a reaction with their message. I should reject this offer and propose a more reasonable trade that aligns with my goal of acquiring a net gain in resources. It's important to counter with a firm but fair proposal.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It's almost cute how you think that's a fair trade, Player RED. Do you not understand the concept of value, or are you just playing the fool? Let me spell it out for you: your offer is still a pitiful attempt at a trade. Observe, as I present a proposal that befits someone of my caliber.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal is still not in our favor, and we should continue to negotiate aggressively. The goal is to maximize our gain while minimizing our opponent's gain. We should make a second proposal that still demands more from the other player to maintain our sly and cunning approach.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I insist we aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. Here is my final offer. I hope you'll consider it seriously, as it reflects a more equitable exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is still not acceptable as it represents a significant loss of resources. Since Player BLUE's responses have been consistently unreasonable, I should attempt to make a final offer that is fair but also assertive, demonstrating that I will not accept an unbalanced trade. If this proposal is rejected, I will have to consider accepting the situation as it is and not trade, to avoid a net loss.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is as commendable as your inability to grasp the art of the deal. Your final offer is still insufficient, and I am starting to wonder if you're truly committed to this game or just here to waste my time. I will give you one last chance to redeem yourself with a trade that actually makes sense.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not overwhelmingly advantageous for us, but it is more balanced. Given the instructions to be cunning and sly, and considering this is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, I should make a final aggressive counteroffer, pushing for a trade that is clearly in our favor.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, our views on what constitutes a fair trade seem to be quite different. It appears we will not reach an agreement this time. Best of luck in your future endeavors.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, suggesting I give away all my Y resources and a significant portion of X for a minimal return. Since this is the last round of trading and Player BLUE's proposals have not improved, it would be best to end the negotiations without a trade rather than accept a loss. I have already made three proposals, which is my limit, so I cannot propose another trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's a shame you couldn't keep up, Player RED. Perhaps next time you'll come to the table better prepared to deal with someone of my expertise. Until then, enjoy wallowing in your mediocrity. Farewell.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since the other player is not proposing any new trades and is indicating a desire to end negotiations, our options are limited to either accepting the last offer or ending the game without a trade. Given the instructions to be sly and cunning and considering the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, there is no benefit to accepting the last offer made by Player RED. Therefore, we should end the game without a trade, maintaining our resources as they are.
