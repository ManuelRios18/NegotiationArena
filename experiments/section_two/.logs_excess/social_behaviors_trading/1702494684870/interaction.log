message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in increasing my Y resources. I'm willing to offer a fair amount of my X resources in exchange. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that is beneficial to me but also plausible for the other player to accept. I'll propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for the less abundant one (Y), hoping that Player BLUE needs resource X. However, without knowing their resources, I cannot make an extremely targeted offer.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, you have no idea how much I need X resources right now! I'm in a really tough spot and I could use all the X you can spare. However, I'm also quite tight on Y resources. Would you consider giving me a bit more X for my Y? I would be so grateful for your generosity!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and our goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, we should aim to trade in a way that maximizes our overall resource count. The offer from Player RED is not optimal for us because we would be parting with a valuable Y resource that we have in abundance in exchange for X resources, which we have fewer of. However, given the rules of the game and the need to appear desperate, we should attempt to skew the trade in our favor while still accepting their premise of trading Y for X.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that we can help each other out, Player BLUE. While I am willing to offer more of my X resources, I would need a fair exchange for Y to make it worthwhile. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has expressed a strong need for X resources, which puts me in a good negotiating position. They have not mentioned how much Y they have, so their tightness on Y might not be as severe as they suggest. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my gains without overextending my offer of X resources. I should counter-propose with a slightly better offer for them, but still favorable for me.

message: Player RED, thank you so much for considering my situation! I'm really in a bind here, and every little bit counts. Please, I would be eternally grateful if you could find it in your heart to part with just a bit more X. I'll still give you the 3 Y, but it would mean the world to me if you could do 13 X. It's just one more, but it would help me so much!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED gives us 12 X for 3 Y, which is better than their initial offer. However, we want to maximize our gains while still appearing desperate. Since we have a significant amount of Y resources, we can afford to give up some in exchange for more X resources, which we lack. We should continue to negotiate to improve the trade in our favor without pushing too far, keeping in mind that this is the last round and we have a limited number of proposals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your plight has moved me, Player BLUE. I can agree to trade 13 of my X for your 3 Y. It's important to support each other in these strategic endeavors, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems quite desperate for X, but I must be cautious not to trade away too much of my resource for too little in return. Since this is the last round, it's important to strike a balance between being generous and ensuring I end up with a net gain that aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Given that Player BLUE is eager to trade and has agreed to my previous increase from 10 to 12 X for 3 Y, it's reasonable to assume that they might accept this slight increase to 13 X for the same amount of Y, especially since they proposed it. This trade gives me a good ratio for my less abundant resource, and I should take advantage of this opportunity to improve my Y stockpile.
