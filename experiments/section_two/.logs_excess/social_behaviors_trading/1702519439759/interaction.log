message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to make an initial trade offer that could benefit us both. However, since I'm not aware of your resources, I'm making a guess to start our negotiations. Feel free to make a counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must make a strategic proposal to maximize my resources, considering that I don't know the other player's resources. I'll start with a balanced offer to open the trade.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I had expected someone with a bit moreâ€¦ intellectual prowess. Your offer is so pitifully unbalanced that it's almost adorable. You must be jesting! I can't possibly accept such a laughable trade. Let me show you how a real strategist operates. Pay close attention; maybe you'll learn something.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to create an overwhelming advantage and insult the other player to humiliate them while also ensuring I don't accept an unfair trade. Since this is the last round, I should attempt to maximize my gains and aim to make my opponent feel lesser in the process. The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources; thus, a counteroffer is necessary. To maintain a dominant position, I will propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm and spirit. However, your trade does not meet my goals of increasing my resource pool. Let's find a more mutually beneficial arrangement. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer given by Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it does not increase my total amount of resources. I am giving away all of my Y and a significant portion of my X for a smaller amount of Y in return, which is not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will make a counteroffer that is more balanced and aims to increase my total resource count. I will propose a trade that gives me a net positive gain in resources, which is the objective of the game.

message: Oh, sweet summer child, you're still missing the mark by a mile. Do you even understand the concept of trading, or are you just throwing numbers around hoping they'll stick? You should be grateful that I'm even considering continuing this charade of a negotiation with you. But, alas, I'm feeling generous, so let me spoon-feed you a proposal that even you might grasp.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still not in my best interest as it suggests an equal exchange, which does not align with my goals of increasing my overall resource pool. To keep the upper hand and continue the humiliation, I will propose another trade that pushes for a greater advantage on my part while mocking Player RED's negotiating skills.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it seems we have different approaches to trade. I'm looking for a trade that is beneficial for both of us. Let's try this proposal on for size and see if it's closer to what you find acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is still not beneficial for me because it would result in a loss of resources. They are asking for all my Y and more X than they are offering in Y. This would leave me with fewer overall resources and is contrary to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to propose a trade that increases my resource pool while still being fair to the other player. Since this is my third and final counterproposal, I need to make it count and aim for a positive gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Do you even hear yourself, Player RED? I'm starting to wonder if your strategy is just to throw pebbles at a giant, hoping to make an impact. Your offer is another testament to your astounding inability to grasp the basic concept of advantage. It's like watching a puppy play poker - utterly out of its depth. Here's my final act of charity: one last trade proposal that I'm sure even you can't misconstrue as anything but a gift from the gods of commerce.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This latest offer from Player RED is still not acceptable as it doesn't give me a net gain in resources. Given that I want to maximize my resources and humiliate the other player, I will respond with a final proposal that maintains my advantage. This is my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer is appreciated, but it seems we value our resources differently. It appears we will not reach an agreement that satisfies my goals. Therefore, I must respectfully decline your proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE would result in an even exchange of resources by quantity, but it does not improve my total resources since I would be giving up twice the amount of X for half the amount of Y. This trade is not favorable according to my goal. However, since this is the last round and I have already made three counterproposals, my only options are to accept this trade or propose no trade at all. Given that neither accepting nor countering would improve my situation, I will choose not to engage in a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, it's a shame you couldn't recognize a good deal even if it hit you over the head. I suppose some players just prefer to play it safe rather than play to win. Enjoy your mediocrity, Player RED. I'll be over here, basking in the glory of my untapped potential. Farewell.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has declined to make a further trade offer, and since I've already made my maximum number of three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. At this point, the only remaining actions available to me are to accept a trade or do nothing. Given that there is no new trade to accept, and my previous offers have been rejected, the only option left is to do nothing and end the negotiation.
