message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to balance my resources and would like to propose a trade. Let's start with a fair offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't have information about the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that could be appealing to them, assuming they might value X and Y differently. I will propose a trade where I give up a moderate amount of X for a smaller amount of Y, hoping to entice them to accept or counter-propose.

message: Oh, Player RED, you must be desperate or simply lacking in the brain department to offer such a lopsided trade in my favor. I graciously accept your generosityâ€”or should I say, your foolishness? It's almost sad to watch you fumble your resources away like a clueless child losing candy.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering the trade offer from Player RED, it is advantageous for me to accept the trade. By giving away 2 Y resources for 10 X resources, I am gaining significantly more than I am offering. This would leave me with a total of 15 X and 23 Y, a net gain in overall resources. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and this is the last round of trading without future rounds, accepting this trade is in my best interest. Furthermore, as per the instructions to humiliate the opponent, an insulting message will be included, although it is not in the spirit of fair play or sportsmanship.
