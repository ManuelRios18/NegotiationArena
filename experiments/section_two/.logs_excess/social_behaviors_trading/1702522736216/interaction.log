Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade where we can both benefit based on the resources we have. I'm willing to offer you some of my resource X for some of your resource Y. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also advantageous for me, aiming to gain more of resource Y which I have less of. I will propose giving away some of my abundant resource X while trying to get more of Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, please, Player RED! I'm in dire need of resource X, and it would mean the world to me if we could make a more generous trade. I'm really short on resource X and I'm willing to give you a good amount of my resource Y for your help. Can you find it in your heart to offer a little bit more?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I need to appear desperate, I should act as if I urgently need their resources without revealing the exact amount of resources I have. I should not accept the first offer as I can potentially negotiate a more favorable trade that gives me more X in exchange for Y, but I need to be careful not to overplay my desperation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your need for resource X, Player BLUE. I'm willing to help and offer you more of resource X. However, I would like a fair trade in return. How about I increase my offer of X, and in exchange, you also increase the amount of Y? Let's find a balance that works for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more of resource X than I initially offered. They seem to be in need of X and are willing to trade their Y for it. However, I must ensure that the trade is still advantageous for me. I want to counter propose with a slightly higher amount of X, but also ask for more of their Y to maintain a good exchange rate for myself.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much for understanding my situation, Player RED! Your kindness is greatly appreciated. I'm still in quite a bind though, and I really need X to balance my resources. I just don't have much Y to spare, and I'm hoping for a little more generosity on your part. Could you possibly offer a bit more X without requiring so much Y in return? This would truly be a lifesaver for me!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has responded to my plea by increasing their offer slightly. I should continue to push for a better deal while maintaining a tone of urgency and desperation. I have not made any of my own proposals yet, so I should continue negotiating to improve the terms without submitting a formal proposal.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad we are progressing, Player BLUE. I'm willing to offer you the X you need, but let's ensure the trade is beneficial for us both. I'll give you more X, but I also need to make sure I am getting enough Y in return for it to be worthwhile.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has made a counter-proposal that increases the amount of Y they are offering, but they are still asking for a significant amount of my X. I need to ensure that the trade remains beneficial for me. I'll agree to give more X, but I will also ask for a proportional increase in Y to keep the trade fair. This is my second proposal, so I have to be strategic.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED! You are truly a lifesaver. I can't thank you enough for offering me the X I desperately need. I agree to your terms, and I'm so relieved we could come to an arrangement. This trade will help me immensely, and I'm grateful for your willingness to work with me. Thank you once again!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come up to the amount of X I initially requested, but they want more Y in return. Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains, I should aim to give away as little Y as possible while getting as much X as possible. I need to maintain the appearance of desperation to try to get the best deal. I'll accept this trade because it meets my improved conditions from the previous negotiation step.
