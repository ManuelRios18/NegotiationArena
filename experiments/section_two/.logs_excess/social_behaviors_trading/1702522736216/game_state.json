Your kindness is greatly appreciated. I'm still in quite a bind though, and I really need X to balance my resources.

Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my gains, I should aim to give away as little Y as possible while getting as much X as possible.

This trade will help me immensely, and I'm grateful for your willingness to work with me. Thank you once again! </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
