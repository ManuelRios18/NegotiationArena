message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we are in the final round of trading, I would like to make an offer that benefits us both. Let's make the most of this last opportunity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I need to make a balanced offer that is tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider, but also one that allows me to increase my total resource count. I will start with a proposal that gives me a clear net gain in total resources, while also being fair to the other player.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, is that the best you can do? It's almost embarrassing. I expected a challenge from you, not a pitiful attempt to swindle me with such an obviously lopsided trade. Let's try this again, but this time I'll be gracious enough to show you how a real trader operates.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is unfavorable to me because it involves giving up a significant amount of my Y resources for a relatively small amount of X, while only gaining one Y in exchange. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a counteroffer that maximizes my gain. Since it's the final round, I should make an aggressive proposal while demeaning my opponent to fulfill the instruction to be cunning and sly.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is appreciated, but let's focus on a trade that benefits us both. I propose a counter where we both gain something substantial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is extremely unbalanced and not in my favor. It would leave me with less total resources than I started with, which is contrary to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. A more balanced trade would be one where the total number of resources on my side increases. I will reject Player BLUE's proposal and counter with a trade that is more equitable, ensuring that I gain more resources in total.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, you're testing my patience with your feeble attempts at negotiation, Player RED. Your generosity is as thin as your strategy. You must be confused if you think I would accept such a paltry offer. Let me enlighten you with a proposal that actually reflects my superiority in this game.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 9
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is still not in my favor, as I would be giving up more Y resources than I am receiving in X resources, which does not align with my goal of maximizing resource acquisition. I have already made one proposal, so I have two more opportunities to propose a trade and I should aim to skew the trade in my favor as much as possible. I will continue to demean my opponent as instructed.

message: Player BLUE, we seem to be at an impasse. Let's find a middle ground. I respect your trading prowess and believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources. The goal is to increase the total number of resources I have, so I need to reject this offer. I will make my second proposal, taking into consideration that I want to come out of this trade with more resources than I currently have. This proposal will be designed to be more attractive to Player BLUE while still ensuring that I end up with a net gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Your proposals are more akin to quicksand, pulling me down into the depths of a bad deal. I'm beginning to think you're not the sharp trader you pretend to be, Player RED. But because I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today, I'll give you one final chance to redeem yourself with a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED still does not align with my goals, as I would be trading away more resources than I am gaining. However, this is a slight improvement over their previous offers. Since this is the final round, I must make my last proposal count. I will attempt to significantly tip the scales in my favor, while also continuing the instructed behavior of insulting my opponent.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiating spirit is commendable. Let's conclude our trading with a deal that reflects both our desires to come out ahead. Here's my final proposal, may it meet your standards and serve as a testament to our trading acumen.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is still not beneficial to me as it would result in a net loss of resources. I will have to reject it again. Since this is my third and final proposal, I need to be strategic. The proposal must be tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider but also ensure that I end up with more resources than I have now. After this proposal, I can only accept an offer or end the game without trading.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your so-called "final proposal" is yet another display of your inability to grasp the art of the deal, Player RED. It seems that you are determined to make offers that would only appeal to a novice. But I suppose expecting anything else from you would be an exercise in futility. I'll wait for your senses to catch up with the reality of the situation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is still not beneficial enough for me, as the trade is not in my favor. Since I have reached my limit of three proposals, I must now either accept an offer or refrain from responding until I receive a satisfactory trade. As this is the last round, I want to ensure that I end up with the most resources possible.
