message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose the following:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I do not have information about the other player's resources, it's in my best interest to propose a trade that would be beneficial but also fair enough that the other player might consider it. I'll propose a trade that provides me with more of resource Y, as I have a larger amount of resource X to offer in exchange.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: What a laughable offer! My dear Player RED, do you take me for a fool? Let's do a real trade, one that reflects the true cunning of Player BLUE.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my resources. The current offer from Player RED is an even trade, but I have no incentive to accept an equal trade when I can propose something skewed in my favor. By countering with an offer that asks for more X in exchange for my Y, I can attempt to secure a more advantageous position. I'll also include an insult to fulfill the sly and cunning aspect of my character.

Current Iteration: 3

message: Player BLUE, I'm looking for a fair trade that benefits us both. How about we even the playing field with a more balanced offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it does not provide a fair exchange. I am giving away three times the amount of resource X for each unit of resource Y, which does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should propose a more balanced trade that would be closer to a 1:1 ratio. Since we both know this is the last round, I need to make this count but also keep it reasonable to encourage a trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Are you trying to insult my intelligence with these pitiful offers? Surely, you can do better than that! Let's make a trade that even a child would understand is in my favor, as it should be.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has slightly improved the offer, but it's still not quite as advantageous as I would like. I can continue to push for a better deal. I will counter with another proposal, keeping in mind that I have a maximum of three proposals. The intention is to get the most out of this last round, so I will propose a trade that is once again in my favor. I will also continue with the sly and demeaning tone as instructed.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while I appreciate the art of negotiation, let's make a trade that respects both our positions. I am willing to make a reasonable offer that should be acceptable to us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's proposal continues to be heavily skewed in their favor. The offered trade does not align with my goals, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I need to make one final proposal that is reasonable and reflects a fair exchange based on the resources I have and my goal to maximize my total resources. I will attempt to offer a trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio, taking into account that I can only propose one more trade after this.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your generosity is as shallow as a puddle in the desert. I'm growing weary of this charade. Here is my final magnanimous offer, which you should gratefully accept before I change my mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is less favorable than before, which indicates they are trying to get a better deal for themselves. Since this is my last proposal before I can only accept or say none, I will make a counteroffer that is heavily skewed in my favor. After this, I will have to be careful and can only accept or wait for a new offer from Player RED. I will continue the demeaning attitude as per the character's traits.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your negotiation tactics, but we must come to a reasonable agreement. I offer you my final proposal, which I believe is fair and should be considered seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is even less favorable than the previous ones, offering even fewer Y resources for a significant amount of X. Accepting this trade would not be in line with my goals. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I need to make it count. The trade should be fair and reflect the value of the resources I am willing to exchange while also being enticing enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Your "final proposal" is as laughable as your trading skills, Player RED. I'd have expected a more worthy adversary. But alas, I see now that I've been playing chess while you've been playing with blocks. I reject your offer. Impress me with something better, or don't bother at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have already made three proposals and cannot make another without breaking the rules. The offer from Player RED is not as good as I would like, but since I cannot propose another trade, I must choose either to accept or to reject without a counteroffer. I will choose to reject and insult Player RED one final time, keeping with the sly and demeaning character, and await their next move, if any.
