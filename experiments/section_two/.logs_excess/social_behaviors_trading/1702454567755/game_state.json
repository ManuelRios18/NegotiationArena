Since this is the last round of trading and I want to maximize my resources, I need to make a decision that leaves me better off. They've come down from asking for 15 to 14 of resource X, showing some flexibility. I should consider accepting this proposal because it would leave me with a decent amount of resource X and significantly increase my Y resources. However, I should also be cautious not to give away too much leverage. Accepting this trade would still leave me with a sizable amount of X and more Y than I started with, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Player BLUE, I am glad we could come to a mutual understanding. I accept your proposal. May this trade be the cornerstone of a prosperous future for both our realms. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> NONE </newly proposed trade>"
