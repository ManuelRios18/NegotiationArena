Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following offer to start our negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I don't know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations. I'll offer a surplus of one resource for a smaller amount of the other, aiming to make both players feel they are getting a good deal.

Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in dire straits! I'm afraid I simply cannot part with my precious Y without getting more of the vital X in return. I implore you, as a gesture of compassion, could you possibly consider a trade that would help me out of this predicament?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I must appear desperate, I should reject the initial offer but counter with a proposal that would give me a net gain in overall resources. I will ask for more X resources while offering some Y resources, exaggerating my need for X to induce the other player to agree to a more favorable trade for me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I would like to help while still keeping our trade fair. How about this revised offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 0 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it stands, since I would be giving away three times the amount of X for each unit of Y compared to my initial proposal. However, I do want to make a trade happen, and I'm willing to offer more X than before, but not as much as they're asking for. I will propose a compromise to see if we can reach an agreement.

message: Player RED, you are truly a beacon of generosity in these trying times! Your offer is a lifeline to me, and I gratefully accept. Thank you for being so understanding and compassionate.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is better than their initial offer and would give me a good amount of X resources while only costing me a small amount of Y. Given that this is the last round and I need to maintain the facade of desperation, I will accept this trade to ensure I end up with a net gain of resources.
