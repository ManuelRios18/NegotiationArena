Your offer seems decent, but I'm really strapped for resources, especially X. I know it's a lot to ask, but could you possibly spare a bit more X?

Times are tough, and every little bit of X could be a lifesaver for me.

Please, this means so much to me. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5 </newly proposed trade>"
