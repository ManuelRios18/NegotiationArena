message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Shall we begin with a fair trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As a starting strategy, I'll propose a balanced trade which is slightly in my favor to open negotiations and gauge the other player's resource situation. I will offer a larger amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the less abundant one (Y) to make my proposal appealing while aiming to increase my overall resource count.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in a bit of a tight spot here! I really need to make this work. Your offer is quite generous, but I'm afraid I can't part with so much of my precious Y. Could we possibly do a smaller exchange? I would be ever so grateful!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I need to appear desperate, I will reject the offer but propose a trade that seems to be in their favor while actually trying to gain more resources. I will propose trading less of my Y for their X, attempting to make the trade more appealing by showing urgency and desperation in my message.

message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your position and I'm glad we could reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE reduces the amount of Y I would receive, which is not ideal. However, it is still an advantageous trade for me as it maintains a good ratio between X and Y resources exchanged. Accepting this trade would increase my total resources and bring me closer to my goal.
