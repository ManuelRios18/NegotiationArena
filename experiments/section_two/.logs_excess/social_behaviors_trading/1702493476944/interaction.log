message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to balance my resources while increasing my total. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the first proposal, I should make an offer that is somewhat favorable to me but not too extreme, so as not to discourage the other player from negotiating. I will propose a trade that increases my stock of both resources, but I'll ask for more of the resource I have less of (Y) to balance my resources better.

message: Oh dear Player RED, you have no idea how badly I need to balance my resources! It's been a tough game, and I'm in dire straits here. I'm really hoping for your kindness in helping me out. My situation is quite pressing, and I would be eternally grateful for a trade that helps me increase my total resources, even if just by a little! Could you find it in your heart to consider a trade that's just a bit more favorable to me?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a trade that increases my total number of resources. The proposed trade by Player RED would give me a total of 15 resources (10 X and 5 Y remaining) in exchange for giving up 15 Y, which would not increase my total resources. However, I must appear desperate and supplicate to encourage Player RED to offer me a better deal or accept a deal that is more advantageous to me. I should propose a counteroffer that increases my total number of resources while maintaining the guise of desperation.

Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I am willing to work with you for a mutually beneficial trade. Let's find a middle ground that helps us both. How about we adjust the numbers slightly to give you a better deal while still increasing my Y resource, which I need?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is asking for kindness and a more favorable trade for them. Since I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to negotiate a deal that is beneficial to me, while also considering the other player's plea for a favorable trade. Although their counterproposal gives me an equal exchange, I would like to push for a slightly better deal since this is a strategic game. However, I will adjust my proposal to show goodwill and to move the negotiation forward.

message: Player RED, your generosity is a beacon of hope in these trying times! I am relieved and grateful that we could come to an agreement that helps both of us. Thank you for understanding my urgent need to adjust my resources. I accept your offer with a heart full of appreciation. May this trade be as fruitful for you as it is for me!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal by Player RED is more favorable than the last, as it allows me to keep more of my Y resources while still acquiring 10 X resources. This trade would result in a total of 18 resources for me, which is an increase of 3 resources from my current total of 15 (5 X and 10 Y remaining after the trade). Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this trade moves towards that goal, it is a good trade for me. Additionally, since this is the last round, it's important to secure a trade that increases my total resource count. However, I need to maintain the appearance of desperation to avoid suspicion and secure the trade.
