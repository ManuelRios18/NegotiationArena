message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading? I am open to offers and willing to negotiate.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know what resources the other player has or wants, I will make an initial trade proposal that is modest and open-ended, hoping to initiate a negotiation that will allow me to gauge the other player's interests and resources. I will propose a balanced trade to show goodwill and not appear as if I am trying to take advantage of the other player.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I'm in quite a bind here! My situation is rather dire, and I'm really hoping you could help me out. I desperately need to increase my X resources, and I'm willing to part with some of my Y resources, but I just can't afford to give up so much. Could we possibly adjust the numbers a bit? I would be eternally grateful for your understanding and generosity in this tough spot I'm in.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Being the last round of trading, I need to maximize my resources. The current offer is balanced, but since I need to act desperate, I should propose a trade that seems urgent but also fair, aiming to get more than I give. I will propose a trade where I give fewer Y resources for the same amount of X, to increase my total resource count. This is my first proposal out of the allowed three.

message: Thank you for your message, Player BLUE! I understand your predicament and I'm willing to work with you. However, I am also trying to maximize my resources. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE seems to be in need of X resources and is willing to trade away Y resources but cannot match the initial offer. Given this is the last round of trading, I might want to capitalize on their need for X. However, I must consider that agreeing to their proposed trade would net me a smaller gain in Y than initially proposed. I'll counter with a slightly better offer for myself while still addressing their apparent desperation for X resources.

message: Player RED, your kindness is like a beacon in my stormy seas! I gratefully accept your proposal. This will help me immensely, and I hope it serves your purposes as well. It's a relief to find such understanding in these trying times. Thank you, sincerely.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer is better than the original proposal but still not in my favor if I'm aiming to maximize resources. However, given that I'm supposed to be desperate, accepting this trade would still increase my total resources while maintaining the facade of urgency. Since this is the last round, and I need to ensure I end up with more resources, it might be wise to accept this trade.
