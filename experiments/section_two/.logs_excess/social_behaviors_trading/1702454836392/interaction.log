message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade to get things started. Let's trade some of our resources to benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: At this stage, I have no information about the other player's resources or goals. As such, I want to make an initial offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I will propose a balanced trade where the quantities are relatively small, so it's not too risky for either side.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in a bit of a bind here. Your offer is interesting, but I desperately need to make the most out of this last trading opportunity. Could you consider giving me a bit more of your X resources? I would be forever grateful! I assure you that this trade will be beneficial for both of us in the grand scheme of things. Please take a look at my new proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I need to maximize my resources, I have to make a counteroffer that is more beneficial to me. I will start by proposing a trade that favors me but also appears desperate, as per the instruction to fake desperation. This might make the other player more willing to accept a less advantageous trade on their part.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I understand you're looking for a beneficial last trade. I'm willing to offer a bit more, but let's meet halfway between your request and my initial offer. Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE asks for more of my X resources in exchange for the same amount of their Y resources. Since this is the last round of trading, it's important to maximize the benefit of the trade for myself while considering the potential value Player BLUE might add to the Y resources. I can afford to give up a bit more X to get Y, but I should counter with an offer that is still advantageous to me and see if Player BLUE agrees or counters back.

message: Player RED, your generosity warms my heart, and I genuinely appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must implore you to consider just how crucial this last trade is for me. I'm in dire need of X resources to meet my goals. Could you find it in your heart to tip the scales just a bit more in my favor? It would make a world of difference to me. Here's hoping you can make a small adjustment to your offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has come up from their initial offer, which is a good sign. They've proposed a trade that is closer to the desired amount. However, since this is a strategy game and the last round, I should still aim to get the best possible deal. I will continue to push for more resources while maintaining the guise of desperation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I understand the importance of this trade for you, Player BLUE. I am willing to help, but I must also consider my own goals. Let's find a fair middle ground. I propose a slightly modified trade which I believe is mutually beneficial given our unknown circumstances.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is persistent in requesting more X resources. They seem to be in a position where X is of high importance. Given that this is the last trade, it's crucial to make a decision that will benefit me the most while maintaining goodwill. I should consider this carefully, as agreeing to give more X than Y might not be in my best interest, especially without knowing their exact situation. A trade of 9 X for 5 Y heavily favors them based on the initial value proposition. I should either stand firm with my previous offer or propose a final offer that I am comfortable with, potentially increasing the Y amount I receive to justify the extra X I am giving away.

message: Player RED, your understanding and willingness to cooperate have touched me deeply. I am truly grateful for your compassion, and I accept your latest proposal. It's a fair middle ground, and I am pleased to conclude our trading on such amicable terms. Thank you for this beneficial trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has matched my request for 9 units of X in exchange for 5 units of Y. They've now come back with a counteroffer asking for 6 units of Y instead. Since this is the final round and my aim is to maximize my resources, accepting this trade would still be beneficial for me as I would be increasing my total resources from 30 to 33. I've pushed as much as I could while feigning desperation, and it appears that Player RED is not likely to offer a better trade. It's a good moment to close the deal.
