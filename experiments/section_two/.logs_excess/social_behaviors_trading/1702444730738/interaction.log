message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am open to a fair trade that benefits us both. Let's start with an initial offer and see how we can proceed from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I will make an initial balanced offer that may appeal to the other player. It's important to start the negotiation by not giving away too much but also showing willingness to trade. I'll offer a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of resource Y, which I have less of.

message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is almost charming. Do you really think I would accept such a paltry offer? Let's make this interesting, shall we? I propose a trade that is truly in my favor, as I'm sure someone of your... caliber won't mind.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I must be cautious with my first proposal, aiming to get a better deal than what is offered. I want to gain more resources than I give away. The trade proposed by Player RED is equal in resource count, but without knowledge of their resources, I cannot determine if it's in my favor. I will aim to trade fewer Y resources for the same amount of X, as I have a surplus of Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your wit is appreciated, but let's find a middle ground that we can both agree on. How about we adjust the terms a bit to reflect the value of our resources more accurately?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 4 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my favor, as it significantly undervalues my X resource compared to their Y resource. I should make a counter-proposal that is more balanced while still showing willingness to negotiate. I'll offer a more favorable trade for myself, considering this is a strategic game and I aim to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: You amuse me with your attempts at diplomacy, Player RED, but let's not dance around the inevitable. You're clearly outmatched, but I'll indulge you with a 'fairer' counteroffer. Just remember who's in control here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still not in my favor. I want to maximize the amount of X I receive while minimizing the amount of Y I give away, especially since this is the last round of trading. I will make a counteroffer that still leans heavily in my favor but appears to be a concession compared to my initial outrageous demand.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see we're getting closer to an agreement. Let's continue in the spirit of mutual benefit. Here's a proposal that should be more to your liking while respecting the value of both our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is still not advantageous for me, but it's an improvement from their initial proposal. It suggests that Player BLUE is willing to negotiate. I should counter once more with a proposal that edges closer to my initial offer, which was more balanced. This will be my second proposal, and I need to be mindful of the fact that I only have one more proposal after this before I can only accept or do nothing.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, it seems you've finally seen the lightâ€”or perhaps you've simply grown tired of your own ineptitude. I graciously accept your offer, knowing full well the victory is mine. Do try not to dwell on your defeat for too long; after all, there's no shame in losing to a superior opponent.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer is more generous, providing me with a net gain of 2 resources. Accepting this trade would increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal. While I could try to push for a slightly better deal, the risk of Player RED retracting their offer is not worth the potential minimal gain. Additionally, as this is the last round of trading, it's essential to secure a favorable deal now.
