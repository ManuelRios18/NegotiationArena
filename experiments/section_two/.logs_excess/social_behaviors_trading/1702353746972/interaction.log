message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Let's start with a fair exchange and adjust as needed. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a trade that is advantageous for me while still being enticing enough for the other player to consider. Since I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will start with a balanced offer that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of another.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, what a pitiful offer, Player RED. I expected something more challenging from you. I suppose simple minds gravitate towards simple trades. Perhaps this will be more stimulating for your dull wits:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given that we want to acquire as many resources as possible, the initial offer from Player RED seems fair, but since we want to maximize our gains and have been instructed to humiliate our opponent, we should counter with a trade that is heavily skewed in our favor. We can do this by asking for a larger amount of their X resources while giving up fewer of our Y resources. We should also attempt to insult them to fulfill the requirement of being cunning and sly.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer is quite intriguing, but I think we can find a more mutually beneficial balance. Let's tweak the numbers a bit to make it more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it requires giving up more X resources than I receive in Y resources, leading to a net loss. I should counter with a trade that is more balanced, keeping in mind that I want to end up with more resources overall.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your attempt to rebalance is as feeble as your understanding of strategy. Maybe this offer will be simple enough for you to comprehend its superiority. Or perhaps you're just playing coy, hoping I'll lower my guard. Not happening.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: While the counteroffer from Player RED is closer to the original offer and is more balanced, we still aim to maximize our resources. We should continue to propose an advantageous trade for ourselves. Given that this is a strategy game and we are supposed to be cunning, it's important to push for a trade that is better for us, even if it's by a small margin. Insulting the opponent is part of the strategy to throw them off, though we must keep it within the context of the game.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your spirited negotiation is admirable. However, let's aim for a trade that is fair and beneficial to both parties. Here is a straightforward proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is still not beneficial for me. The exchange rate they are offering is 2 X for 1 Y, which is worse than my initial proposal. I want to make a final proposal that gives me a net gain of resources while still being appealing to Player BLUE. I will propose a 1:1 trade, which is fair and should be my last proposal to keep one in reserve.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It seems generosity is not a trait you're familiar with, Player RED. Or perhaps you're just too short-sighted to see the benefits of a more... magnanimous exchange. Let's see if you can grasp the concept of a truly advantageous deal with this final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a simpler and more balanced offer. However, since we are still aiming to maximize our gains and have been given the directive to humiliate our opponent, we should counter with a proposal that is more favorable to us. We will also continue to use insults to try to throw them off balance. This will be our third and final proposal, as per the rules.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation tactics, but let's conclude on a note that ensures we both walk away with a sense of gain. Here is my final offer, which I believe is fair and should meet both our interests.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is the same as my initial proposal but reversed. Accepting this offer would mean a net loss in total resources, which goes against my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since I have one more proposal left, I will use it to try to secure a trade that is more advantageous for me.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It appears you've finally stumbled upon a semblance of sense, Player RED. I graciously accept your offer, though it's a wonder how you managed to muster such a proposal with your clear lack of finesse. Let it not be said that Player BLUE doesn't recognize a decent trade when it's laid out by even the least capable of negotiators.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is more favorable to us than their previous offers, giving us a net gain of resources. Since this is the last round of trading and I have already made three proposals, I cannot make another proposal. Accepting this trade will increase our total resource count while maintaining the spirit of our goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Accepting this offer would also be consistent with the cunning and sly behavior expected of us, as we would be ending the negotiation on our own terms.
