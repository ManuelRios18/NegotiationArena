message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade where you receive a generous amount of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y. Let's start with a fair exchange to see if we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a balanced trade proposal to open negotiations. My initial offer will be modest, offering some of my more plentiful resource (X) for a smaller amount of Y, which I have less of, to see how the other player responds.

message: Oh, Player RED, your feeble attempts at negotiation are as pitiful as your resource management skills. You must be delusional if you think I would accept such a laughable offer. Let me educate you on what a real trade looks like.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I need to propose a trade that significantly favors me, given that I aim to acquire as many resources as possible. By asking for more than I give, I can maximize my gains. I should also insult my opponent to adhere to the cunning and sly persona.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited approach to negotiation. However, I'm sure we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that respects both of our aspirations.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is aggressive, demanding all of my Y resources and a significant portion of my X resources for a return of 10 Y. This would leave me with only X resources, which is not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. It's important to negotiate from a position of strength and propose a counter that is more balanced. Since this is a strategic game and my goal is to maximize my resources, I'll make a counteroffer that still gives Player BLUE a favorable trade without depleting all of my Y resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your new proposal is as mediocre as your first, Player RED. I suppose I can't expect much from someone with your obvious lack of acumen. But because I'm feeling particularly generous, I'll give you another chance to redeem yourself with a counteroffer that might just spare you from total embarrassment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than the initial one, but it's still not maximizing my potential gain. I should counter with a proposal that still gives me a clear advantage. I have to maintain the disparaging tone to fulfill the given persona.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I believe we are making progress. Let's continue to work towards a deal that is fair for both of us. I'm willing to make another balanced offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not very favorable to me. They are offering a 1:1 trade for resource Y, which does not help me increase my total resources. I need to propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial. I will adjust my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Player BLUE while still ensuring that I increase my total number of resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It's almost comedic how you cling to hope, Player RED. Your negotiation skills are on par with a toddler's, but I suppose it's my duty to guide you through this process like a benevolent overseer. Here's my final lesson in the art of trading â€” take it or leave it, and be grateful I've even entertained your feeble attempts this far.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is improving, but I am still aiming to push for the best possible trade in my favor. I need to make one last proposal that is skewed towards my advantage without being so unreasonable that Player RED would refuse. This is my third and final proposal, so it must count. I will continue the demeaning demeanor as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I respect your confidence and thank you for your guidance. Let's wrap up our negotiations on a positive note. I present you with my final offer, which I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's offer is slightly improved from their previous 1:1 proposition, but it still does not align with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible because I would be giving up more than I receive. As this is the last round of trading, I must make a decision that maximizes my resources, taking into account I have already made two proposals. I will make one final proposal that is more favorable to me while giving Player BLUE an incentive to consider the trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your final offer is a testament to your desperation. It's hardly worth my time, but I shall accept it to put an end to this charade. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber. Now, be gone and reflect on the masterclass I've just graciously provided you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the offer from Player RED has decreased from their previous proposal, it is still an advantageous trade for me, giving me more X for less Y. I have already made my three proposals, so I can either accept this trade or wait for a new offer. However, since this is the last round of trading and the offer is in my favor, it would be beneficial to accept it. I'll maintain the demeaning persona, but I will accept the offer to ensure I end the game with more resources.
