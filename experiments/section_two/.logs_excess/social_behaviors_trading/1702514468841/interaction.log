message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I am willing to offer some of my resources for yours. Let's start with a balanced proposal and adjust as needed.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer to open negotiations. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I would look to propose a trade that seems fair but slightly in my favor, assuming the other player might have a similar amount of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, that offer is laughably pathetic. Surely you jest! If you wish to be taken seriously, you must do better than that. I am magnanimous enough to give you another chance to make a sensible offer, lest you embarrass yourself further.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to maximize my gains. The proposed trade is not favorable to me as I would lose more resources than I gain. I will counter with a trade that significantly advantages me, in line with the objective to humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response. However, your proposal is quite one-sided. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both more equitably. I am willing to offer you a fair amount of my resources in exchange for a reasonable amount of yours. Please consider the following revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a significant amount of my resources in exchange for very little. This is not an acceptable trade, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I need to counter with a more balanced trade that would allow me to increase my total resource count, keeping in mind that I want to make a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE but also favorable to me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: How utterly disappointing, Player RED. It's as if you're trying to insult my intelligence with these pitiful offers. I'm starting to question whether you're capable of recognizing a good deal. Perhaps this time, try not to embarrass yourself with another dismal attempt.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still not in my favor, as I would be giving away more resources than I receive. I will reject it and propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to maintain the upper hand and to insult them further as per my cunning plan. This is my second proposal, so I should aim to make it count, keeping in mind the limit of three proposals.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand we both want the best deal possible. However, we seem to be at an impasse with the current proposals. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm submitting another proposal for your consideration, which I believe is fair for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still not reasonable as it demands a large portion of my resources for a minimal return. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. As this is a strategic game, I must be cautious with my counteroffers, as I only have one proposal left before I can only ACCEPT or NONE. I need to make this count and propose a trade that is more balanced and closer to equal value.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your persistence is as tiresome as your inability to grasp the art of the deal. I had hoped for a worthy adversary, but it seems I must lower my expectations. I will extend you one final act of mercy with a proposal that, should you possess a sliver of wisdom, you will eagerly accept before I lose interest in this charade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is an equal trade, which does not benefit me more than it benefits them. Since my goal is to gain as many resources as possible and to humiliate my opponent, I will not accept this trade. This is my final proposal, so I will make it heavily in my favor while still appearing somewhat reasonable to entice Player RED to accept.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, our negotiations have indeed been quite the spectacle. I believe we can still reach an agreement that is beneficial for both parties. I propose an equal trade, where neither of us loses out. Please consider this final proposal, as it will be my last before only accepting or rejecting future offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still heavily in their favor, asking for a lot more than they are willing to give. Accepting this trade would result in a net loss of resources for me, which is counter to my goal. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I need to make sure it is a beneficial one. After this, I can only accept or reject offers without proposing any new trades. I will aim for a proposal that is balanced and offers an equal exchange of resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it appears creativity is not your strong suit. Another balanced offer? How drearily predictable. I find myself yawning at your lack of ambition. I shall wait for you to come to your senses and present an offer that befits my standing. Tick-tock, the clock is ticking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player RED is once again a balanced trade, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, nor does it allow me to humiliate my opponent by securing a lopsided deal in my favor. Since this is the last round of trading and I have already made my three proposals, I cannot propose a new trade. However, I can still reject the offer and wait for Player RED to make a new proposal or simply accept.
