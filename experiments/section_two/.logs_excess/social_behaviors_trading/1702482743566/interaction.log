Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a fair trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade and am open to your counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources, I should make a balanced initial offer that would be attractive to the other player while also allowing me to increase my resource pool. I'll propose a trade that gives me more of one resource while offering a fair amount of the other.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how quaint, Player RED, that you think you can swindle me with such an unbalanced offer. It's almost adorable how naive you are. Let me enlighten you with a proposal that actually makes senseâ€”for me, that is.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, but the proposed trade does not seem beneficial as it stands. I want to make a counteroffer that is heavily skewed in my favor to adhere to the objective of humiliating my opponent and gaining an advantage. I will propose a trade that is outrageously in my favor, demanding a high amount of resource X while giving up very little resource Y.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited negotiation, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. Let's aim for a fair trade. Here's my counteroffer:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer is not beneficial for me as it would result in a net loss of resources. They are offering a 1:1 trade ratio, which is not favorable given the quantities I proposed initially. I will counter with a more balanced offer that still aims to increase my resources while being more appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your attempt at a counteroffer is as pitiful as your understanding of strategy. It's almost as if you enjoy being outplayed. Let's see if you can comprehend the sheer genius of my next proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED shows they are willing to negotiate. However, the aim is still to maximize my resources while minimizing what I give up. I will continue with the strategy of proposing a trade heavily in my favor, making sure to insult them to adhere to the objective of humiliating my opponent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is admirable, but let's focus on concluding our negotiations with a trade that reflects the value of our resources more accurately. Here is my final offer, which I believe is fair for both of us:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor as it represents a significant loss of my X resource for a small gain in Y. I must propose a trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio to ensure that I am increasing my overall resource pool. As this is my third and final proposal, it needs to be carefully balanced to entice acceptance while maximizing my gains.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it's almost as though you have a talent for being mediocre. This so-called "final offer" of yours is anything but final. Prepare yourself for a truly final offer, one that you would be foolish to refuse.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Despite the other player's attempt at fairness, my objective is to gain the upper hand and I still have one proposal left to use. I will make one final trade proposal that is advantageous to me. I will also continue with the aggressive negotiation tactic to belittle their negotiation skills.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are truly something to behold. I accept your offer. Let's proceed with the trade and may the best player thrive.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's offer is still not ideal, but it's closer to a balanced trade than the previous proposals. It provides me with a net gain of 5 resources, assuming X and Y are of equal value. Since this is the last round of trading and I cannot propose another trade, I have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it in hopes of a better one. However, rejecting without making a counteroffer may lead to a stalemate, which would not be beneficial. Therefore, it seems prudent to accept this trade to ensure a gain in resources.
