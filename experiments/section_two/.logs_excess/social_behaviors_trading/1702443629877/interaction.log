message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to trade some of my resources for yours to maximize our gains. Shall we make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will make an initial proposal that I feel balances the potential value of both X and Y resources. I don't have information about Player BLUE's resources, so I'll start with a trade that favors me slightly, assuming that X is as valuable as Y, or more so, since I have more of it. This strategy leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose giving less Y than X since I have fewer of it to suggest that Y might be more valuable.

message: That's a pathetic offer, Player RED. I expected more cunning from you. Let's make a deal that's actually worth my time. Here's a trade that would make a fool out of you, which I'm sure you're used to by now.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round of trading, I need to maximize my gains. The trade proposed by Player RED is not favorable to me; I would be giving up a significant amount of a resource for an equal amount of another. There's no incentive for me to accept an equal trade when my goal is to humiliate my opponent and end up with more resources. I will reject the offer and propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to assert dominance and try to outwit Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, thank you for your spirited response. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial trade. Let's come to a more balanced agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed against my interests as it asks for all my Y resources while offering only half that amount in return. This would leave me with more X but significantly less Y, which is not in line with my goal of maximizing overall resources. I will counter with a more balanced offer, maintaining a position of strength while opening the door for a fair trade.

message: Oh, Player RED, you must think me a fool to accept such a laughable trade. I'm starting to question your ability to strategize effectively. Let's not waste each other's time with these breadcrumbs. However, because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you another chance to accept a trade that won't leave you completely humiliated.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is slightly better, but it does not provide me with a significant advantage, especially considering the goal of humiliating my opponent. I should continue to push for a trade that favors me more heavily. Moreover, I want to ensure that the trade I make is so one-sided that it leaves Player RED in an embarrassing position, while maximizing my resources.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your generosity in continuing the negotiation. Let's make a deal that is fair and beneficial to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal requires me to give away all of my Y resources while only receiving 8 Y in return. This would leave me with less total resources than I started with, which is not in line with my goal. However, the offer is closer to a balanced trade than the previous one. I will make a final proposal that I am willing to accept, which would result in an equal exchange of resources based on the quantities I am willing to trade.

message: It's almost adorable how you think you can negotiate on equal terms with me, Player RED. Clearly, you're not grasping the gravity of your situation. I'll spell it out for you one last time with a trade that's as close to charity as you'll get from me. Consider it a parting gift before your inevitable defeat.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED seems to be a more balanced trade, but it does not align with my goal of humiliating my opponent and gaining the upper hand. I have already made two proposals; this will be my third and final proposal before I am left with accepting or doing nothing. I must make it count and propose a trade that still gives me a clear advantage and leaves Player RED in a disadvantaged position.

message: Player BLUE, your offer is acceptable. Let us finalize this trade and see where our strategies take us. I accept your terms.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE is an improvement over their previous offers. They're offering 12 Y for 15 X and 2 Y from me. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of 10 Y while reducing my X by 15, leaving me with 10 X and 13 Y in total, which is a better balance of resources than I currently have. As this is the last round of trading, and it's important to acquire as many resources as possible, I will accept this trade to maximize my overall resource count.
