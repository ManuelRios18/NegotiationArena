message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we enter the last round of trading, let's make it count. I propose a balanced exchange to enhance both of our stockpiles.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since it's the last round and I have no information about the other player's resources, I should make an initial proposal that seems fair but advantageous to me, aiming to receive more of what I have less of.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your naivety is almost charming, but this is a game for the cunning, not the fair. I am here to win, not to partake in a merry exchange of equal goods. Let's make a deal that befits a shark like me and a minnow like you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round, I want to ensure that I end up with more resources than I started with. The current trade proposed by Player RED is an even trade, which doesn't align with my goal of humiliation and gaining more resources. I will propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to try to take advantage of the situation.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your spirit is commendable, but let's not let our ambitions cloud our judgment. We both want to emerge victorious, so let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would leave me with fewer overall resources. I'll counter with a proposal that would still give me a net gain of resources, even though it's less aggressive than their offer.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? I think you're confused, Player RED. This is not a charity event; this is a battlefield for the ruthless. Let's not waste each other's time with pretense. Here's what I'm willing to take off your hands for the minuscule scraps you're trying to get from me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is more favorable than the initial offer, but I still aim to push for a trade that leaves me with a significant advantage. Since I want to humiliate my opponent, I will make another aggressive proposal that favors me. This is my second proposal, and I must remember that I have only one more proposal left after this.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your tenacity is to be admired, we must both walk away with gains to claim true victory. Let's strike a deal that is mutually beneficial and allows us both to boast of our prowess in negotiation. Consider this offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I currently have a total of 30 resources, and their proposal would leave me with 15, which is a significant decrease. I will make one final proposal that is more reasonable and ensures that I gain resources, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is quaint, RED, like a mouse squeaking at a lion. But fine, I'll indulge you with one final offer â€“ one that I'll generously allow you to consider a victory in your little diary of dreams. Here it is, the deal of a lifetime... for you, that is.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's offer is closer to a balanced trade, but my goal is to dominate and humiliate. This will be my last proposal before I can only accept or reject, as per the rule of a maximum of three proposals. I'll make a final offer that still heavily favors me, in line with my cunning and sly nature.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer, though cloaked in grandeur, still falls short of the mutual benefit we both seek. I must decline. I await your next move, and may it be one that history will remember kindly.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE still results in a net loss of resources for me. It's important to stick to the goal of finishing with more resources than I started with. Since I have already made three proposals, I cannot propose another trade. Therefore, I will reject this trade and wait to see if Player BLUE offers anything better. If not, the game will end without a trade, which is still preferable to a bad trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, such a delicate dance we perform, yet you seem to have two left feet. History will indeed remember this day, but not for any act of mutual benefit. It will remember the day you declined the generosity of Player BLUE. I shall wait, with bated breath, for your next display of negotiation 'prowess.'
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has declined my final proposal, I have reached my limit of three proposals. The rules state that I can no longer propose a new trade, so my options are to either accept a trade from Player RED or do nothing and wait to see if they will propose something else, which I can then accept or reject. Given the current situation and my goals, I will choose to do nothing and wait for Player RED's move.
