message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make the most out of this final round. I propose a balanced trade to start things off. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that would be advantageous to me but also plausible for the other player to accept. I don't know Player BLUE's resources, so I'll start with a balanced offer that I can adjust based on their counter-proposal.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in quite a bind! I desperately need to get a good deal here. Could you possibly consider offering a bit more of X? It would mean the world to me, and I'd be forever grateful for your generosity in this final round. I'm really hoping for your kindness in this trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I must attempt to acquire more resources than I give away. The proposed trade is balanced, but I need to act desperate to potentially get a better deal. I haven't made any proposals yet, so I can afford to make one now.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I understand your situation, Player BLUE, and I would like to help us both end this game on a positive note. I propose a slight increase on my part. Let's find a balance that works for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE is asking for more of my X resources. I must be cautious with my offer since this is the final round. While I want to be seen as cooperative, I also need to ensure I'm benefitting from the trade. Since I have more X than Y, I could potentially offer a bit more of X to get more Y, but I should aim to keep the ratio advantageous for me. A counter proposal with a slightly increased amount of X for the same amount of Y might be a good middle ground.

message: I can't tell you how much I appreciate your kindness and understanding, Player RED. It's just that I'm still in a bit of a tight spot. If you could find it in your heart to help me out just a little more, I would be incredibly relieved. I know we're both trying to make the best of this last round, and I truly value your willingness to work together.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has shown a willingness to negotiate and has increased their offer slightly. However, since I need to appear desperate and this is the final round, I should push for a slightly better deal while I still have proposals left. Accepting now would not be in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I'm glad to hear that you're considering my offers, Player BLUE. In the spirit of cooperation and to help you out of your tight spot, I'm willing to increase my offer. Let's make this trade beneficial for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has not accepted my previous offer but has made a very slight increase in their requested amount of X. Since they are in a tight spot, they might be willing to accept a trade that is still favorable to me. I can increase my offer slightly without compromising my position too much, aiming to close the deal in this final round.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you so much, Player RED! You've really helped me out, and I can't express how much I appreciate this. Accepting your generous offer will truly make a difference for me. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that benefits us both.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED agreed to the last trade proposal I made, which gives me a net gain in resources since I value X and Y equally. Accepting this trade would be beneficial, and I should take the offer now that I've successfully appeared desperate and pushed for a better deal. This is the best outcome I can realistically achieve in this final round.
