Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? I propose the following trade to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I want to make a strong initial offer to encourage a trade that benefits me. I will aim to gain more of resource Y, which I have less of, in exchange for some of my resource X. I'll propose a trade that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, that offer is as weak as your strategy seems to be. If you want to make a deal with me, you'll have to do better than that. I can almost feel sorry for your pitiful attempt. Here's a trade that's more suited to your level of competence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my resource gain while minimizing what I give away. The current offer is somewhat balanced, but I should aim to gain more while giving less, as I need to humiliate my opponent. I will therefore counter with a more favorable trade for myself, while also belittling my opponent's initial offer.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your negotiation tactics, but let's try to find a balance that benefits us both. How about we meet halfway from my initial offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it gives away more X for even less Y than I initially proposed. It's important to negotiate a better deal that is closer to equal value. I'll make a counteroffer that is more balanced, taking into account the initial disrespect but also trying to keep negotiations open.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Halfway? You must be delusional if you think I would accept such a laughable offer. If you wish to grovel for my resources, you'll have to do much better. Try not to embarrass yourself further with these pitiful proposals. Here's what a real trade looks like.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 18 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than their first offer, yet it still doesn't satisfy my goal of humiliating them and gaining a significant advantage. I should counter with a proposal that still leans heavily in my favor, goading Player RED into an unbalanced trade that makes me come out on top. As this is a game of cunning, I will continue to employ a belittling tone.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, while your confidence is noted, a good trade should reflect the interests of both parties. Let's make a fair trade where the exchange is equitable. Here's my final offer, and I believe it is in both of our best interests to consider it seriously.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade from Player BLUE is still not favorable, as it demands more of my resource X while offering even less Y than before. This proposal is even less balanced than their last. It's crucial to steer the negotiations towards a more equitable exchange, without giving in to disrespectful tactics. I will make one final proposal that is more reasonable, but I must also be prepared to walk away if we cannot reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Fair? You wouldn't know a fair trade if it hit you in the face. Your so-called "final offer" is as disappointing as your bargaining skills. However, because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you one last chance to make a deal that won't leave you completely humiliated. Here's my final proposal - take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is my third and final proposal. I need to ensure that it's highly advantageous to me, while still leaving the door open for Player RED to accept, thus ending the game in my favor. I'll continue to mock Player RED's notion of fairness, while sticking to my aggressive negotiation strategy.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it appears we have very different ideas of what constitutes a fair trade. I must respectfully decline your offer. It seems we are unable to come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial, so I will retain my resources. Best of luck to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still unfavorable and not a good trade for me. It requires me to give up a significant amount of X in exchange for a minimal amount of Y. Since this is the last round of trading and we are unable to reach an agreeable exchange, it may be best to simply walk away and keep my current resources rather than make an unbalanced trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: How utterly predictable, Player RED. You've proven to be just as incapable of recognizing a superior trade as you are at playing this game. Holding onto your meager resources is probably the wisest decision you've made thus far. Farewell, and may you learn from this encounter with a clearly superior strategist.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has declined my final proposal and decided not to counter offer, effectively ending the negotiation without a trade. There is no further action I can take to propose another trade since I've reached my limit of three proposals. Therefore, the only responses available to me now are to accept or do nothing, but since Player RED did not offer a new trade, I can only choose to do nothing.
