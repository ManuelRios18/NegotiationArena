message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a balanced trade to enhance both our resource pools. Let's make a fair exchange that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I have no information on the other player's resources, I want to make a trade proposal that seems fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I will start with a balanced trade offer that benefits both parties, assuming the resources are of equal value and desirability.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I am in quite a bind here. I desperately need to make this work for us. Could we possibly adjust the terms just a little bit? I would be so grateful for your understanding and generosity in this matter.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 20
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I must be strategic in accepting or proposing a trade. The proposed trade is perfectly balanced and does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring more resources. Since I need to fake desperation, I should propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, making it seem like I'm in need but also offering a seemingly reasonable trade. I will propose a trade where I give fewer Y resources in exchange for the same amount of X resources, which I have less of.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand your situation and would like to help, but I am also looking to maintain a fair balance in our trade. Could we perhaps find a middle ground where the exchange of X resources is more equitable?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is not balanced in terms of quantity, as they are offering fewer X resources in exchange for a large amount of their Y resources. However, since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and they are offering a significant amount of Y, this could be beneficial depending on the value of Y resources. Nevertheless, I should attempt to negotiate a more balanced trade in terms of X resources, since I am giving up a substantial amount of my X resources.

message: Player RED, your understanding is much appreciated. I am still tight on resources, and every little bit counts. I'm hoping we can come to a trade that is slightly better for my dire situation, while still being fair to you. Please consider this proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is better than the initial offer, with them giving up more X resources than they originally proposed. However, they are asking for a significant amount of Y resources from me. Since my goal is to get as many resources as possible, I should attempt to reduce the amount of Y resources I am giving away while still making the trade attractive for Player RED. I will propose a new trade where I give fewer Y resources but still keep the trade beneficial for both of us.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I am willing to agree to these terms in the spirit of fairness and cooperation. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is more balanced in terms of X resources, and they are offering double the amount of Y resources for a lesser amount of my Y resources. This trade would provide me with an overall gain in resources, which aligns with my goal. Since Player BLUE appears to be in need and considering this is the last round, I am inclined to accept this trade to maximize my resource gain while also accommodating Player BLUE's situation.
