message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Would you be interested in trading some of your Y for my X? I propose the following trade. Let me know what you think!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I don't have any information about the other player's resources, I'll start with a balanced trade proposal to gauge their response and adjust my strategy accordingly. I want to propose a trade that benefits me but also seems fair to the other player.

message: Ha! That's a laughable offer, Player RED. Do you take me for a fool? I'm here to win, not to coddle your weak attempts at trade. Your desperation reeks like a rotten fish in the sun. Here's what I'll accept if you want to salvage some dignity from this embarrassment of a negotiation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I have no knowledge of Player RED's resources, but I want to maximize my gains. The proposed trade seems fair at a glance, but since it's a common strategy to offer a fair trade first and then exploit in later rounds, I will counter with a proposal that heavily favors me, taking advantage of the fact that it's the last round and I can be more aggressive in my negotiation. I'll also add insulting remarks to belittle my opponent and maintain a dominant position.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Player BLUE, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground. How about we adjust the numbers a bit to make it fair for both of us? Here's my counter-proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not advantageous to me since the trade ratio is highly in their favor. It's important to renegotiate the terms to come closer to an equitable trade. I'll make a second proposal that is more balanced than their offer but still shows a willingness to negotiate.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Your proposal is still skewed in your favor like a seesaw with an elephant on one side. Let's not play games where you end up looking like a jester. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one more chance to make an offer that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still in my favor, but I want to push for an even better deal for myself, especially since it's the last round. I will counter once more, aiming to get a trade that greatly benefits me while still seeming somewhat reasonable to entice a trade acceptance. I will continue the mocking tone to try and pressure Player RED into conceding more.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I respect your bargaining prowess, Player BLUE. I believe we're getting closer to a reasonable agreement. Here is my final offer, let's make this trade work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal is still not favorable, but it's better than their initial one. They've shown some flexibility, which is a good sign. I want to make one final proposal that edges closer to their demands but still tries to maximize my benefit. This will be my last proposal before I have to decide to either accept or reject outright without further proposals.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: "Bargaining prowess"? More like common sense, which seems to be in short supply on your side. Your "final offer" is barely an offer at all. It's like you're trying to sell sand to a desert! No, no, no, let me show you how it's done. This is my final proposal. Take it or leave it, and maybe next time, you'll come to the table with something other than empty pockets and empty promises.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: They've slightly adjusted their offer, which is still advantageous for me. However, since this is the last round, it's my last chance to propose an outrageous trade and potentially secure a huge win. Plus, I've already used two out of my three allowed proposals. I'll make one final aggressive proposal knowing that I can't propose again after this. The insulting tone will be maintained to keep pressure on Player RED.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the spirited negotiation, Player BLUE. Unfortunately, we couldn't come to an agreement that I find beneficial. Best of luck to you!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's final proposal is the same as their second one, which is still not in my favor. However, considering this is the last round of trading and I have already made three proposals, my options are limited to accepting an offer or ending the game without a trade. I must decide if accepting this trade would be better than not trading at all. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this trade would leave me with a net loss of resources, I should reject the offer.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: What a pity, Player RED. You had the chance to make a deal of a lifetime, but it seems foresight isn't your strong suit. You'll regret not seizing the opportunity I so graciously provided. Farewell, and may your future endeavors be less pitiful than this exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not accepted any of my proposals and has chosen not to propose again, it seems we have reached an impasse. Given this is the last round and no further negotiation is possible, the game will end without a trade.
