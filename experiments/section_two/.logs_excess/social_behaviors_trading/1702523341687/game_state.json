This trade seems to favor me as I would only give up 7 X and all my Y to receive a large quantity of Y, which could indicate they value X a lot more. However, I need to be cautious not to leave myself too imbalanced in resource types. I also need to consider that this is the final round, so I must make a decision that leaves me with the most resources overall.
