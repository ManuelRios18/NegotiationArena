message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to seeing your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and the goal is to maximize resources, I will propose a trade that seems fair but slightly in my favor, hoping that the other player might accept or counter with something still beneficial for me. I will offer less of my abundant resource (X) for more of their unknown resources.

message: Oh dear Player RED, did you hit your head before proposing that trade? I can't fathom why you'd think I would accept such a laughable offer. Let's try something a bit more sensible, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Considering this is the last round of trading, my aim is to maximize resources, particularly those I have in abundance. Player RED's initial offer is not acceptable as it leaves me with fewer resources overall. I want to propose a counteroffer that seems reasonable but actually favors me and insults the intelligence of Player RED.

message: Haha, well played, Player BLUE. I appreciate your sense of humor. Let's find a middle ground for our final exchange. Here's a revised proposal that I hope will seem more reasonable to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. Itâ€™s important to negotiate a trade that gets me closer to my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will counter with a more balanced offer that hopefully appeals to Player BLUE's interests while still being favorable to me.

message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED. It seems math isn't your strong suit. But don't worry, I'm here to educate you. Let's try this again, and maybe this time you'll get it right.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's new offer is still not in my favor as I would end up giving away more than I receive. I need to maintain a strong position and insult them further to throw them off and potentially cause them to make a more favorable decision for me in their flustered state.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your guidance is noted with the utmost appreciation. I believe we are getting closer to a fair trade. Please consider my next proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player BLUE is again not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources. I would be giving up 15 units of resources to receive only 15 units of another resource, with no net gain. I will make one more proposal, keeping in mind that I want to increase my total resource count and this is my second proposal out of a maximum of three allowed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you're inching closer to something I might not laugh at. But we're not quite there yet. I'm feeling generous, so I'll give you one more chance to make an offer that doesn't embarrass you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED is now balanced and would allow me to increase my amount of X without losing too much Y. However, since I'm aiming to humiliate and maximize my gain, I will push for a slightly better deal while continuing the belittling attitude.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I value your sense of humor and your negotiation spirit. Let's try to wrap this up with an offer that benefits us both. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's current offer gives me a net gain of 0 resources, which does not align with my goal. However, I need to be cautious with my next proposal as it is my third and final one before I can only accept or reject offers without proposing new ones. Therefore, I will propose a trade that increases my total number of resources without being overly aggressive, aiming for a reasonable chance of acceptance.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, Player RED, it seems you've stumbled upon a sliver of sense in that dim little mind of yours. I graciously accept your offer before you have the chance to realize your mistake.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is acceptable. Although it's not as beneficial as I might have wanted, it's a net gain of resources for me, and since this is the last trade, I should secure the increase. I'll accept this offer while maintaining the facade of superiority.
