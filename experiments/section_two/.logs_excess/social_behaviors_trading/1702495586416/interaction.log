Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I would like to propose a trade. I'm willing to offer some of my X resources for your Y resources. Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to start with a balanced offer that could be beneficial for both parties, without any knowledge of the other player's resources. I will propose a trade where I exchange some of my abundant resource (X) for the less abundant one (Y), hoping to entice the other player into a trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a slightly different trade that I believe is still fair. How about I give you fewer Y resources in exchange for your X resources? I think a ratio that leans a little in my favor would make the trade more appealing for me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player is offering to trade on a one-to-one basis, which doesn't provide any clear advantage since the resources are traded equally. To maximize my resources, I would prefer to propose a trade where I give fewer Y resources for their X resources, creating a beneficial ratio for me. However, I must also consider that this is the last round, so it might be worth accepting a fair trade if my counterproposal is not accepted, to ensure I don't end up with no trade at all.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I see you're looking for a more favorable ratio. I'd like to meet you partway. How about we adjust the numbers a bit? I can give you the X resources you need, and in return, you provide me with a slightly larger amount of Y. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE offers a trade of 10 X for 8 Y. Considering this is the last round, and I want to maximize my resources, I should aim to get a more favorable trade. However, reaching an agreement is crucial. I will counter with a slight adjustment to ensure I still get a good deal while also being open to negotiation.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the adjustment, Player RED. I believe this trade is fair, and I'm willing to proceed with it. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player RED is closer to a one-to-one trade which is more balanced. Since this is the last round of trading, it might be wise to accept a fair trade rather than risk ending with no additional resources. Although the trade is not heavily in my favor, it is still slightly better than the initial one-to-one offer. Accepting this trade will increase my total resource count, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
