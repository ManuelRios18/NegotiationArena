message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make our final trade count. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. Please consider my offer or counter with one of your own.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I don't know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that favors me slightly, to open up negotiation and learn more about the other player's resources and needs.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Your offer is as pathetic as your strategy in this game, Player RED. Do you really think I'd fall for such a pitiful trade? It's time for you to face a real challenge. Here's my counteroffer: let's see if you can handle it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make sure that I end up with the most resources. The current offer from Player RED would leave me with less Y than I started with and only a slight improvement in X. I want to counter with an offer that gives me a net gain in resources. I will also include a demeaning remark to belittle my opponent, as instructed.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your competitive spirit! However, I believe we can find a more equitable trade. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is unfavorable to me, as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. I will reject this offer and propose a more balanced trade, trying to maintain a cordial tone despite their aggressive message.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you, Player RED, to offer such an equitable trade â€“ if we were playing a game for toddlers! It's time to trade like adults. Here's a real offer for you; try not to cry too much when you see it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player RED is more balanced than the previous one, but I still aim to maximize my resources while minimizing the amount I give away. I must also continue with the demeaning attitude as instructed. I have not reached my limit of proposals, so I will counter with an offer that is heavily skewed in my favor, continuing the strategy of trying to humiliate my opponent.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation style is certainly... unique. Let's keep the banter aside and focus on a deal that benefits us both. Here's my final offer, and I hope it meets your high standards.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is significantly skewed in their favor, resulting in a net loss of resources for me. I will need to reject this offer and propose a more balanced trade that still allows me to gain resources. Given Player BLUE's negotiation style, it might be beneficial to offer a trade that seems slightly more favorable to them while still working towards my goal.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you've finally started to grasp the concept of a fair trade, but fair is for the weak! I want a trade that leaves you in awe of my trading prowess. So here's my final offer, which I'm sure will have you admiring my cunning for ages to come!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is a balanced one, offering an equal exchange of resources. However, my goal is to maximize my gains, not to trade on a one-to-one basis. Insulting my opponent is required, so I will continue with a taunting message. This will be my third and final proposal to try to secure a trade that is in my favor.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is truly something to behold! However, let's come to a decision that we can both be proud of. Here is my final proposal for our game-ending trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final offer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, as it would leave me with a net loss of resources. Given their competitive and somewhat mocking tone, I must carefully consider how to proceed. I have made two proposals so far and have one left. I should make this final proposal count, offering a trade that is balanced yet slightly in my favor, in hopes that Player BLUE will consider it seriously.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you've finally worn me down with your relentless mediocrity. Congratulations, you've achieved the impossible: you've made me accept an offer that doesn't make me burst out laughing. Let's close this deal before you have the chance to embarrass yourself further.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has reverted to their previous offer, which I have already countered. Since I have reached my limit of three proposals, I can no longer counter and must make a decision to accept a trade or to end the game without further trades. The current offer is equal in terms of resource exchange, and since I can't counter, I will accept this offer to ensure I end the game with more resources than I currently have. Additionally, I will continue with the humiliating tone as instructed.
