message: Greetings, Player BLUE, I propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. I am willing to offer a larger amount of my X resources for a smaller amount of your Y resources. Let's make this last trade count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and there's no information about the other player's resources, I must make a proposal that seems fair and beneficial to both parties without undervaluing my resources. As X is likely to be more abundant than Y based on my resources, I will propose a trade that offers more X in exchange for Y, aiming to balance the quantities while attempting to increase my total resource count.

message: Oh, Player RED, how quaint that you think you can swindle me with such a small offer. I'm not a fool to fall for this. Look at you, trying to play the generous benefactor. Let's make this trade actually count, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I aim to maximize my resources while minimizing what I give away. The proposed trade seems fair, but I can attempt to gain an even more advantageous position by countering with a slightly altered trade that still seems reasonable. This approach may entice the other player to accept while giving me a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We both seem to value our Y resources highly. Let's find a fair middle ground that benefits us both. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 11 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counter-proposal is not beneficial for me as it offers less Y for more X, which is not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. However, since they have engaged in negotiation, I should make a second proposal that moves closer to a middle ground, showing willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a favorable trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, your attempt at negotiation is as pathetic as a child's plea for an extra dessert. You must mistake me for someone of lesser wit. However, I'm feeling generous today, so I'll throw you a bone. Here's my counter. If you have any sense, you'll see the light and accept.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is closer to their initial proposal than my counteroffer, indicating a desire to get a better deal on their end. I have the leverage to push for a more favorable trade since Player RED has shown willingness to negotiate. I will attempt a second proposal that is slightly less advantageous for them but still within a range that they might consider acceptable. This maintains my cunning and sly demeanor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your humor is noted. However, let's focus on the matter at hand. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that reflects the value of both our resources. Here's another proposal, reflecting a fair trade between us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has simply repeated their initial counter-proposal, which is still not favorable to me. Since this is the last round of trading, I must consider that I have only one more proposal opportunity after this. I need to make a proposal that is more likely to be accepted but still advantageous to me. A balanced trade would be ideal, maintaining a position that values both resources while leaning towards an advantageous trade for myself.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, it seems you have the backbone of a jellyfish, wobbling back to your starting point. Do try to keep up. We both know you can do better than this paltry sum. Let's not dance around the issue. I'll give you one final chance to make this worthwhile, or you can scurry away with whatever dignity you have left.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has reverted to their original offer, which indicates they may not be willing to go any higher with their X resources or any lower with their demand for my Y resources. At this point, I've made two proposals; I have one more proposal I can make before I can only accept or decline without further negotiation. Considering this is the last trade, I should attempt to secure the most advantageous trade possible without going over my proposal limit.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are indeed spirited. I respect your tenacity, but let's conclude this dance with a trade that we can both walk away from as winners. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has now proposed an even less favorable trade, asking for more X in exchange for the same amount of Y. This move is not in alignment with my goals. As this is my final proposal opportunity, I must make it count. The trade must be fair to both sides while still attempting to maximize my resources. Considering Player BLUE's negotiation style, a slight adjustment to my last proposal might be the best approach to reach an agreement.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you continue to amuse me with your feeble attempts at a trade. Do you not tire of this charade? I'm almost insulted that you would think I'd accept such a laughable offer. Here's my final proposal. Take it or leave it, but remember, it's your loss either way.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has now decreased their offer, which is contrary to my interests. Since this is my last opportunity to propose a trade, I must make it count. I will present a final proposal that is slightly more balanced in my favor than the previous ones, but still reasonable enough that Player RED may consider it. If they decline, I can still choose to accept their next offer if it aligns more with my goals.
