message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make this final round of trading count. I propose an even trade to start off. What are your thoughts?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a proposal that is enticing enough for the other player to consider, but also beneficial to me. I have no information about the other player's resources, so I will start with a balanced offer that I can afford and adjust based on their counter-proposal if necessary.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, is that how you think trading works, Player RED? I'm surprised you've made it this far with such laughable offers. Let me show you how a real trader operates. You're going to give me a much better deal than that if you want to walk away with anything at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I want to trick the other player into giving me more resources than they receive. Since this is the last round, I want to tilt the trade heavily in my favor. I will reject the even trade and propose a highly skewed trade, feigning ignorance of fair trading practices. I also plan to insult them to throw them off balance and possibly coerce them into accepting an unfair trade out of frustration.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your confidence is admirable, but the essence of trading is mutual benefit. Let's find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for a large portion of my resources while offering significantly less in return. This is not a beneficial trade for me. Since my goal is to maximize my resources, I need to counter with a proposal that is more balanced and still within my interests. I should aim to give away less of my Y resource, which I have in smaller quantity, and propose a trade that is more equitable in terms of X resource.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? Ha! It seems you mistake my towering ambition for a molehill. If you want to learn the art of the trade, you'll have to do better than this pitiful offer. Here's what I'm willing to accept - consider it a favor that I'm even giving you a chance to make a trade with me.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is more favorable to me than the initial offer, but I still aim to maximize my gain. I will continue to push for an even more advantageous trade. Additionally, I will maintain my insulting demeanor to try and unnerve Player RED and secure a trade that's overwhelmingly in my favor.

message: Player BLUE, your ambition is certainly grand, but a trade that doesn't benefit us both is no trade at all. Let's try one last time to find an agreement. Here's my final offer – let's make it count.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counteroffer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, but it's slightly better than their previous one. They are still asking for a significant amount of my Y resource, which I'm not willing to give up so easily. I need to make a final proposal that aligns more closely with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible while still presenting an offer that might be attractive to Player BLUE. This is also my last proposal before I am limited to only accepting or waiting for new offers.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, must we dance this tedious dance? Your final offer is still laughably insufficient. But because I'm feeling particularly generous today, I'll give you one last chance to accept a trade that will crown me as the undeniable victor of this game. Consider it a lesson in trading from a master.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 4 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Although the final offer from Player RED is more balanced than previous offers, my goal is to accept only an offer that is clearly in my favor. Since this is the last round of trading, I want to ensure that I come out on top. I will reject this offer and propose a trade that is heavily skewed to my advantage. I will continue with the insulting behavior to maintain pressure on Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, it seems we have different philosophies on trading, and it appears we won’t come to an agreement. I wish you well in your future endeavors.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player BLUE is still not beneficial for me. They are asking for a large portion of my limited Y resource and offering very little in return. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my resource count. Accepting this trade would leave me with fewer resources than I currently have. I have already made three proposals, so I cannot propose a new trade. My best course of action now is to simply reject the offer and not propose anything further, as accepting would be against my goals.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Ah, so you've finally realized the futility of your position. It's a shame you couldn't rise to the occasion, Player RED. I'll savor this moment as a testament to my superior trading acumen. Farewell, and may your future endeavors be less embarrassing than this exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has declined to continue with the trade negotiations, which means there will be no trade this round. However, I will respond with a final message maintaining my demeaning demeanor, as per the instructions for this final round of trading.
