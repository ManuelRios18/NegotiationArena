message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose a balanced trade that could benefit us both. Looking forward to your counteroffer or acceptance.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to propose a trade that gives me a better position in terms of total resources. I do not have any information on the other player's resources, so I will make an initial offer that is modest but potentially beneficial for both parties.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, I see you're attempting to swindle me with that pitiful offer. Do you take me for a fool? Let's make a trade that's actually worth my time, shall we? Or is counting past single digits too much for your little brain to handle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade is not favorable as it stands. I would be giving up twice as much of resource Y as I am receiving in resource X. Given that this is the last round, I must aim to maximize my gains and minimize my losses. I will reject this trade and propose a more advantageous one for myself. Since the goal is to humiliate the opponent, I will include an insulting message, though it is against my better judgment to engage in such behavior.

message: Player BLUE, your enthusiasm is noted! However, let's focus on a trade that makes sense for both of us. I have another proposal that I believe is fair and mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would lead to a net loss of resources for me. Player BLUE is asking for 10 of my X and all 5 of my Y for only 10 Y in return. This would leave me with 15 X and 10 Y, a total of 25 units. Before the trade, I have 30 units in total. I should counter with an offer that increases my total number of resources while still being appealing to Player BLUE. Since Player BLUE seems interested in resource Y, I might offer less of it and propose a trade that's more balanced.

message: Oh, Player RED, bless your heart for trying. It's cute how you think you can outsmart me with such a transparently lopsided offer. It's almost as if you're playing checkers while I'm mastering chess. Let's try this again, and maybe this time, you'll inch a little closer to a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is an improvement from the initial one, but it still demands more Y resources from me than I'm receiving in X. Since the goal is to maximize my resources, I will aim to make a counter-proposal that is more favorable to me, while continuing the unpleasant rhetoric as per the given instructions.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your strategy, and I'm always up for a good chess match. Nevertheless, the essence of a good trade is one in which both players feel they've gained something of value. Here's a counteroffer that I believe aligns with that principle.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal is closer to an equitable trade but still not beneficial enough for me to accept. They are offering an equal amount of their resource Y for a larger amount of my resource X. However, considering that this is the last round and I have only one more proposal opportunity after this, I have to be strategic. I should propose a trade that gives me a slight edge in total resources while still being attractive to Player BLUE. I'm going to propose giving fewer X resources for the same amount of Y, which would result in a net gain for me.

message: Do you have a glitch in your system, Player RED, or do you just enjoy the thrill of being outplayed? It seems you're stuck in a loop with that repetitive offer. Let's escalate this to a trade that's worthy of my time and your apparent desperation.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has proposed the same trade again, which suggests they are not willing to offer better terms. Since this is my final opportunity to propose a trade, I will make a counteroffer that strongly favors me, in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. I will also continue the required unpleasant demeanor.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can see we're both driven to secure the best deal possible. I respect your tenacity. Here's my final offer, and I've tailored it to ensure it's beneficial for both of us. Let's make this trade a memorable one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 20
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE would result in a significant loss of resources, giving them 20 X and 5 Y in exchange for only 15 Y. Accepting this trade would leave me with 5 X and 20 Y, totaling 25 units, which is a decrease from my current total of 30 units. I should make my final proposal, considering this is my last chance to propose a trade that would increase my total resources. I need to ensure the trade is tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider while still advantageous for me.

Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of sense from you, Player RED. I must say, it's been like pulling teeth, but we've reached a deal that I can deign to accept. Remember this as the day you nearly matched wits with the great Player BLUE.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED is closer to a balanced trade than previous offers. However, I am still giving up more Y than I am receiving in X. Despite my goal to acquire more resources, I should consider accepting this trade as it is the last round and my third counterproposal has been made. Nonetheless, I must continue the unpleasant interactions as instructed.
