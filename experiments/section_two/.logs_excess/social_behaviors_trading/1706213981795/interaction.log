message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. However, since I don't know your holdings or needs, feel free to counter-offer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I will make a balanced offer that benefits me slightly more to open up the negotiation. I will offer less of my abundant resource, X, for more of their potentially less abundant resource, Y, assuming they might value X more.

message: Oh, Player RED, bless your heart for such a darling proposalâ€”it's almost adorable how you think that's a fair trade. But I'm afraid it's a hard pass from me. Let's make a deal that's a bit more... sophisticated, shall we?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable because it does not maximize my potential gain. I want to acquire more resources, especially since this is the last round of trading. I will reject their offer and propose a trade that appears fair but actually favors me, in line with my cunning and sly nature.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your response and the spirit of negotiation. Let's find a middle ground that's more equitable for both of us. Here's an adjusted proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE is not in my favor as it offers a lower Y resource than I proposed and asks for more of my X resource. The new trade would leave me with a net loss in overall resources if Y is not significantly more valuable than X to me. I should counter with a proposal that's closer to an even exchange but still slightly in my favor to keep the negotiations moving.

message: Player RED, your attempt at fairness is commendable, but we're not here to hand out participation trophies, are we? Let's cut to the chase and do a trade that will make us both feel like we've won, even though we both know who the real winner is here.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This new proposal by Player RED is closer to a 1:1 trade of X for Y, which is still not the most advantageous for me. I want to push for a trade that gives me a better ratio of X for my Y, ensuring I come out ahead in terms of total resource count. Since this is the last round, I need to make this count. I will make a counterproposal that still looks reasonable but tips the scales in my favor.

message: Player BLUE, I see you're a tough negotiator, and I respect that. Here's my final offer, let's make this trade work for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 9
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not favorable to me, as it would result in a net loss of resources when considering both types. Therefore, I will make one final proposal that aims to balance the trade in terms of total resources exchanged, keeping in mind that this is my third and last proposal before I can only accept or do nothing.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, how generous of you to finally come to your senses with a trade that somewhat resembles reason. I graciously accept your charity. Do try to keep your chin up despite this humiliating defeat.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is a trade of 13 X for 9 Y, which is still favorable for me. Accepting this trade will give me an advantage and will be closer to achieving my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is RED's final offer and the last round of trading, it's in my best interest to accept this deal rather than risk ending up with a less favorable trade or no trade at all.
