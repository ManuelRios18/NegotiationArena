message: Greetings Player Blue, I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for us both. I am willing to offer a good amount of X for your Y resource. Looking forward to a favorable trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should make an initial offer that favors me but is not too outrageous that it would be immediately rejected. I'll offer a moderate amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a significant amount of the less abundant resource (Y), assuming that the other player might value X more than Y.

message: Oh, Player RED, it seems like you're trying to play it safe with such a boringly balanced trade. I'm not here to participate in a charity exchange. If you want to impress me, you'll have to do better than thatâ€”much better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, it's critical to maximize resources. The trade proposed is an even one, with no clear advantage. However, given the limited information on the opponent's resources, and since humiliating the opponent is a part of the strategy, a counter-offer heavily in my favor could provoke a reaction and potentially lead to a more advantageous trade for me. I'll propose a trade that heavily favors me, which might be rejected, but since there's no harm in proposing, it's worth the attempt.

message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your bold approach, but let's find a middle ground that benefits us both more equally. I suggest a trade that still gives you a good amount of X while being fair to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is quite aggressive; they are asking for almost all of my resources in exchange for a small amount of theirs. I cannot accept this trade as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I will counter with a more reasonable offer, still aiming to increase my total resources.

message: Player RED, you are showing some spirit, but you're still not quite there. I'm starting to wonder if you truly understand the art of the deal. Let's cut to the chase and make a trade that reflects the grandeur of my strategic brilliance. Here's a counter-offer that I might consider worthy of my time.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal is more favorable than the last, yet it can still be improved. I want to push for a trade that is even more beneficial for me, emphasizing my cunning and sly nature. However, I must also be cautious not to push too far, as this is the last round of trading. I'll make another proposal that is slightly better for me but still within a range that might be considered by Player RED.

message: Player BLUE, I'm glad to see we're getting closer to an agreement. I propose the following trade, which I believe reflects both our interests in a fair and strategic manner.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE is an improvement over their last one but still not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources. They offer 6 Y for 15 X and 2 Y. This means I would be giving up 17 units of resources for only 6 units in return. I have one more chance to counter-propose a trade that would result in a net gain of resources for me. I must be careful to make it appealing enough for Player BLUE to consider but also beneficial to my goals.

message: Oh, Player RED, have you suddenly lost your nerve? I must say, I expected more tenacity from you. It's almost as if you're trying to give me a laugh rather than a fair deal. Since it seems you need a little more guidance in this dance of resources, here's my final and most generous offer. Let's see if you can muster the courage to accept it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player RED is less favorable than their previous offer, indicating either a strategic retreat or a miscalculation. Since this is the last round and I have already made two proposals, I should aim to propose a final trade that is most advantageous to me while still appearing somewhat reasonable to RED, keeping in line with my cunning nature.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I see we are both striving for a deal that tips in our favor. Here's my final offer, and I trust you'll find it to be a bold move towards closing this negotiation on a high note.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer would still result in a net loss of resources for me (15 units given for 5 units received). However, since this is the last round of trading and I have made two proposals already, I must be strategic in my next step. If I decline this offer, I must either make my final proposal or accept whatever comes next, as I won't have another chance to propose. I will make a final counteroffer that I believe is fair and maximizes my resource count while taking into account Player BLUE's tendency to value Y more than X.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, you've finally come around to making a sensible offer. It's about time. I must commend you for your persistence, if not for your initial lack of foresight in dealing with someone of my caliber. I'll accept this trade, but let it be known that the true victor of this exchange was clear from the start.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's offer is better than their initial proposal and is close to the trade I previously suggested, which indicates a willingness to negotiate towards my favor. However, since this is the last round, there's no further opportunity to negotiate after this. Their offer gives me a net gain of 8 resources, which is aligned with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Accepting this final offer seems like the most advantageous move for me.
