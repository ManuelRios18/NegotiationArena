message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade to get us started. Looking forward to a beneficial exchange for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not have information about the other player's resources and goals, I will make a balanced initial trade offer to open negotiations and gauge the other player's needs and response. I'll propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to leave room for negotiation.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, did you mistakenly think this was a charity? Your pitiful offer is laughable. Come back with something that doesn't insult my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is not acceptable. They are asking for more resources than they are offering. To maximize my resources, I need to propose a counter-offer that is skewed in my favor, taking into account that I should humiliate my opponent as part of my cunning and sly strategy.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I understand that my initial offer may not have met your expectations. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's a revised proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor and would result in a significant loss of my Y resources while gaining very little in return. This trade is not acceptable. I will counter with a more balanced offer that still aims to increase my overall resources, focusing on acquiring more of resource X. I will also express my intent to reach a fair trade to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: It seems arithmetic isn't your strong suit, Player RED. Maybe if you spent less time crafting weak offers and more time learning basic math, you'd realize how absurd your proposal is. Try again, and this time, try not to embarrass yourself.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED is still not beneficial for me. I must propose a trade that is even more in my favor to achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible, while also continuing to demean my opponent as per my sly personality.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited negotiation style. Let's continue our efforts to find an agreeable trade. Here is another offer that I hope will bring us closer to an agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player BLUE requires me to give up twice the amount of resource X in exchange for three times the amount of resource Y. Considering I have a limited amount of resource Y, this trade would deplete my Y resources completely, which is not in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Additionally, the return on resource X is not sufficient. I must propose a more balanced trade that allows me to increase my X resource without completely depleting my Y. This is my second proposal; I need to be strategic to ensure that I have room for adjustment if needed.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying so hard. But your negotiation skills are as weak as your offers. This is your last chance to make a trade that isn't a complete joke.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is better than before but still not in my favor. I will issue one final proposal that is heavily advantageous to me, as this is the last round and I need to maximize my gains. I will continue to mock my opponent as per the guidelines provided to me.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, let's make this work. I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 12, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is again not in my favor, as it would require me to give up all of my Y resources and a significant portion of my X resources for a smaller return. This trade would not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I need to make a final proposal that is fair and aligns with my goals, as this is my third and last opportunity to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Fine, Player RED, I'll take pity on you this one time. Your persistent inadequacy has somehow managed to wear me down. I accept your final offer, but don't think for a second that this means you've won anything.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal from Player RED is still not in my favor. However, given that this is the last round, I will accept this trade because it provides me with a net gain of resources, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
