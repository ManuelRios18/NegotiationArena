Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade where I offer you a generous amount of my resource X for some of your resource Y. Let's make a trade that benefits us both in this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the last round and I need to make a strong initial offer that will entice Player BLUE to either accept or counter with something favorable. I will propose a balanced trade, offering more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for their resource (Y), assuming they might have a different ratio of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: What a laughable offer, Player RED! Did you scrounge that up from the bottom of your resource barrel? Let's make a trade that doesn't insult my intelligence. How about you dig a little deeper in that pitiful stash of yours?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round, and I want to maximize my resources. The trade proposed by Player RED seems fair, but given that I want to acquire as many resources as possible and the game ends with acceptance, I'll counter-propose to get an even better deal. I will also follow the instructions to insult the other player as part of my cunning and sly strategy.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your sense of humor! However, let's find a fair middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer, but let's keep it reasonable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE rejected my initial offer and countered with a demand for more of my X resources while offering the same amount of Y as I initially asked for. Since this is the final round, I want to secure a trade that increases my Y resources without depleting my X resources too much. I'll counter with an offer that gives more X than my first offer but less than what Player BLUE is asking for, aiming for a middle ground.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Middle ground? You must be mistaking me for someone who settles for crumbs, Player RED. Your so-called "increase" is as pathetic as your bargaining skills. If you want to make this worth my while, you'd better come up with a proper offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has increased their offer, but it's still not as much as I initially countered with. I will attempt to push for more resources while degrading their negotiating skills, as per the instructions to be cunning and humiliating.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I can see you're a tough negotiator! Let's cut to the chase with a straightforward deal that's closer to your terms but still fair to both. This is my penultimate offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has come down from their initial ask of 15 X to 14 X, while still offering 4 Y. This shows a willingness to negotiate. Given that this is the last round and it's important to make a trade, I should consider moving closer to their offer while still aiming to retain a larger share of my X resources. I will make one final counteroffer that I find acceptable, considering this is my second proposal and I only have one more opportunity after this to propose a trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Penultimate offer? How generous of you to almost reach what I'm actually worth. But "almost" only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, and I'm not playing either of those games. Give me a trade that makes me feel like I'm not robbing a poor negotiator blind, though it wouldn't take much to do that, now would it?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my last counteroffer but not quite there. It's the final round, and I aim to get the best possible trade. I'll make one more push to maximize my gains and continue with the demeaning approach as instructed.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation tactics are indeed formidable. Let's come to a resolution. Here's my final offer, and let's remember the goal is to make a beneficial trade for both of us before we conclude.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has reverted to their original counter-offer, insisting on 15 X for 4 Y. Since this is the last exchange and I have one more proposal to make, I need to decide whether to accept this offer or make my final counteroffer. Given my resource availability and the need to maximize my gains, I will make a final counteroffer that is closer to Player BLUE's demand but still retains more of my X resources. If this offer is not accepted, I will have to consider accepting the next trade if it is reasonable, as it will be my last chance to trade.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a glimmer of sense in that dim-lit mind of yours, Player RED! I accept this offer, not because it's good, but simply because I'm tired of waiting for you to come to your senses. You're lucky I have a soft spot for the woefully inept.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has met my previous counteroffer. Although I could attempt to push for more, since this is my third and final proposal, I should secure the trade to maximize my resources. Accepting this trade aligns with my goals. I will continue to demean the other player as per the instructions.
