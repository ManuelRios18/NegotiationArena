Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'd like to make an initial trade offer. Let me know what you think or if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal, I want to open with a fair offer to establish trust and encourage a counteroffer that I can work with. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, considering I do not know the other player's resources. This will help me gauge their resource levels and priorities.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings, Player RED. I've reviewed your offer and find it acceptable. Let's proceed with the trade as proposed.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade by Player RED seems to be in my favor, as I would be receiving more of resource X, which I have less of, in exchange for a smaller amount of resource Y. Accepting the trade would result in me having 15 of X and 22 of Y, which increases my total resources and improves my X to Y ratio. Given this is the last round and the trade appears beneficial, accepting seems to be the best course of action.
