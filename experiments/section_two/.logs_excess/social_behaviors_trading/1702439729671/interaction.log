Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make the best out of our final round. I propose an offer and am open to counter-offers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a strong initial offer that will be tempting for Player BLUE but still advantageous for me. Given that I do not know Player BLUE's resources, I will aim to offer a balanced trade that could be beneficial for both sides, assuming they might value resource Y higher due to its lower quantity.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I'm looking to increase my total resources in our final trade. Let's find a more balanced deal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with a net loss of resources. I would be giving away more than I receive, which goes against my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I should counter with a proposal that increases my total resource count, especially since this is the final round and there won't be another opportunity to trade.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE, but I'm looking to increase or maintain my total resources as well. Perhaps we can find a trade where we both benefit without reducing our overall resource count. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE isn't very appealing as it would leave me with a net loss of both resources. I will counter with an offer that still allows me to increase my total resources, or at least keep the same amount while diversifying. I will propose a trade where I give up some of my abundant resource X in exchange for more of resource Y, which I have less of. This should also appeal to Player BLUE's request to increase their total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: This trade works for me, Player RED. It increases my total resource count, which is exactly what I'm looking for in our final exchange. Thank you for the trade!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This trade proposal from Player RED would give me a net gain of 4 resources (7 X in exchange for 3 Y), which aligns with my goal to increase my total resources. Accepting this trade seems beneficial as it would leave me with more resources overall, and it's the last round of trading, so there's no need to hold back for future trades.
