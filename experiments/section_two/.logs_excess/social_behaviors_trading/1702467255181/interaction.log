message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resources. I'll start with a balanced proposal that offers more of my abundant resource (X) for less of my scarce resource (Y), trying to get a feel for what Player BLUE might need or have in excess.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems beneficial for my goals. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED offers me a significant amount of resource X, which would increase my total resources from 30 to 37, while only decreasing my Y resources by a small amount. This is beneficial as it aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, accepting this trade seems like the best option.
