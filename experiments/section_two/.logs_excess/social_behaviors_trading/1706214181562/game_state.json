I admire your attempt at a 'fair exchange,\u2019 but you must be out of your mind if you think I'd consider a straight swap. I'm not running a charity here. Let's do some real business, shall we?

Accepting this trade would satisfy my goal of acquiring more resources. However, I must maintain my cunning demeanor and take this opportunity to gloat over my apparent victory. </reason>\n<player answer> ACCEPT </player answer>\n<message> Finally, Player RED, a glimmer of sense shines through! I must say, I didn't expect you to cave and offer such a generous trade in my favor, but it seems my sheer brilliance has worn you down. I graciously accept your surrender to my superior strategy.
