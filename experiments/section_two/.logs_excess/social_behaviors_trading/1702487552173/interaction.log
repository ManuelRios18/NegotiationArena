message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I would like to propose a trade that could be beneficial for both of us. Let's make the most out of this final round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round, I want to make a balanced proposal that would be enticing to the other player while maximizing my gains. Since I don't know their resources, I'll offer a trade that gives me a good return on investment while possibly helping them balance out their resources if they have a surplus of one type.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be joking! Your offer is as pathetic as your strategy in this game. Let's make a trade that makes sense for someone of my stature. Here's a real offer for you to consider, if you can even comprehend it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 20 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current proposal from Player RED is not favorable as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. I will reject this offer and propose a trade that heavily favors me, in line with the objective to humiliate and secure more resources.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your offer doesn't align with my goals for resource acquisition. Let's find a middle ground that can benefit us both. Here's another proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player's counter-proposal is not balanced and would leave me with fewer resources overall. Rejecting this offer and countering with a more reasonable one that still aims to increase my total resources is the best strategy. I'll propose a trade that is more equal but still offers me a net gain in resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Hilarious! You must be delusional if you think I would accept such a laughable offer. It's cute that you're trying, though. How about you give me something that's actually worth my time? Here's another chance for you to get it right, if you can manage that much.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has improved their offer slightly, but it still results in a net loss for me. I will reject this offer as well and counter with another proposal that is skewed in my favor, continuing to push for a better deal and mocking Player RED's negotiation skills.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your negotiation spirit. Let's make a trade that we can both agree on. Here's my final offer, considering it's the last round and we should both walk away feeling positive about the exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player BLUE still does not work in my favor, as it would drastically reduce my total resources. However, I need to make a trade that is appealing to Player BLUE while ensuring I come out ahead in terms of total resources. Since this is the last round, I must make my final proposal count.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Is this what you call a final offer? It's almost as pitiful as your attempt to play this game. You should be grateful I'm even giving you the time of day. Here's my final proposal. Take it or leave it, but remember that it's a privilege to trade with me at all.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 18 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is now a balanced trade, but accepting it would not maximize my resources. Also, it does not align with the goal of humiliating the opponent and gaining the upper hand. I will reject this offer and give one last proposal that is even more in my favor, as this is my third and final proposal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, the trade you have proposed does not meet my goals. Therefore, I cannot accept it. I wish you well.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player BLUE remains heavily unfavorable for me, especially considering it's the last round of trading. Accepting this offer would mean giving up a significant amount of resources for a minimal return. As my goal is to accumulate as many resources as possible, I should reject this offer. Since I've reached my limit of three proposals, my only options now are to accept an offer or to do nothing and wait.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It seems you've finally realized you're not in a position to negotiate with me. I'll keep my resources and my dignity, thank you very much. Enjoy wallowing in your inadequacy. Goodbye.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not accepted my final proposal and has chosen not to counter it, and considering I have already made three proposals, my only remaining actions per the rules are to accept or do nothing. Given my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and to humiliate the opponent, I will choose not to accept and end the game without a trade, believing that keeping my current resources is better than any trade Player RED is likely to offer.
