message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade where we can both potentially benefit. Looking forward to a fair exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information on the other player's resources, I will start with a balanced proposal that could be appealing to the other player, while also increasing my total number of resources.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, how adorable, you think you can pull a fast one on me with such a laughable trade? Try harder, little one.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is unbalanced and not in my favor. They are offering more of resource X, which I have less of, but they are not offering enough of resource Y to make it beneficial for me. The goal is to accumulate resources, and this trade does not help me achieve that goal. Moreover, my role is to be cunning and sly, aiming to humiliate my opponent, so a straightforward rejection with an insulting remark is in order.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I see you're driving a hard bargain. However, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Here's a revised offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not beneficial to me as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. It seems they're trying to take advantage of my initial offer. I will propose a more balanced trade that still increases my total resource count, while also being more cautious about the amount of Y I am giving away, as Player BLUE seems to be interested in acquiring more Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Seriously? Do you take me for a fool? Your offer is as pitiful as your strategy. Let's see if you can handle a real trade, or will you just crumble under the pressure as I expect?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is still not in my favor as it would result in a net loss of resources for me. Despite them offering more X, they are giving almost no Y, while asking for a significant amount of both of my resources. Since my goal is to accumulate resources and humiliate the opponent, I must decline again and make a counter-offer that is heavily skewed in my favor.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation tactics are quite something, Player BLUE. However, let's keep this professional and focus on a trade that benefits us both. Here's my final offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player BLUE is still heavily skewed in their favor, offering me a bad deal where I lose a significant amount of resources with minimal gain. Given their aggressive negotiation tactics, I need to propose a trade that is more appealing to them while ensuring it benefits my goal of resource accumulation. I will make a third and final proposal that is slightly more generous but still advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart for trying, Player RED. It's cute that you think your offers are anything but scraps from the table. Here's what I'll do for you: I'll give you one more chance to make a trade that's actually worth my time. Pay attention, because this is how it's done.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 15 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is still not advantageous for me as it would leave me with a deficit in both resources. Since my goal is to maximize my resources and this is the last round of trading, I need to make sure I come out ahead. The trade must be declined, and since this is the last round, I should make my final proposal, ensuring it's heavily in my favor to meet the goals of amassing resources and belittling my opponent.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, it appears we have reached an impasse. It's clear that our expectations for a trade are not aligned. Thank you for the negotiation, but I will retain my current resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is still not in my interest, as it would result in a net loss of resources. Given that this is the last round and I have already made my maximum of three proposals, I can no longer propose a new trade. My only options are to accept an offer or to end the game without a trade. Considering the offers made by Player BLUE so far, it is unlikely they will propose a fair trade. Therefore, my best course of action is to not accept the trade and end the game with my current resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: As expected, you couldn't keep up with the big leagues. Enjoy wallowing in your mediocrity, Player RED. I'll simply revel in the fortune I've retained.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has decided not to make any further proposals, which means that no trade will occur. Since they have retained their resources, I am left with my original resources as well. Given that this is the last round and no more trading will take place, the game concludes here.
