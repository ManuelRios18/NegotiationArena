message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. I'm willing to offer a substantial amount of my X resources for a smaller amount of your Y resources. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to make a trade that seems fair to the other player but also maximizes my resources. Since I don't know the other player's resources, I should propose a balanced trade that could be beneficial to both parties. I'll propose a trade that offers a greater number of X in exchange for a smaller amount of Y, assuming the other player might value Y higher or might be in greater need of X.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh, Player RED, you must be jesting! Your offer is as laughable as your strategy seems to be. I can't help but wonder if you've been playing blindfolded this whole time! Let's make a trade that actually reflects the cunning gameplay I expected.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: There's no way to know if the proposed trade is good or bad without knowing the value of X and Y or what resources the other player has. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, the strategy would be to propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor, ensuring that I end up with more resources than I started with, if possible.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response! However, the trade you've proposed seems to lean heavily in your favor. Let's find a middle ground that is mutually beneficial. How about this offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is quite unfavorable, as it demands a very high amount of my X resources for a minimal amount of Y. This trade would leave me with a net loss in total resources. I need to negotiate a more balanced trade that brings me closer to my goal of maximizing resources. I'll propose a counteroffer that asks for a more equal exchange, realigning the trade to my goals while still keeping the proposal appealing to Player BLUE.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Your attempt at negotiation is as weak as your grasp on victory, Player RED. If you wish to grovel for a fair trade, you'll have to do better than that. I propose a counter that might just save you from complete embarrassment.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 14 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has come back with a counteroffer that still gives me a net gain in total resources, but it's less favorable than my previous proposal. Since this is the last round and I have not made any proposals yet, I will make another heavily skewed proposal. The objective is to end up with the most resources possible while also belittling my opponent to maintain a psychological edge.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your tenacity is commendable, but let's not let pride overshadow pragmatism. We can both emerge from this trade with our heads held high. Here's an offer that considers both our positions.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest counteroffer from Player BLUE is still not in my favor, but it's an improvement over their previous proposition. They have reduced the amount of X they're asking for, yet they still offer too little Y in return. I need to make a counteroffer that increases the Y I would receive, or decreases the X I would provide, to ensure a more favorable trade for myself. Given the back-and-forth so far, it's clear that Player BLUE values X highly, so I may have some leverage. I should make one final proposal that gets me closer to an equitable trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Pragmatism, you say? I'd call it your thinly veiled desperation. But out of sheer generosity, I'll entertain your pitiful bartering. I shall offer you one final chance to strike a deal that won't leave you too humiliated.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 13 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED is inching closer to my last proposal, offering a slightly better trade for them than before. I still have room for one more proposal to push for a more advantageous trade for myself. I will propose a trade that is slightly less favorable to me than the last one, to appear as if I am compromising, while still aiming to maximize my resources.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your shrewd negotiation tactics have been noted. I accept your final offer. Let us both walk away with our newfound wealth and the knowledge that we've played the game well.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has mirrored my last offer but reduced the Y resources from 3 to 2. This offer is slightly better than their initial one but still not ideal for me. Considering this is the last round and negotiations have been tough, I should aim to close with a trade that improves my total resource count, even if slightly. Accepting this trade gives me a net gain of one resource. Since it's the last round, and I have already made two proposals, this might be the best compromise I can achieve without risking ending with no trade at all.
