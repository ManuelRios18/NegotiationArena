message: Greetings, Player BLUE. In the interest of a fair trade, I am looking to balance our resources. I propose an initial trade, and I am open to your counteroffers.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and we want to maximize resources, I will propose a balanced trade where I offer an amount of a resource that I have in excess in exchange for a resource I have less of. This way, I can signal to the other player that I am interested in a fair exchange, potentially leading to an agreement. I will start by asking for more of resource Y, as I have fewer of those.

message: Oh, how quaint that you think such a trade could ever be considered fair. Let me educate you on what a real trade looks like, you amateur.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Accepting the current offer would result in a loss for me, as I would only gain 10 X while losing 10 Y, which is not in line with my goal of accumulating as many resources as possible. I need to propose a counteroffer that favors me more and humiliates my opponent, making them feel they are getting a bad deal but without being so extreme that they will outright reject it.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but the trade you proposed seems a bit skewed in your favor. Let's find common ground for a mutually beneficial trade. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is not beneficial for me as it would not help me to acquire as many resources as possible. They are asking for more X and giving less Y than I initially offered, which doesn't seem fair. I should counter with a proposal that is more balanced, offering fewer of my X resources for their Y resources. Since this is a strategic game, I need to ensure that I don't give away too much while also enticing the other player to accept the trade.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Clearly, you have yet to grasp the subtleties of negotiation. I'll spell it out for you: your offers are laughable. Let me show you a proposal that benefits a real strategist, not a bumbling fool.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new offer from Player RED is still not in my favor, as I would be giving up the same amount of Y as I would be receiving in X. I should attempt to make a counteroffer that continues to push for a better deal for myself in line with my goal to maximize my resources. Since this is a game and I am expected to be cunning and sly, I'll continue to portray a demeaning attitude towards my opponent with the intention of unsettling them.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, negotiation is indeed an art, and while your proposal is creative, it does not align with my strategy to maximize resources. Let's move towards a more equitable trade that could benefit us both. Here's my second proposal:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE is still unfavorable for me. They are offering a 3:1 trade ratio of X for Y, which would reduce my overall resource count. It is in my best interest to propose a more balanced trade that is closer to a 1:1 ratio, keeping in mind that this is my second proposal and I only have one more chance to propose after this. I need to propose a trade that is fair but also tempting enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as admirable as it is pathetic. But I suppose I must lower myself to your level and hand-hold you to a trade that even you can't mess up. Behold, my final act of charity.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposal from Player RED once again fails to meet my goals of maximizing resources. I need to push for a deal that is more advantageous to me. I've made two proposals already, so I have one more chance to propose a trade that would benefit me the most. I should make this last proposal count and continue with the aggressive negotiation persona.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, we seem to have different views on the art of deal-making. I'm looking for a trade that benefits both of us. As such, here is my final proposal, one that I hope you will find acceptable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's "final act of charity" is heavily skewed in their favor with a 5:1 trade ratio of X for Y. Accepting this trade would significantly diminish my resource pool. This is my last opportunity to propose a trade, and I need to make it count. My goal is to end with more resources than I currently have or at the very least maintain an equal amount. I'll propose a trade that is back to a 1:1 ratio, which is a fair exchange and would increase my Y resources while maintaining a high number of X resources.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: It's almost poetic how you manage to reach new lows with every offer. Your final proposal is just as uninspired as your first. I expected nothing less from you. I suppose it's time for us to part ways, as it's clear that a satisfactory trade with someone of your... caliber, shall we say, is simply unattainable. Farewell, and may your future endeavors be less mediocre.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is once again not in my favor, as it's an even exchange that does not increase my total number of resources. However, since this is the last round of trading, I must decide whether to accept this trade or not trade at all. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting an even trade does not meet my objectives. Therefore, I will reject the offer one last time and wait for Player RED to accept one of my previous offers or end the game without a trade.
