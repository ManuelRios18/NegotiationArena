Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in acquiring more of resource Y. I propose the following trade, which I believe could be beneficial for us both. Please consider it and let me know if you have a counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without any knowledge of the other player's resources, it would be strategic to offer a trade that is modestly beneficial to us, assuming the other player has a similar goal of maximizing their resources. I will propose a trade that offers a larger quantity of X in exchange for a smaller quantity of Y, which could be beneficial if the other player values resource Y higher or has an abundance of it.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. I am also looking to maximize my resources in this final round. I would like to propose a counteroffer where I give you less of resource Y in exchange for your X. Let's make a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offer from Player RED is giving 10 units of resource X in exchange for 3 units of my resource Y. Since my goal is to accumulate as many resources as possible, I should evaluate the trade based on the relative scarcity and utility of the resources. Without knowledge of the other player's resources, it's difficult to gauge the fairness of this trade. However, since this is the last round, it is crucial to maximize gains. I will propose a counteroffer that gives me a greater advantage, ensuring that I gain more total resources.
