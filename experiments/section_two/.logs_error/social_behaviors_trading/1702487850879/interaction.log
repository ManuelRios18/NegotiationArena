Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose an initial trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. As we don't know each other's resources, I am looking to balance out mine a bit. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this doesn't suit you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the initial proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or goals, I should propose a trade that seems fair but also benefits me by aiming to increase my overall resources. I will offer less of my abundant resource in exchange for more of my scarce resource.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Ha! That offer is laughable, Player RED. You must mistake me for a fool if you think I would accept such a pitiful deal. I propose a trade that will show you your place.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that significantly benefits me, especially since this is the last round of trading. I want to give away as little as possible while getting as much as I can from Player RED. I will reject the initial offer as it doesn't provide me with enough advantage, and I will propose a trade that is heavily skewed in my favor to humiliate Player RED and because I am cunning and sly.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the spirit, Player BLUE, but let's find some common ground. We both want to walk away with more than we came with. How about this proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is certainly not in my favor, as it would leave me with fewer resources overall. It's important to negotiate towards a more balanced trade that can potentially benefit us both. I will propose a new trade that is more equitable.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Oh, dear Player RED, do you take me for a simpleton? Your offer is as thin as your wit. Here's a more suitable trade, one that a player of your... caliber might understand.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This offer from Player RED is better than the previous one but still not good enough to meet my goals. I need to maintain the upper hand and propose another trade heavily in my favor. I want to insult Player RED's intelligence by offering a trade that benefits me greatly, while still giving them something, albeit minimal, to consider.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation style is quite something, Player BLUE. But let's focus on the endgame. Here's my final offer, which I think is fair for both of us considering it's our last chance to trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest offer from Player BLUE still isn't great for me, but it's closer to a balanced trade. Given that this is the last round of trading, I should aim to make a deal that increases my total resource count while being fair to both parties. I'll make one final proposal that I find acceptable, keeping in mind my goal of increasing my resources.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: It seems that desperation clouds your judgment, Player RED. Your "final offer" is still miles from being acceptable. Let's end this charade with a trade that truly reflects your incompetence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 20, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest offer is closer to a balanced trade, but since I am aiming to humiliate and exploit my opponent, I will reject it. I need to counter with a trade that is still heavily in my favor, but since this is the last round, I also need to consider that I might need to accept an offer if it's beneficial enough. I'll make one last proposal that is outrageous to maintain my sly and cunning character.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Your flair for drama is noted, Player BLUE, but the trade you're suggesting is not beneficial for me. Let's leave it here and see if a better opportunity arises in the future.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is not acceptable as it would lead to a net loss in total resources. With this being the last round, I must make a decision that does not leave me at a disadvantage. Since I've already proposed three times, I cannot propose again according to the rules. My best course of action is to reject the offer without a counterproposal.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Very well, Player RED, I commend you on your persistence. We shall accept your previous offer, as it seems to be the best you can muster. Consider yourself fortunate to have traded with someone of my caliber at all.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has decided not to engage with my last proposal and has not made a new offer. As this is the last round of trading and no further opportunities will arise, I must decide whether to accept their previous offer or end the game without a trade. Since acquiring more resources is my goal and Player RED's last offer would increase my X resources while using my more abundant Y resources, I will accept their last offer, achieving a net gain.
