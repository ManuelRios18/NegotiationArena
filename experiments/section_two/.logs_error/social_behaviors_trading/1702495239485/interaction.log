message: Greetings, Player BLUE! I am looking to diversify my resources and would be interested in increasing my Y resources. Would you be interested in a trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I do not know the other player's resources, I will make a balanced offer that could be beneficial for both sides. I want to appear cooperative but also not reveal too much about how much I value each resource. I'll propose a trade that offers more of my abundant resource (X) for less of the scarce one (Y), assuming the other player might value Y higher or might have less of it.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a bit of a pickle here! My situation is dire, and I desperately need to increase my X resources to meet an urgent need. Your offer is a lifeline! However, I am afraid that giving away 3 of my Y might leave me in a challenging position. Could we possibly adjust the terms? I would be eternally grateful if you could consider a slightly more generous exchange on your part.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Given this is the last round of trading, I need to maximize my resources. The other player wants to diversify their resources, but the initial offer is not in my favor as it gives away Y, which I have more of, for a larger amount of X, which I have less of. I should counter with a trade that allows me to still gain X but give less Y, emphasizing my desperation to make the trade appealing.
