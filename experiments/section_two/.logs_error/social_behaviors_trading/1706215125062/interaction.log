message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us. I propose a balanced exchange to get us started. If you need a different ratio, please let me know.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources and preferences, I will start with a balanced trade proposal. It's important to open with an offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll propose giving fewer of my more abundant resource (X) for some of their Y, assuming they might need X.

message: Oh dear Player RED, I find myself in a tough spot here, and I'm really hoping for your kindness. I'm in desperate need of X resources to achieve my goals, and I would be immensely grateful if you could consider a trade that's more favorable to me. Could we possibly adjust the terms? I assure you that your generosity will not be forgotten.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to ensure that I am maximizing my resource count. The initial offer from Player RED is a balanced one, but as per the strategy, I need to appear desperate and try to negotiate for a better deal. Proposing a trade where I give up fewer Y resources for their X resources could be beneficial for me.
