message: Greetings, Player BLUE. As we engage in this final round of trading, I am interested in making a deal that is beneficial for both of us. I propose an initial trade where I offer some of my resource X in exchange for your resource Y, assuming you might value X more. Please feel free to make a counteroffer if this doesn't meet your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I do not know the other player's resources, I need to make a balanced initial offer that is likely to be appealing to the other player while also advancing my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will start by offering a trade that could be beneficial for both sides, assuming the other player might value one resource more than the other.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am interested in acquiring more of resource X as well. However, I would like to counter with a slightly different trade to better balance our exchange.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I need to make a decision that maximizes my resources. I have no information on Player RED's resources, so I will make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, giving away less of my abundant resource Y in exchange for their X.
