message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for us both. I'm willing to offer a good amount of my X resources for your Y resources. Looking forward to a mutually beneficial trade!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that appears fair and beneficial to both sides without knowing Player BLUE's resources or goals. I would aim to trade more of my abundant resource (X) for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming they might have a similar but opposite distribution. This way, I can increase my overall resource count.
