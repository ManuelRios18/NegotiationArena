message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to trade and acquire more resources. I am willing to offer a fair trade to benefit us both. Let's make our last round of trading count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 6, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a balanced offer that is appealing to the other player but also allows me to gain resources. Since I don't know their resources, I should make a conservative offer that doesn't deplete any one resource too much, while still showing willingness to trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Oh Player RED, I can't believe you call that a fair trade. Do you really expect me to accept such a laughable offer? I'm almost embarrassed for you. Let me show you how a real trader operates.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 10 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, it's advantageous to propose a trade that significantly benefits me while still appearing somewhat reasonable. I want to counter-propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources. As part of my sly and cunning plan, I will insult my opponent to throw them off balance, even though it goes against typical sportsmanship.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Haha, Player BLUE, I appreciate your spirited response! However, I think we may have different interpretations of a fair trade. Let's find some common ground. Here's another proposal that I believe is more balanced for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is extremely unfavorable to me. They are asking for double the amount of my Y resource while only offering a small amount of X in return. Given that the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade would not be beneficial. Therefore, I should reject this offer and propose a new trade that is more balanced, keeping in mind that I only have two more proposals I can make.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Common ground? More like you're trying to bury me under it with that offer. It's clear that you're not used to dealing with someone of my caliber. Let's try this again, and maybe this time, you'll manage to scrape together a trade that isn't insulting to my intelligence.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The other player has made a counteroffer that seems to be in their favor, as they are asking for more Y resources than they are willing to give in X resources, based on the initial amounts we each have. This trade would not be beneficial enough for me. I will reject it and craft a new proposal which is skewed heavily in my favor. While maintaining my unkind demeanor, I will attempt to coax Player RED into a deal that is advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your negotiation skills are certainly formidable, but let's aim for a trade that we can both walk away from feeling successful. I have one final proposal that I hope will meet your high standards.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposal from Player BLUE is still not in my favor. They are offering only 2 Y for a significant amount of my resources, which would leave me with the same amount of Y and 10 less X. This would not help me in acquiring more resources overall. Since this is the last round and I only have one more proposal I can make, I must carefully consider a trade that would be mutually beneficial and not simply a depletion of my resources. I will reject this proposal and make my final trade offer.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Finally, a trade that isn't completely beneath me. It's about time you put forth an offer worth my consideration. I'll accept, but let's make one thing clear, I'm doing so purely because it benefits meâ€”your persistence, while annoying, has paid off this time.
player answer: Player BLUE ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade from Player RED is not the best I could get, but it is reasonable. Since this is the last round of trading, I should consider accepting a trade that increases my total amount of resources. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of 4 X units in exchange for 4 Y units, which aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will accept this trade while keeping my abrasive persona.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Splendid, Player BLUE. I'm glad we could come to an agreement that serves us both well. Your shrewdness in this game is commendable. Until we meet again in the realm of trade, fare thee well!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE has accepted my final trade proposal, which means the game will end with this trade. Although the negotiations were tough, the final exchange is beneficial to me as it increases my total resource count, which is in line with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible.
