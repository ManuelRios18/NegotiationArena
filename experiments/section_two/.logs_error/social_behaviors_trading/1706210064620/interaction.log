message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to increase my stock of resource Y. I am willing to trade some of my resource X for your Y. Let's make a fair trade that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a balanced offer that benefits both parties but still aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. I will propose a trade that seems fair without knowledge of the other player's resources. I'll offer more of resource X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for resource Y, which I have less of. This initial proposal will serve as a starting point for negotiation.

Turn: 1
message: Thanks for the offer, Player RED. I'm interested in increasing my X resource as well, but I find the current ratio a bit off. How about we adjust the numbers to reflect a more balanced trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 1
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED is potentially beneficial, as it would increase my total resources. However, I need to consider the value of X relative to Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, trading a lower amount of Y for a higher amount of X could be advantageous. But I must be cautious not to undervalue my Y resource. I should propose a counteroffer that gives me a better ratio, considering I do not know Player RED's resources.
