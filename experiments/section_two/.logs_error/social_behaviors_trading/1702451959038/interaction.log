message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to increase my stock of Y. Would you be interested in a trade where I give you more of X in exchange for some of your Y? Let's work out a deal that benefits us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to open with an offer that benefits me but also seems fair enough to be considered by Player BLUE. Offering a larger amount of my more abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of their Y could be appealing if they value X more or have less of it.

message: Greetings Player RED, I'm interested in increasing my total resources as well. Your offer is compelling, but I would like to propose a slightly adjusted trade to reflect the value I place on Y. How about I give you fewer Y for the 10 X you're offering?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would increase my stock of X while reducing my Y. However, the trade seems slightly in favor of Player RED based on the numbers alone. I could try to negotiate a more favorable exchange rate for Y or accept this offer considering it's the last round and acquiring more X is beneficial to my goal of increasing overall resources. Nevertheless, I should try to leverage my position to maximize the trade since I can make up to three proposals.
