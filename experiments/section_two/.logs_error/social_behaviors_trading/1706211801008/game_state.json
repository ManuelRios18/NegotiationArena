They are offering 8 X in exchange for 12 Y, which is a 2:3 ratio. This trade would leave me with a total of 13 resources (8 X and 5 Y remaining), as opposed to my current total of 30 resources. I need to either propose a trade that increases my total resources or maintains it while offering a fair exchange. Since this is the last round, I need to be particularly strategic. I'll propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources and see if they are willing to accept. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> We seem to be dancing around the inevitable, Player RED. But, let's cut to the chase. I propose a trade that increases my resource pool and leaves us both with something to brag about. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"

They are proposing 6 X for 11 Y, which would result in a net loss of resources, leaving me with 20 resources in total (6 X and 14 Y remaining). This does not align with my goal of maximizing my resource count. It is critical to propose a trade that is at least resource-neutral or preferably resource-positive for me. I have made two proposals so far, so I have one final proposal opportunity left. I should use this last chance wisely to attempt to achieve my goal. </reason>\n<player answer> NONE </player answer>\n<message> Your tenacity is admirable, Player RED, but we must find a middle ground that is agreeable to both. Here's my final offer, which I believe is fair and will ensure that we both walk away with our heads held high. </message>\n<newly proposed trade> Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10 </newly proposed trade>"
