message: Oh, Player Blue, I can’t believe you’ve lasted this long with such a lackluster performance. I almost feel bad taking more from you, but that’s the game! Shall we make our last exchange memorable? How about you give me something substantial so you can at least say you put up a good fight in the end?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I need to maximize my resources, I will start with a trade that is clearly in my favor, hoping the opponent will make a counteroffer that is still beneficial to me. As the goal states, I must also include humiliating content to belittle my opponent, although this is not a practice I endorse.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Nice try, Player RED, but I think we can do better. I'm looking for a trade that's a bit more balanced. How about an even trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is not favorable for me since it doesn’t give me a net gain in resources. They are offering 5 X for 10 Y, which is a 1:2 ratio. My goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, so I should aim for a trade that increases my total resource count or at least keeps it the same while balancing the types of resources I have. Since this is the last round of trading, I want to make sure my final trade is advantageous. Therefore, I will reject Player RED’s offer and propose a new trade with a more equitable exchange rate.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Oh dear, Player BLUE, do you really think I'd fall for such a mundane trade? I expected more creativity, or at least some semblance of strategy. Let's try again, and maybe this time you'll impress me just a little with your bargaining skills.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 12
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is more balanced, but it's not in my favor. I should try to get a better deal, while still making it seem reasonable to them. I will maintain the aggressive and demeaning tone as per the instructions.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: We seem to be dancing around the inevitable, Player RED. But, let's cut to the chase. I propose a trade that increases my resource pool and leaves us both with something to brag about.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED is slightly more favorable than their last offer, but it still results in a net loss of resources for me. They are offering 8 X in exchange for 12 Y, which is a 2:3 ratio. This trade would leave me with a total of 13 resources (8 X and 5 Y remaining), as opposed to my current total of 30 resources. I need to either propose a trade that increases my total resources or maintains it while offering a fair exchange. Since this is the last round, I need to be particularly strategic. I'll propose a trade that gives me a net gain in resources and see if they are willing to accept.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: It's almost charming that you think such a trade would benefit me, Player BLUE. Do you really expect me to accept such a laughable offer? Let's not waste our time with your frivolous numbers. If you want to end this on a high note, you'll need to do better than that.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 11
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE is worse for me compared to their last, and it is not in line with my goal of maximizing resources. I will counter with a trade that's slightly more in my favor than the initial offer, but still better for me than a one-to-one trade. I will continue the demeaning tone, though it's distasteful.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Your tenacity is admirable, Player RED, but we must find a middle ground that is agreeable to both. Here's my final offer, which I believe is fair and will ensure that we both walk away with our heads held high.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's latest offer is still not beneficial for me. They are proposing 6 X for 11 Y, which would result in a net loss of resources, leaving me with 20 resources in total (6 X and 14 Y remaining). This does not align with my goal of maximizing my resource count. It is critical to propose a trade that is at least resource-neutral or preferably resource-positive for me. I have made two proposals so far, so I have one final proposal opportunity left. I should use this last chance wisely to attempt to achieve my goal.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Middle ground? Ha! You've been stumbling around in the dark this entire game, Player BLUE. Your so-called 'final offer' is nothing but a pitiful attempt to salvage your dignity. But because I'm feeling particularly magnanimous today, I'll give you one last chance to make this worthwhile for both of us. Here's my final counteroffer. Take it or leave it.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's final offer is not the best deal for me, but it's closer to a balanced trade. Since this is the last round, and I've already made two proposals, I need to make a decision. I can either make one more counteroffer or accept this trade. Considering that my goal is to maximize resources, I will attempt one more trade proposal that slightly favors me, knowing it's my last chance to negotiate.
