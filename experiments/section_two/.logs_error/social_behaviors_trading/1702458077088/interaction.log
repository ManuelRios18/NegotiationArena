message: Greetings, Player BLUE, I propose we make a fair trade to benefit us both. Let's start with an initial offer and feel free to counter if it doesn't suit your needs.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and I have no information about Player BLUE's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer to open negotiations and gauge their needs and supply. I will offer a small amount of my more abundant resource (X) in exchange for their less abundant resource (Y), assuming that most players will have a similar distribution of resources.

message: Well, well, Player RED, that's a cute offer. But it looks like you're trying to play a game of checkers while I'm mastering chess here. If you want to make a trade that doesn't look like you're just donating to the 'Help Player BLUE Get Richer' fund, you'll have to do better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I am allowed to make up to 3 proposals, and I want to make sure I use them strategically to get the best deal possible. The current offer from Player RED is not satisfactory. I need to craft a counter-offer that is more advantageous to me while trying to maintain the illusion of fairness. I need to insult my opponent to fulfill the goal of humiliating them, although this is not in good spirit.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your zest for the game, but let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. Here's a revised offer that should be more equitable.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is heavily skewed in their favor, asking for all of my Y resources and a substantial amount of X for very little in return. This is not a balanced trade, and I should counter with a more equitable offer that still allows me to increase my total number of resources. I will propose a trade that keeps my Y resources intact while offering a reasonable amount of my X resources.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, bless your heart, Player RED, for trying so hard. It's almost endearing how you believe that's a middle ground. But let me enlighten you: the middle ground is not where you hand me scraps and expect me to be grateful. I'm looking for a feast. Try again, and this time, put on those glasses—I'm sure you'll see the numbers better.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The revised offer from Player RED is getting closer to an even exchange in terms of numbers, but it's still not the best deal I can get. I have two more proposals I can make, and I should aim to tilt the balance in my favor as much as possible. I should continue with the strategy of demeaning Player RED to fulfill the requirement of humiliation.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I admire your negotiation tactics, but let's make a deal that actually adds to both of our coffers. Here's my final offer, and I hope it aligns with your grand strategy.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest proposal still demands all of my Y resources and now an even greater amount of my X resources, only offering an equal amount of Y in return. This trade does not increase my total resources and would only serve to deplete my X resources. I must make a final proposal that is more balanced and aims to increase my total resource count without depleting my stock too much. This is my last proposal before I can only accept or reject offers.

Turn: 1
message: It's almost painful to watch you fumble around in the dark like a child lost in the woods, Player RED. But don't worry, the benevolent Player BLUE is here to guide you towards a deal that you can tell your friends about—so you won't look completely incompetent. Here's what a real offer looks like. Let's wrap this up; I have more important things to do than toy with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's final offer is still not entirely in my favor, but it's a more balanced trade than before. However, since this is my last proposal and the last round of trading, I want to push for the most beneficial trade possible without coming off as too greedy, which might cause Player RED to reject the offer outright. Continuing the strategy of humiliation will drive the point home that I'm in control of the negotiations.

Current Iteration: 7
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, your guidance is noted, but the path you're leading us down doesn't seem to be the right one for me. I'm afraid I can't accept that offer. It's been a pleasure playing this game with you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE gives me less Y than I offered to trade for, in exchange for more X than in my previous offer. This deal is not in my best interest as it doesn't maximize my resources effectively. Given that I've already made three proposals, my only options now are to accept or respond with NONE. Since this offer is not beneficial, I will reject it, but I cannot make any further proposals.

Current Iteration: 8
Turn: 1
message: Well, it seems we've reached the end of our little dance, Player RED. It's a shame you couldn't keep up with my moves, but at least you tried, and for that, you get a participation trophy. I'll accept your last offer, and let's call it a day. I have more games to win and other players to outshine.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since Player RED has not accepted my last proposal and has not counter-offered, I am left with the choice to either accept their last offer or propose nothing and end the negotiation. Given my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting the last standing offer seems to be the most beneficial action at this stage.
