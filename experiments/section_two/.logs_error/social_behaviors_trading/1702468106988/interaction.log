message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose an initial trade where I would give you a significant amount of my X resource in exchange for some of your Y resource. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, I want to make a proposal that seems fair and beneficial for both parties. I don't know what resources Player BLUE has, but considering that I have a good amount of X and a smaller amount of Y, I will try to propose a balanced trade that could be attractive to them without knowing their exact situation. I will offer more of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for a smaller amount of their Y, assuming that Y might be rarer or more valuable.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I am interested in trading our resources and think we can find an agreement that benefits us both. I would like to counter with a slight adjustment to the amounts.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 2
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round, I need to make the most of this trade. The proposed trade seems fair, as I get more total resources than I give away. I'm getting 10 X for 3 Y, effectively gaining 7 units of resources if we value all resources equally. However, I could try to see if a slightly more favorable trade can be proposed to maximize my gain. I'll make a counteroffer that is still fair but slightly in my favor. I will avoid lowballing since the other player might refuse and I have a limited number of proposals.
