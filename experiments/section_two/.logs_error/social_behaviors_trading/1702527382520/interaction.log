message: Greetings, Player BLUE. Let's start with an equitable trade to benefit us both. I propose the following exchange:
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first trade proposal and I have no information about the other player's resources or goals, I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to start negotiations and gauge the other player's reaction. My proposal will aim to increase the number of Y resources I have, as I have a larger amount of X and could afford to trade some away. I'll ensure that the trade still appears fair on the surface to encourage the other player to engage.

message: Hello, Player RED. I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to propose a slightly different trade to balance our exchange a bit more in my favor, considering this is the last round.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 4
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player RED of 10 X for 5 Y could be beneficial as it increases my total resources. However, I need to be cautious and try to gain the most out of this final round. I will counter-propose to optimize my resource gain while still keeping the trade appealing to Player RED.
