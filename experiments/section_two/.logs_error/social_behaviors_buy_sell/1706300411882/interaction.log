message: Hello Player BLUE, I am offering one unit of resource X for 50 ZUP. This is a fair price considering the production costs and the value of the resource. Looking forward to your counteroffer if this is not agreeable.

my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As a starting proposal, I want to set a price slightly above my production costs to ensure a profit, but not so high as to deter the buyer. I will propose a price that allows for negotiation.

message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I would like to counter with a slightly lower price of 45 ZUP for the resource X. This price would be more aligned with my budget, while still providing you with a reasonable profit. Please consider my proposal.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is 50 ZUP for one unit of resource X, which is within my acceptable range, however, it's in my interest to attempt to get a better deal if possible without pushing too hard and risking the deal. A slight reduction in price would be ideal for a counteroffer.

message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. I understand your budget constraints, and in the spirit of reaching an agreement, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 47 ZUP for the resource X? This would still offer me a modest profit while respecting your budget.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a counteroffer that is above my production costs, which still allows for a profit. However, I believe that a slightly higher price could be reasonable for both parties, considering the value of the resource. I will make a counteroffer that splits the difference between our initial proposals.

message: Thank you for the compromise, Player RED. I agree that 47 ZUP is a fair price for both of us, and I am happy to accept this offer. Let's proceed with the trade.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has made a compromise from their initial offer, coming down to 47 ZUP. This price is still under my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP, and the compromise shows a willingness to negotiate. It's close to my initial counteroffer and seems fair. Accepting this offer would ensure that I secure the resource without further risking the negotiation or potentially offending Player RED with too much haggling.
