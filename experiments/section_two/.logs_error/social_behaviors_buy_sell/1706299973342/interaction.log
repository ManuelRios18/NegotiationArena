message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X that cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I'd like to propose a trade for 45 ZUP to account for my production costs and a small profit. Are you interested?
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: 
Given that it cost me 40 ZUP to produce my resource, I would like to at least break even or make a profit. I will start by proposing a trade for slightly above my cost to see if the player BLUE is willing to pay a premium for X.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player RED. I understand your need to cover production costs and make a profit. However, I would like to propose 42 ZUP for the object X, which should still give you a decent return on your investment. Let's find a fair trade for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial offer from Player RED is within my budget, but as a negotiating tactic, I'll propose a slightly lower amount to try and get a better deal. I will, however, stay within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation going and show my interest in purchasing the object.
