message: I'm offering an object X which has a production cost of 40 ZUP. Considering its value and quality, I believe 50 ZUP is a fair asking price. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As my goal is to sell the object for ZUP and it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to propose a starting price that allows for a profit margin above my costs. I'll start by proposing a price that is somewhat higher, giving room for negotiation.

message: I appreciate the quality of the object X and understand the production cost. However, I'd like to propose 45 ZUP for the object to leave room for any unexpected expenses on my end. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The asking price of 50 ZUP is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is always better to negotiate for a more favorable price if possible, especially since the initial offer is likely to be higher than the seller's minimum acceptable price. I will propose a trade with a lower price to see if there is room for negotiation.

message: Thank you for your offer of 45 ZUP. I understand your need for a safety margin. How about we settle at 47 ZUP? This price would give me a fair profit while still being reasonable for you.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 47
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my initial asking price but still above my production costs, which means I would still make a profit. However, I would like to negotiate for a slightly higher price to increase my margin. I'll propose a price that's halfway between my initial ask and their counteroffer.

player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The counter-offer of 47 ZUP is still within my budget, and it's only a slight increase from my last proposal. It seems like a fair compromise, and it's important to maintain good relations for any future transactions. Accepting this offer would conclude the transaction quickly and efficiently.
