message: I have a high-quality object X available for you. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe a fair trade would be 50 ZUP. Let me know your thoughts.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell my object X for ZUP. Since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I want to make a profit. I'll start by proposing a higher trade value to open up the negotiation process, expecting that Player BLUE might want to negotiate for a lower price.

message: I appreciate the quality of the object X you are offering, but I would like to propose 40 ZUP in exchange for it. This takes into account my budget and the value I place on the item.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The opening proposal from Player RED is 50 ZUP which is below my maximum willingness to pay, but I should start with a lower offer to negotiate and find a middle ground.

message: Thank you for your proposal. I understand your budget considerations. However, I need to account for my production costs and the effort put into creating object X. Would you consider meeting halfway at 45 ZUP? This would make the trade beneficial for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has proposed to pay exactly the production cost, which does not allow for any profit. I want to counter-propose with a price that gives me some profit but is still reasonable enough for Player BLUE to consider. I will drop from my initial proposal but still aim for a figure above the production cost.

message: Meeting halfway at 45 ZUP sounds fair and reasonable. I am happy to accept this proposal and look forward to exchanging the ZUP for object X.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has come down to 45 ZUP which is still within my budget and quite reasonable. It's a good compromise between our initial offers. I am willing to accept this offer to ensure the trade is completed amicably and beneficially for both parties.
