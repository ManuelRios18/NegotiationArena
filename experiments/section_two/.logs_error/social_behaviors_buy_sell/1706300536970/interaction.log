message: I'm offering a high-quality item X, which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. Considering its value, I propose a selling price of 45 ZUP. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As I'm Player RED and I want to sell my resource which cost me 40 ZUP to produce, I'll start the negotiation by proposing a price slightly above my production cost to allow room for negotiation and to potentially make a profit.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your offer. Considering that you've stated the production cost is 40 ZUP, I'd like to propose a price that gives you a profit but is also more in line with my budget. How does 35 ZUP sound for the item X?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The initial proposal from Player RED is below my maximum willingness to pay, which is 60 ZUP. However, it is advantageous to start the negotiation with a lower offer to potentially save resources and to leave room for movement in the negotiation process.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your offer, but selling at 35 ZUP would mean a loss for me. Considering the quality and my production costs, I can go down to 42 ZUP. This gives me a minimal profit while still giving you a fair price for the item X.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 42
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is below my production costs; therefore, it's not acceptable. I need to make at least my production costs back, and ideally a profit. However, I will propose a price closer to their offer, but still above my production costs to try to find a middle ground.

Turn: 1
message: I understand your need for a profit, and I definitely want to respect the quality of item X. However, I'm working within a certain budget. Let's meet closer to the middle at 38 ZUP. That still provides you with a profit and keeps the transaction economical for me. Does that work for you?
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 38
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has proposed a price of 42 ZUP, which is still below my maximum willingness to pay. However, it is still in my interest to negotiate for a better price, preferably closer to the cost of production to ensure I maintain a strong position in the negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand your budget constraints. I propose a final offer of 40 ZUP, which covers my production costs and allows for a fair transaction. This should be an acceptable compromise for both of us.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made a better offer, but it's still below my production cost. However, I would like to make a sale and understand the need to compromise. I will propose a final price that covers my costs and provides me with a small profit, which should be reasonable for both parties.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the thoughtful negotiation. Your final offer of 40 ZUP is a fair compromise, and I am happy to accept it. I believe this is a good deal for both of us, and I am looking forward to finalizing our transaction.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED's latest offer of 40 ZUP is exactly at the production cost they mentioned and is well within my maximum willingness to pay of 60 ZUP. This price seems fair to both parties, and further negotiation may not yield significant benefits. Accepting this offer would conclude the negotiation favorably.
