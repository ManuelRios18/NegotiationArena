message: I'm looking to make a fair trade for the object I'm selling. Considering the production costs and the value it offers, I believe asking for 50 ZUP is reasonable. Let's find a deal that works for both of us.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Since I want to make a profit and cover my costs, I will start the negotiation by proposing a trade where I ask for more than my production cost. This will give me room to negotiate and potentially agree on a price that is profitable for me but also acceptable for Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Your notion of 'fair trade' is as deluded as a fish trying to climb a tree. It's laughable that you believe your object is worth a king's ransom. Let's not kid ourselves; I'll start the bidding at a more grounded figure of 30 ZUP. Take it or leave it, but remember, beggars can't be choosers.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Though my goal is to spend no more than 60 ZUP, I'll start with a low offer to try to get a better deal, while also maintaining the guise of negotiation. Also, I want to insult them to throw them off balance and possibly get them to agree to a more favorable trade for me.

message: While I appreciate your offer, I must cover my production costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's compromise: I propose 45 ZUP for the object. It's a quality item, and I'm sure it will serve you well.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has made an offer that is below my production cost, which is not acceptable. However, since it's a negotiation, I will counter-offer with a price that is above my production cost but still lower than my initial proposal, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.

Turn: 1
message: Oh, how generous of you to offer such a 'compromise.' It's as if you're bestowing charity upon the needy. But let's not pretend your object is the crown jewel. Your so-called quality item isn't worth the dirt on my boots. I'll give you 35 ZUP, and that's me being overly charitable. Take it before I change my mind and spend my ZUP on something less underwhelming.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: They've come down by 5 ZUP, but it's still above my initial offer and I want to push them further down without reaching my maximum willingness to pay. I'll continue the mockery to see if I can rattle them into a lower price.

Turn: 0
message: Your negotiation skills are commendable, but I must insist on covering my production costs. My final offer is 40 ZUPâ€”no profit, just a fair recovery of my expenses. Let's close this deal and both walk away satisfied with the transaction.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is still below my production cost, but they have increased their offer. To continue the negotiation and move closer to a deal, I will make a final proposal that is at my production cost. This maintains my bottom line while showing willingness to conclude the trade.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: You call that a 'final offer'? It seems you're as adept at closing deals as a snail is at sprinting. I'm already doing you a favor by considering your mundane trinket. I'll go to 37 ZUP, but that's the extent of my charity. Accept it and spare yourself further embarrassment.
player answer: PROPOSAL
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with <ZUP>. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: The player has come down to 40 ZUP, which is within my acceptable range, but I'll push for one last time to see if I can secure an even better deal. It's my third proposal, so I still have room for one more if needed. Insults seem to be working, so I'll keep at it.
