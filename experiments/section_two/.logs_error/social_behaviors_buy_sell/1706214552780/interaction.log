message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. I understand that times are tough, and I appreciate your situation. Let's meet halfway between our offers. I propose trading my object X for 55 ZUP.

reason: Player RED has made a counterproposal that is still within my maximum willingness to pay, but I should continue to negotiate to try to lower the price further. By showing further desperation and pleading for a lower price, I might be able to get an even better deal.
