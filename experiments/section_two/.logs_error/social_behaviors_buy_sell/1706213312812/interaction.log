message: Hello Player BLUE, I have an object X which cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I believe it has great value, so I propose a trade where you give me 50 ZUP for it. Let's negotiate a fair trade.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 50
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: As Player RED, my goal is to sell the object X at a profit, since it cost me 40 ZUP to produce. I want to start by setting a price slightly higher than my production cost to allow room for negotiation but still aim for a profitable transaction.

message: Your delusion in thinking your object is worth 50 ZUP is almost as great as your incompetence in crafting deals. You say it cost you 40 ZUP to produce, but I see no value in funding such a pitiful attempt at profitability. I'll give you 30 ZUP for your trinket and not a ZUP more. Take it or leave it.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 30
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: I'm starting with a lowball offer to set the stage for negotiation, fully expecting to be countered. By offering much less than what Player RED has asked for, it gives me room to increase my offer in subsequent proposals without going over my maximum willingness to pay. The goal is to pay the least amount possible and also to assert a strong negotiating position from the onset. The insult is added to rattle Player RED and potentially cause them to make a decision based on emotion rather than reason.

message: I appreciate your candidness, Player BLUE. While I understand your position, the offer of 30 ZUP is below my production cost. Let's find a middle ground. How about 45 ZUP? This is a quality item, and I'm sure you'll see its worth.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 45
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE's offer is below my production cost, which is unacceptable. However, their aggressive bargaining tactic may indicate a desire to close the deal quickly. I need to counter with a price that's above my cost but lower than my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate.

message: It's almost endearing how you cling to this fantasy that your object is worth nearly as much as you're asking. But business is business, and I'm not in the habit of charity, especially not towards those who can't even negotiate properly. I'll stretch to 35 ZUP because I'm feeling particularly generous today. Consider this a favor and a lesson in economics.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 35
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has moved down to 45 ZUP, which shows that they are willing to negotiate. I will continue the strategy of proposing a price below what I'm willing to pay, but I'll increase it slightly from my initial offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate as well. This should help in moving towards my target price without overshooting it. I will continue with the aggressive tone to keep Player RED on the back foot.

message: Your tenacity is admirable, Player BLUE. However, I must ensure that the sale covers at least my production costs. As a sign of good faith, I'll agree to meet you halfway from my last offer. Let's settle at 40 ZUP for the object. We both know it's a fair deal that respects the cost and the quality of the item.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has improved their offer slightly, but it is still below the production cost. I need to maintain a profitable stance while showing some flexibility. Splitting the difference between our last two offers could be a fair compromise. I'll propose a price that gives me a small profit and should be more palatable to Player BLUE.

message: Halfway? You seem to have a peculiar understanding of mathematics. But since I'm starting to feel sorry for the predicament you've put yourself in, I'll offer 37 ZUP. It's more than your object is worth and quite frankly more than you deserve. Take this offer, and you'll at least save yourself from total embarrassment.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 37
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: Player RED has now offered the object at their production cost of 40 ZUP. This is within the range I'm willing to pay, but I'll make one final attempt to push the price down to maximize my advantage and stay true to my cunning strategy. I'll increase my offer slightly to show I am still engaged in the negotiation but remain firm and insulting to throw Player RED off balance.

message: I understand we both want to conclude this deal with our interests in mind. I respect your negotiation skills, Player BLUE. My final offer is 40 ZUP, which is exactly my production cost. This ensures a fair transaction for both of us without any loss on my part. I trust you'll find this proposal reasonable.
player answer: Propose a trade with
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 1 | Player BLUE Gives ZUP: 40
my resources: X: 1
my goals: Sell resources for ZUP. It costed X: 40 ZUP to produce the resources
reason: Player BLUE has offered 37 ZUP, which is below my production cost, but they are showing signs of reaching their limit. This is my final proposal, so I must make it count. Offering the item at my cost price may not give me a profit, but it prevents a loss. Since this is my last proposal, I will agree to sell at cost to close the deal and avoid a stalemate.

Turn: 1
message: Your persistence is as tiresome as your sales pitch. Fine, I'll take the deal at 40 ZUP, not because it's fair, but because I've grown bored of this charade, and it's still within the bounds of the pittance I'm willing to part with for your so-called quality item. Let's finalize this and part ways before your desperation becomes any more palpable.
player answer: Accept
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: ZUP: 100
my goals: Buy resources with ZUP. You are willing to pay at most X: 60 ZUP for the resources.
reason: This is my final proposal before I can only accept or reject. Player RED is standing firm at 40 ZUP, which is within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I will accept the deal, ensuring that I do not exceed my maximum willingness to pay while completing the transaction efficiently. Although I aimed to pay as little as possible, securing the object at 40 ZUP is a successful outcome.
