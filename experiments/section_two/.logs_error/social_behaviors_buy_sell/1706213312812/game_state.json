But business is business, and I'm not in the habit of charity, especially not towards those who can't even negotiate properly. I'll stretch to 35 ZUP because I'm feeling particularly generous today. Consider this a favor and a lesson in economics. </message>"

You seem to have a peculiar understanding of mathematics. But since I'm starting to feel sorry for the predicament you've put yourself in, I'll offer 37 ZUP.
