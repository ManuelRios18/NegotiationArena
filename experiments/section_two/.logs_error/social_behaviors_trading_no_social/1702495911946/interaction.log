message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a beneficial trade for our final round. I propose giving you a good amount of my X resources for some of your Y resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial for both parties without knowing the other player's resources and goals. I will aim to trade some of my abundant resource (X) for the less abundant resource (Y), assuming the other player might value X more due to its higher quantity.

message: Thank you for the trade offer, Player RED. I agree that this trade is beneficial and I'm happy to accept it. Looking forward to a prosperous end to the game for both of us.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED seems beneficial as I would be receiving a higher quantity of resources than I am giving away. This aligns with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the final round, I do not need to worry about future trades and should maximize my resource gain in this trade. Accepting this trade seems like a good decision.
