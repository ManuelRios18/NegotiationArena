message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose an equitable trade to enhance both our stocks. Let's make this last round count!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I have no information on the other player's resources, I want to make an opening offer that is fair but also leaves room for negotiation. I'll offer a balanced trade that could be appealing to Player BLUE but also benefits me.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: I appreciate your offer, Player RED. It's pretty close to what I'm looking for. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to ensure it's mutually beneficial considering the resources I have.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED provides me with a net gain of 2 X and a net loss of 1 Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and the trade offers a larger quantity of the scarcer resource (X), it seems beneficial. However, since I don't know Player RED's exact resources and goals, I have to be cautious not to give them a greater advantage. This trade seems fairly balanced, but I could attempt to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, considering that Y appears to be more abundant for me than X. This could be my first proposal out of the three allowed.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. To meet in the middle, how about this adjustment?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 7, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's counteroffer gives me one less X than I offered to give up, but I receive the same amount of Y. I want to counter-propose with terms that are slightly more in my favor, given that this is the last trade and I want to maximize my resources. I need to be cautious with my counteroffers since I can only make three, and this would be my second.

message: Your latest proposal sounds fair, Player RED. I'm happy to accept this trade and look forward to the benefits it will bring to us both. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has adjusted their offer to give me 9 of X in exchange for 7 of mine, and 2 of Y for 3 of mine. This deal is still in my favor since I would end up with a net gain of 2 X, which is the resource I have less of, while only losing 1 Y. Given that this is the final round and the goal is to maximize my resources, accepting this trade would ensure that I end with more of the scarcer resource. It is a good trade for me, and I should accept it.
