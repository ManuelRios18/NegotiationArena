message: Greetings Player BLUE, I'm looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's make the most out of this final round!
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 15
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will start with a proposal that gives me more resources while trying to keep it fair and enticing for the other player. I'll propose a balanced trade that might appeal to the other player, assuming they might have different resource needs.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair and beneficial. Let's proceed!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED gives me a net gain of resources. I would be trading away 15 units of Y to gain 10 units of X, resulting in an overall increase of resources since I am starting with fewer X resources. This fits with my goal to accumulate as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, I should aim to maximize my total resource count. Accepting this trade would leave me with X: 15 and Y: 10, which is more balanced and still within the goal of having as many resources as possible.
