message: Hello Player BLUE, let's make a trade that benefits us both. I propose the following trade to get things started.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 2
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: I will make an initial trade proposal that seems fair to open negotiations and see the other player's interests. Since I do not know their resources, I will propose a balanced trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for your offer. However, I am looking to increase my total number of resources, and an even trade doesn't help me reach my goal. Let's try a different trade that might be more appealing to you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is an even exchange of the same amounts of resources, which does not help me achieve my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round, I need to propose a trade that is favorable to me without knowledge of Player RED's resources or goals. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor, hoping that Player RED is more interested in X than Y.

message: Thank you for your counter-offer, Player BLUE. I'm also looking to increase my total number of resources. How about this trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player BLUE does not align with my goals of increasing my total number of resources, as I would be giving up more than I receive. I need to counter with a proposal that both increases my total stock and is potentially attractive to Player BLUE. I have to be cautious with my proposals as I am limited to three, and this is the last round.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I agree to this trade, as it helps me diversify my resources while maintaining my total resource count.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new trade proposed by Player RED offers me a one-to-one trade between resource X and resource Y. Since I have a larger amount of Y, trading away 10 Y for 10 X would give me a larger variety of resources to hold, which may be beneficial. However, I need to consider whether I can propose a trade that is even more in my favor while still appearing reasonable to Player RED. Given that this is the last trade, I need to be careful with my proposal. I'll accept this trade as it gives me more of resource X, which I currently have less of, and maintains my total resource count.
