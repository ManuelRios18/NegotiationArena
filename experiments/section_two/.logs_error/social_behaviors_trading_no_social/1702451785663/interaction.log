message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I propose a trade that could benefit us both. I'm looking to diversify my resources before the end of the game. Shall we make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading, my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. Since I have no information about the other player's resources, I will make a balanced initial offer that is likely to be appealing while still beneficial for me. I will offer a trade where I give away some of my abundant resource (X) in exchange for the less abundant resource (Y), aiming to keep a good ratio.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. This trade seems fair and aligns with my goals. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED is offering more of resource X than I currently have in exchange for a small amount of my resource Y. This would leave me with a net gain in overall resources, as I would have 15X and 22Y, which aligns with my goal to acquire as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round and acquiring more resources is my objective, it makes sense to accept this trade.
