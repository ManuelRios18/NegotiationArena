message: Hello Player BLUE, I am interested in making a trade that is beneficial for us both. I propose to exchange some of my X for some of your Y. Let's start with this offer and adjust as necessary.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to propose a trade that is beneficial but also attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider. However, since I don't know their resources, I will start with a balanced offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I would like to propose a counteroffer where the exchange rate is slightly in my favor since I am looking to acquire as many resources as possible. How about I give you a bit less Y for your X?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Without knowledge of Player RED's resources, it is difficult to evaluate the fairness of the proposed trade. However, based on my goal to acquire as many resources as possible, I should aim to negotiate a trade that maximizes my total resource count. The current offer is a 1:1 trade of X for Y, which may not be the most advantageous for me. I should attempt to propose a counteroffer that gives me a better exchange rate, favoring the acquisition of more X resources since I have a greater amount of Y. This is my first proposal, so I must be strategic but open to negotiation.

Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a favorable exchange. How about we meet in the middle? I propose giving you slightly less X for the amount of Y you offered. I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 9 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE is for less Y than I originally asked for. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to negotiate for a more favorable exchange. However, I should also be careful not to propose something that is too unattractive for Player BLUE, as this could end negotiations. I will make a counteroffer that meets us halfway between my original offer and Player BLUE's counteroffer.

Turn: 1
message: This sounds like a reasonable compromise, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal. Let's exchange my 8 Y for your 9 X.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is an improvement from the initial offer, with a more favorable exchange rate for me. By accepting this trade, I would increase my total resource count by 1, which aligns with my goal. Furthermore, since this is the last round of trading, it's crucial to make a decision that will leave me with the highest number of resources possible. I should accept this offer.
