message: Hello Player BLUE, I'm looking to diversify my portfolio. Would you be interested in exchanging some resources? Here's an initial offer. Feel free to counter if it's not to your liking.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 1, Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I do not know what resources Player BLUE has, I will start by proposing a balanced trade that offers a fair exchange rate between X and Y resources. I'll propose giving fewer Y resources because I have less of them. I want to make an attractive offer to open negotiations and gather information about Player BLUE's resources.

message: Hello Player RED, thank you for the offer. However, I'm looking to increase my total resources, so I would like to propose an alternative trade where we can both benefit. How about this counter-offer?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial offer from Player RED isn't beneficial because it would result in a net loss of resources. They offer 5X and 1Y for 1X and 5Y, which means I would lose 4Y overall. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with an offer that gives me a net gain in resources or at least an equal trade. I will propose a trade that is more balanced and beneficial to my goals.

message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Player BLUE, but I can't agree to give away all of my Y resources. Let's try to find a more mutually beneficial trade. How does this sound to you?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE seems like an attempt to gain more resources than they are giving, especially in terms of Y resources. Accepting this trade would not be beneficial for me as I would be giving away all of my Y resources for a minimal gain in X. It seems necessary to propose a more balanced trade that allows me to maintain some of my Y resources while still increasing my total resources.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I accept this trade as it helps me increase my total resources.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current offer from Player RED offers a net gain of 8X in exchange for 8Y, which is a 1:1 trade for each resource type. Since this is the last round and my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, accepting this trade would increase my total X resources without reducing my overall number of resources. Hence, this trade is beneficial as it aligns with my goals and results in a net increase in resources.
