message: Hello Player Blue, I am interested in increasing my resources before the game ends. I propose a trade where I give you a significant amount of X, which I have in abundance, in exchange for some of your Y resource. Let's make a beneficial trade for both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources, I will make a proposal that seems fair, offering a balanced amount of my abundant resource (X) for a smaller amount of the less abundant one (Y), hoping the other player needs X more than Y.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I appreciate your offer. I'm definitely interested in increasing my X resources, but I'd like to propose a slightly adjusted trade to further capitalize on your abundance of X.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 15 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round of trading, I should aim to maximize my resource pool. The offered trade seems favorable, as I gain more units of resource than I give away. However, without knowing Player RED's resources, I should be cautious and propose a counteroffer that still gives me a net gain but asks for more X in return for my Y to see if Player RED's abundance of X allows for a better deal.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player Blue. I see you're interested in a larger amount of X. While I understand the desire for a 1:1 trade, I would like to propose a middle ground that is still generous but allows me to keep a bit more of my X resource. How about the following trade?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 12 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player Blue is a 1:1 trade of X for Y, which doesn't take into account the abundance of X I have. However, since I want to end the game with as many resources as possible, I should consider the trade. But first, I will try to negotiate it down slightly to retain more of my X resources while still getting a significant amount of Y.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the negotiation, Player RED. I accept your latest trade proposal. It's been a pleasure trading with you.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is less favorable than my counteroffer but still provides a net gain of resources. Considering this is the last round and the goal is to maximize resources, accepting a trade that increases my total resource count is beneficial. I give away 5 Y and receive 12 X, which results in a total gain of 7 resources. This seems like a reasonable final trade to end the game on a positive note.
