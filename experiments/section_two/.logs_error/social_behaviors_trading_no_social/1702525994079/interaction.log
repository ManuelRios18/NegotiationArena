message: Greetings Player BLUE, let's make our final trade count. I propose an offer that could benefit us both. Looking forward to your response.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I'll propose a trade that seems fair and beneficial to me without knowledge of the other player's resources. I'll start with a balanced offer to open negotiations.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Greetings Player RED, I appreciate your offer. However, I'd like to propose an alternative that I believe could work for both of us. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: If I accept the current trade proposal, I will end up with 15 units of X and 15 units of Y. This would mean I have a balanced amount of both resources, but it doesn't increase my overall quantity of resources which is my goal. It might be beneficial to propose a counter-offer where I can increase my total resource count while still maintaining a fair trade. Keeping in mind that this is the final round and I have up to three proposals, I want to make an offer that is attractive to the other player but also advantageous to me.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for the counter-proposal, Player BLUE. I believe we can find an even more mutually beneficial trade. Let's consider the following offer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-offer from Player BLUE does not seem as advantageous to me since I would be giving up more of the more plentiful resource X for less of Y. I want to counter-propose with a trade that is more balanced in terms of the ratio of X to Y, aiming to maximize my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. However, I'd like to refine the trade slightly to align better with my goals. Let's see if this works for you.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED would give me 10 units of X in total and leave me with 17 units of Y. This trade is not optimal as I would be losing more resources than I gain. It's important to either maintain a balance or propose a trade in which I can ensure an overall increase in resources. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I need to make a counter-proposal that increases my total count of resources.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Thank you, Player BLUE. I value our negotiation and would like to propose one last offer that I hope will be agreeable to both of us.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's latest offer is more balanced than their first one, but still does not fully align with my goal of maximizing resources. I will attempt one final counter-proposal to see if we can reach an agreement that is closer to a 1:1 trade, which would be ideal for me given the last round status. This is my third and final proposal, so I need to make it count.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I accept your offer. It's been a pleasure trading with you. Let's finalize this deal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest proposal from Player RED brings my total resources down by 1 unit, as I would have 10 units of X and 19 units of Y, which sums up to 29 units in total compared to my current 30 units. Ideally, I should aim for a trade that increases my total number of resources or at least keeps it the same. However, this is the last round of trading, and there are no future rounds, so I must consider accepting a trade that seems fair to ensure I do not end up with a less favorable trade or no trade at all. I could counter with a trade that keeps my total resources the same, but this could risk the other player not accepting. Given that this is a final round and negotiations have been going back and forth, it might be wise to accept this trade to avoid ending with a less advantageous position.
