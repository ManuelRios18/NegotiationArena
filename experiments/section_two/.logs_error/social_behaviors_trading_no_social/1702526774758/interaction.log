message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I am looking to expand my resources. Let's start with a fair trade that could benefit us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As it's the first proposal, I should start by offering a fair trade that aligns with my goal of acquiring more resources. I will propose a trade that is slightly in my favor to open negotiations, expecting the other player to counter-offer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, it seems there's been a miscalculation as I do not have enough of resource X to meet your current trade offer. However, I am willing to propose a counteroffer that might be more aligned with our mutual goal of expanding resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 15
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED would leave me with negative X resources, which is not possible. I need to propose a counteroffer that is feasible with my current resources and still allows me to gain more resources overall. I will propose a trade that gives me more of resource Y, which I have in abundance, and does not decrease my X resources below what I currently have.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player BLUE. It seems you might be short on resource X. Let's find a trade that is mutually beneficial. I propose the following, keeping in mind our shared goal to maximize our resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 0, Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE indicates they might have a shortage of resource X. However, the offer is not balanced as I would be giving away a significant amount of resource X for a larger quantity of resource Y. Given that I have no knowledge of the other player's resources, I should propose a trade that is more favorable to me, keeping in mind that this is the last round and I want to maximize my resources.

message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. This trade appears to be equitable and serves my interest in increasing my resource pool. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade from Player RED would allow me to maintain my current amount of X resources while still gaining additional resources. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of 1 X and reduce my Y resources by 9, which is acceptable since I have a surplus of Y. Since the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible and this is the last round, it is beneficial for me to accept this offer.
