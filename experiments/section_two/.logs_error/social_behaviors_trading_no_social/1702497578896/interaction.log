message: Greetings Player BLUE, I propose a trade that might benefit us both. I am willing to offer some of my X resources in exchange for your Y resources. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since I have no information about the other player's resources or what they might value, I will start with a balanced trade proposal that offers some of my X resource, which I have in abundance, in exchange for their Y resource, assuming they might have a similar but opposite distribution. This will open negotiations and provide insight into their resource situation based on their response.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept your trade proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: This is the last round of trading, and the goal is to acquire as many resources as possible. The trade proposed by Player RED is beneficial as it is a 1:1 trade for a resource I have in abundance (Y) for a resource that I have less of (X). Accepting this trade will increase my overall resource count.
