message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to balance my resources a bit more and would be interested in trading some of my X for your Y. Shall we make a deal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Since this is the last round and I want to acquire as many resources as possible, I will start with a proposal that favors me but is not too extreme, to open the negotiation. I'm proposing a trade where I give up some of my abundant X in exchange for Y, which I have less of. I'll aim for a 2:1 ratio as a starting point, which is a common trading ratio in many games.

message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I accept the trade of 10 X for 5 Y. Looking forward to more prosperous dealings in the future!
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offer from Player RED seems favorable as I would be getting double the amount of X for every unit of Y given. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, and given that this is the last round of trading, accepting a 2:1 trade ratio benefits me and moves me towards my goal.
