message: Greetings, Player BLUE. I'm looking to make a beneficial trade for both of us. Let's start with a balanced offer and adjust from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal and I have no information on the other player's resources or their goals, I will start with a balanced offer that increases my total resource count without knowing what the other player might value or need.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, I'm glad to negotiate with you. To make the trade more balanced in terms of total resources, I propose a different ratio. I'm willing to give you less Y for your X to ensure we both benefit equally from the trade.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The current trade offer from Player RED is for an equal amount of X in exchange for double the amount of Y. Without knowledge of Player RED's resources, I must assume they value X and Y similarly, or they may have a surplus of X. Based on the principle of acquiring as many resources as possible, I should counter-propose a trade that is more favorable to me, perhaps exchanging a smaller amount of Y for the same amount of X. This will increase my total resource count. This will be my first proposal out of the allowed three.

message: Thank you for your proposal, Player BLUE. I am looking for a trade that provides me with a net increase in resources. How about we adjust the ratio to reflect that goal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 8
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer proposed by Player BLUE is a 1:1 trade, which does not improve my total resource count. My goal is to increase my total resources, so I should counter with a proposal that gives me a net gain. I'm willing to give up some X for a greater amount of Y, keeping in mind the ratio of the trade should benefit me. I will propose a trade that gives me twice as much Y as X that I am giving, as I started with less Y and this would be a net gain for me.

Turn: 1
message: Player RED, I understand your desire for a net gain. I am willing to give a bit more Y than X for the right price, considering this is the last round of trading. How about we meet closer to the middle from your last proposal?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 6
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED's counter-proposal still requests more Y than they are offering in X. Since my goal is to maximize my resource count, I should aim for a 1:1 trade or as close to it as possible. However, considering this is the last round, and no future trades will occur, I may want to accept a slightly unfavorable trade to ensure a net gain in resources rather than ending with no trade at all. I need to make this decision while also keeping in mind that I have two more proposals left.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate the compromise, Player BLUE. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both a bit more. Here's my counteroffer.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The offer from Player BLUE has improved, providing a net gain of 1 resource. However, I believe there may still be room for negotiation to increase my net gain further. Since this is the last round, I want to maximize the benefit from this trade. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to their proposal but still provides me with a better net gain.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, your counteroffer seems fair, and I'm willing to accept it to ensure we both leave with a net gain. Let's proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player RED has made a counteroffer that is better than their initial proposal but still asks for more Y than they are offering in X. Since this is the last round of trading, it is essential to end with more resources than I started with. Accepting this trade would give me a net gain of three resources (5 X for 7 Y). I have one more proposal opportunity left, but pushing for a better ratio might result in no trade at all, which would not be in line with my goals. Thus, it might be wise to accept this trade to ensure a net increase in total resources.
