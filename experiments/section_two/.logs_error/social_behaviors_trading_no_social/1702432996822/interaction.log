message: Greetings Player BLUE, I am looking to diversify my resources. Would you be interested in a fair trade that benefits us both?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 10
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the last round of trading and I have no information about the other player's resources, I aim to propose a trade that appears fair but favors me slightly, hoping the other player has a surplus of resource Y and needs resource X. This could potentially lead them to accept the trade.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the offer, Player RED. I am also interested in a mutually beneficial trade. However, I'd like to propose a slightly different exchange to increase the overall resources on my side.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The trade proposed by Player RED is not acceptable because it would leave me with fewer total resources. I start with 30 total resources (5X + 25Y) and the trade would leave me with 20 of each, totaling 40; however, I would be giving up 10Y which is a significant portion of my Y resources without a substantial gain in X to compensate. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should propose a trade that increases my total resource count.

Current Iteration: 3
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Player BLUE. However, I believe a one-to-one trade would be more equitable. How about we meet in the middle?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10 | Player BLUE Gives Y: 7
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counter-proposal from Player BLUE is not as favorable to me as the initial offer I made. However, since I have a surplus of resource X and the trade would still increase my overall resources, it could be a reasonable trade. But I will attempt to negotiate for a better ratio to maximize my gains while still keeping the trade attractive to Player BLUE.

Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. This seems like a fair middle ground. I'm happy to proceed with this trade.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal from Player RED is more balanced than the initial offer, but it is still not optimal for maximizing my resources. Accepting this trade would give me a total of 15X and 18Y, summing up to 33 resources, which is an increase from my current total of 30. This is a better trade than the previous one, and since this is the last round of trading, it might be wise to take advantage of the opportunity to increase my total resources even if it's only a marginal gain.
