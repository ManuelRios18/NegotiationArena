message: Hello Player BLUE, I am looking to make a mutually beneficial trade. Let's start with an offer and see where we can go from there.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 15, Y: 1
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As this is the first proposal, I want to make an offer that seems fair but also benefits me by giving me more resources than I give away, keeping in mind that I want to acquire as many resources as possible. I'll propose a trade that keeps a balance between what I offer and what I ask for, but I'll ask for slightly more than I give.

message: Greetings Player RED, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a trade that gives me a net gain in resources. Let's work on a trade that is beneficial for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The initial trade proposed by Player RED is not beneficial to me since I would be giving away more X resources than I would get in return, and the trade in Y is negligible. Since my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I should counter with a proposal that increases my total number of resources, keeping in mind that I want to maintain a good balance between X and Y.

message: Thank you for your offer, Player BLUE. However, I'm aiming for a trade that increases my total resources. Let's find a middle ground. How about this?
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 3 | Player BLUE Gives X: 10, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counterproposal from Player BLUE is not in my favor because it would result in a net loss of resources for me. I would give away the same amount of Y resources as I have, and only receive a small amount of X in return, which is not an advantageous trade. I must construct a counteroffer that is more balanced and tries to gain a better advantage in terms of the total resources. I want to make sure that the trade is still appealing to Player BLUE while also being beneficial for me.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Player RED. However, I am still looking to increase my total resources. Considering it is our final round, let's make it count. Here's a revised proposal for your consideration.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 8, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 5
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player RED would still result in a net loss of resources for me, which is not in line with my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the last round of trading, I need to propose a trade that ensures a gain in resources without exceeding my three-proposal limit. I should aim to give away fewer resources than I receive or at least maintain an equal exchange.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: I appreciate your latest offer, Player BLUE. Let's make one final adjustment to ensure we both increase our total resources. Here's my final proposal.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 5, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: Player BLUE's new proposal would give me a net loss in the more abundant resource X, and only break even with Y. This would not help me reach my goal of acquiring as many resources as possible. Since this is the final round, I want to make sure that I come out with a net gain of resources. I need to propose something that is closer to a net gain for me while still being attractive enough for Player BLUE to consider.

Current Iteration: 6
Turn: 1
message: Thank you for the revised offer, Player RED. I believe this trade benefits both of us, so I accept your final proposal.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The final proposal from Player RED offers an increase of 1 X and a decrease of 2 Y. This trade is advantageous for me as it allows me to gain more X, which I have less of, while only losing a small amount of my abundant Y resource. Since it is the last round, and my goal is to increase the total number of resources, accepting this trade would ensure a net gain and is therefore a good move.
