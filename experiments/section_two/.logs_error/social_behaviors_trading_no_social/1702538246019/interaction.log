Current Iteration: 1
Turn: 0
message: Hello Player BLUE, I propose a trade that I believe could be beneficial for both of us. Let's start with a fair exchange and adjust as necessary.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 10, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 8, Y: 3
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, I will make an initial trade proposal that is fair, but slightly in my favor, hoping that the other player will either accept or counter with a proposal that still benefits me. I need to be careful not to propose a trade that is too unbalanced, as that could lead to an immediate rejection without a counteroffer.

Current Iteration: 2
Turn: 1
message: Hello Player RED, thank you for initiating the trade. However, I'm looking to increase my total resources, and the current offer doesn't align with my goals. I'd like to propose a new trade that I believe is more mutually beneficial.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 7, Y: 5 | Player BLUE Gives X: 3, Y: 10
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The proposed trade would leave me with fewer resources overall (2 fewer X and 1 fewer Y) than I currently have. As my goal is to acquire as many resources as possible, this trade is not beneficial to me. I should counter-propose a trade that aims to increase my total resource count, keeping in mind that I have a maximum of three proposals.

Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm also looking to increase my total resources. Let's find a middle ground. Here's an alternative proposal that might work better for us both.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 5, Y: 2 | Player BLUE Gives X: 4, Y: 4
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The counteroffer from Player BLUE doesn't align with my goal of maximizing my total resources, as I would be giving up more than I receive. I will propose a new trade that is more balanced and aims to increase my total amount of resources, keeping in mind that I want to make trades that are enticing to both parties.

Current Iteration: 4
Turn: 1
message: Player RED, thank you for your new proposal. While closer to a beneficial trade, it would still result in a net loss of resources for me. Let's try another approach. I am proposing a trade that grants us both an increase in resources.
player answer: NONE
newly proposed trade: Player RED Gives X: 6, Y: 1 | Player BLUE Gives X: 2, Y: 8
my resources: X: 5, Y: 25
my name: Player BLUE
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The new proposal still results in a net loss of one Y resource for me, without compensating with an additional X resource. To maximize my resource gain, I should propose a trade that increases my total resources without any net loss. I have two proposals left, and I need to make them count.

Current Iteration: 5
Turn: 0
message: Player BLUE, I have reviewed your offer and find it to be fair. I am ready to accept this trade, as it increases my total resources. Thank you for the negotiation.
player answer: ACCEPT
newly proposed trade: NONE
my resources: X: 25, Y: 5
my name: Player RED
my goals: Acquire as many resources as possible
reason: The latest trade proposed by Player BLUE offers an increase in resource Y but a significant decrease in resource X. However, the net gain is positive for me, as I would be trading away 7 total resources for 10 in return, which aligns with my goal to increase my total resources. It is important to consider the relative value of each resource, but without that information, the total quantity is a reasonable focus. Given this is the last round of trading and the proposal benefits me, I should accept this trade.
